The First Officer and I were the only people onboard. The aircraft had spent 3 days in Maintenance for a previous gear extension write up.Upon arrival; when we attempted to extend the landing gear down; the only indication we received was three red gear unlocked indications. We retracted the gear handle and the indications went back to lights out normal retraction. We attempted to extend the gear again and got same indication. No ECAM warning was present. I selected the wheel page to verify the gear was not down and locked. We performed a go-around and got vectors while we worked the issue.We ran the Landing Gear (L/G) not down locked QRH procedure; which lead us to the L/G gravity extension checklist. The checklist was successful. We received 3 green down-locked gear indications. We returned for an ILS. I requested that Crash Fire Rescue be standing by. I also notified ATC as a precaution; but advised ATC we did not require any special assistance. I also advised tower that once we landed; it was possible we would not be able to clear the runway since the QRH procedure disables normal nose wheel steering. The landing was normal and uneventful and I was able to clear runway. We cleared the runway and stopped the aircraft. We advised company and maintenance that we would need to have the aircraft towed to a gate due to lack of nose wheel steering. A company tow vehicle repositioned us to the gate.",,,,"A319 Captain reported malfunctioning landing gear; which required going through QRH procedures to get three green.

I put the pack flow to high to try to increase airflow and ventilation in the cabin. That seemed to help reduce the strength of the odor but it was still present. Upon descent the strength of the odor seemed to increase again. The smell was still present but not very strong upon gate arrival. The Flight Attendants complained of a metallic taste in their throats and excessive thirst. I also noticed being thirsty. The whole crew decided to remove ourselves from duty and go to the on premise medical facility for evaluation. The First Officer and I felt fine and were cleared for duty.

At that time we requesting special/expedited handling. ATC NY approach did a great job prioritizing us. While the workload was high; the Captain included our pilot jump seater in assisting me as the pilot monitoring. All was safely accomplished. The medical situation was coordinated and being handled by flight attendants/medical personnel in the cabin and Dispatch had notified for paramedics to meet us upon arrival. The Captain and I were both doing our normal duties. He was flying. I was pilot monitoring. Communicating with the flight attendants and Dispatch had concluded. While on the arrival receiving radar vectors we were at 5;500 descending. ATC notified us that we had VFR traffic that they were not in contact with 1000 below us. We saw him in the TCAS and watched him maneuver closer to us when we got a TCAS RA. I believe the Captain even saw the traffic visually.  The autopilot was on at the time. I turned off the flight directors as per our procedure. The Captain clicked off the autopilot and followed the TCAS RA. It was a Climb RA; followed by a Monitor Vertical Speed; then a Clear of Conflict. We advised ATC of the TCAS RA to which they responded they watched us respond to it. We came within 400 ft of the traffic. The Captain once clear of conflict continued to hand fly the arrival and approach with autopilot and autothrottles off. We landed safely. Paramedics met the aircraft at the gate upon arrival and received medical attention.

Shortly after leveling and approaching the POM VOR and making the turn on the SID towards terrain; we received an RA to descend due to the VFR traffic over the POM VOR; which had us descending towards terrain.Instead of SoCal flying us directly into traffic over the POM VOR; SoCal should have provided us with a heading to give us terrain and traffic avoidance. [They] gave us neither. If it is a necessity the VFR aircraft operate over the POM VOR; since the SID is at or below 8;000; the VFR traffic needs to be at or above 9;000.

At first I did not notice anything. Then a minute later I commented on a musty smell. It did not seem significant at that time; then the First Officer commented that she thought it was getting worse. I could now smell what she did; kind of like a light maintenance oily garage smell. At about 9;000 ft I called the cabin and asked if there were any odors or fumes in the cabin. The answer was negative. There were no vapors or smoke and aircraft systems indicated everything normal. I did not realize that the fumes were concentrated at the First Officer position on the Flight Deck. With only about 10 minutes to landing and on an intercept to Localizer I elected to focus on the approach and landing. At this point I still did not think the event was significant. After landing during taxi to the gate the fumes were noticeably stronger and the First Officer requested to open her window for some fresh air. Maintenance was called out and after doing the parking checklist I debriefed the mechanic and filled out the [maintenance log]. At this time I started to notice an oily taste in my mouth. Departing the jet bridge the First Officer commented that she did not feel right and we decided to call [my union] for guidance. While filling out the Smoke; Odor; and Fumes Report form I began to have symptoms similar to the First Officer. The oily taste; nasal and throat irritation along with a slight headache. We decided to call off the trip and seek medical for a checkup. [Operations Control] along with the [Maintenance Control] were notified. We were seen at the Urgent Care [in the airport]. We both had elevated blood pressure and elevated levels of Carbon Monoxide. Chest X-rays were taken. After treatment of 30 minutes on Oxygen another Blood Draw was accomplished and CO (Carbon Monoxide) levels had come down. We were released and deadheaded home.

We complied and I communicated this to ATC. The DC-3 passed above and behind us.When ATC made the call on traffic to us; we were able to acquire it visually. I'm not sure why ATC stopped giving us advisories unless the radar sweep was slow and he was not able to see the traffic turn into us. The TCAS (great tool) provided us backup to what we both could already see was about to happen if we did not intervene our flightpath. Later via a phone conversation with the Captain; the ATC supervisor said the Controller thought we were responsible for separation because we called traffic in sight.If in doubt; communicate early with ATC about your intentions or clarify your concerns about who is responsible for separation. When all else fails; rely on your training (back to the basics)...TCAS TA/RA procedures; traffic avoidance; etc. Also; this is a good reminder for us all in the cockpit of how important visual lookout is in all environments and the techniques we have (automation/autopilot) that allow us to maintain situational awareness while we look for potential threats.",,,,"A319 First Officer reported an airborne conflict during the climb out after reporting traffic in sight to ATC.",

She asked me if we were doing any turns or climbs or descents because she and a few other flight attendants were feeling dizzy and nauseous. I told her no; we had been in straight and level flight for the last two hours. I told her I'll try to increase the air quality in the cabin; so I turned off the Right Recirculating Fan. I also asked her if she or any of the other flight attendants smelled anything strange; like wet dirty socks. We also checked the cabin altitude to make sure that the cabin was not climbing. It was stable at around 8500 ft; and made sure there were no Ozone areas in the [weather] map. A few minutes later; [the Flight Attendant] contacted me again to let me know the flight attendants were getting worse; both the ones in the front of the airplane and in the back. That they were almost incapacitated. I asked her to wake up our IRO (International Relief Officer); and immediately contacted Dispatch through SATCOM and requested a patch with Medlink.[The First Officer] went through the entire cabin and could not smell any fumes or anything unusual. But he did say some flight attendants looked ill. One of them reported blurred; narrow vision; another had teary eyes and was sweating. I had the Purser come to the cockpit to listen what [to] the doctor had to say; as we went through the symptoms. The doctor recommended that some; but not all of the flight attendants take a medication called Diphenhydramine to counter the symptoms. And he also recommended that we land as soon as possible. As a side note; the medication was NOT in the med kit the doctor said it should be. It was in the cockpit med kit. So his information needs to be updated/corrected.The decision was made to return to [the departure airport] because they have excellent medical facilities; longer runways; and some of the passengers originated from there. It was about a two hour flight to return from that point; and we were still looking at an overweight landing. We requested a turn back for medical reasons. We got immediate priority without requesting it.I had [the Purser] pass her Purser duties to [another flight attendant]; and directed that her and 2 other flight attendants with the worst symptoms take the pills. That gave us a minimum crew of 5 FAs (Flight Attendants). We checked their status every 10 minutes; and told them to let us know ASAP if they got worse; in case we needed to divert somewhere closer. Most of them reported feeling better; especially after taking oxygen. They did measure their oxygen levels with the oxygen meter in the quick response kit. Initially; their O2 levels were unusually low; in the mid-80s.We asked ATC for lower altitudes for two reasons; lower cabin altitude; and higher fuel burn because we were projecting an overweight landing. On the way; we reviewed the Smoke and Fumes Elimination; Ozone; Bio Hazard and Overweight checklists. Only the Overweight Landing checklist could apply. We did have an overweight landing (+/-4;000 lbs). That was necessary due to the nature of the emergency; we could not remain in the air longer to burn more fuel. Autobrakes disconnected on landing and manual braking was required. The left main gear temperatures were reading 4s by the time we exited [the runway]. [It was] a short taxi to the remote parking stand; and it took a few minutes for the ground personnel to install wheel chocks. By then; the left main landing gear temperatures had climbed to 9s. The left rear tire fuse melted and the tire deflated. Fire department; medical and mechanic personnel met the airplane and took care of the situation from there.Flight attendants and some passengers were taken to the airport clinic. They felt OK and released shortly after. We found out next day that all flight attendants tested positive for CO2.

We taxied out single engine; then as we were in line to take off I started the #2 engine and we completed the before takeoff checklist. While sitting in line; the wind was blowing so hard the aircraft was being jolted around and the Captain suggested that we use TOGA thrust instead of FLEX thrust for takeoff. I asked him if he wanted me to force flaps 2; and he said see what the box gives us and we will just use the TOGA numbers. I requested new takeoff data but it did not come in time. We had already put in the TOGA numbers from the data we had so that is what we used. We were cleared onto the runway; so the Captain began taxiing. Before we made the turn onto center line the controller cleared us for takeoff.As the Captain made the turn he added power and the aircraft began skidding toward the right side of the runway. The Captain brought the thrust back and deployed the thrust reversers; but we continued to skid toward the edge of the runway. I believe he stomped on the left rudder and began to bring the aircraft back to the left. When I realized we were not going into the grass and he had the airplane under control; I told the passengers to remain seated and notified ATC we had aborted. We then taxied clear of the runway. As we cleared the runway another aircraft said that we had hit a runway edge light. The Captain said the airplane seemed to be taxiing fine so we decided to taxi it back to the gate. I grabbed the rejected takeoff checklist; ran through it; and then told Ground we wanted to go back to the gate. They gave us instructions; then I called operations for a gate assignment. As we taxied back I did the after landing flows. We got to the gate without incident and maintenance met us there.

We noticed the FOB (Fuel on Board) was decreasing below 7.0. The winds were higher than forecast so we didn't think much of it. We did decide to climb ahead of schedule since the winds were no worse higher in an attempt to get back on our burn schedule. Upon reaching [the midpoint of the flight] FOB had decreased significantly more; around 4.5 if I remember correctly. This is when we first became concerned that we may need to do a fuel stop if the winds did not subside and the burn trend reverse. We texted dispatch with our FOB and concern. I noticed an 800lb fuel imbalance so I did a cross feed while waiting to hear back from dispatch. Dispatch said he was showing us crossing the fixes +/- 200 lbs. After a couple more exchanges with dispatch the FOB had dropped to 3.5. We did a FMC position report; dispatch was showing the same thing +/- 200 lbs. The fuel had become imbalanced again so we started looking at alternative explanations than un-forecasted winds. As the FOB dropped to 3.0 we decided we were going to have to fuel stop at a minimum. Meanwhile Dispatch had sent us a flight plan to [an alternate] if we wanted to; but his info was still showing we were on plan. We had 16.5 FOB at this time so we did not feel pressure to act rashly. We looked at options and tried to explain the discrepancy. We did the fuel leak check list and it appeared that we had enough symptoms to confirm that we had a probable leak. We had plenty of fuel so we decided it was not prudent to create another emergency by shutting down #2 engine. We discussed when we would continue check list and shut it down. We determined 2000 lbs in # 2 tank as our bottom line for shut down. At the same time as discussions and checklist were ongoing we started the divert.We did a normal landing [at the alternate] with both engines running. We had Fire department check for visible signs of leak. The said #2 was leaking. We shut it down on the taxiway and confirmed the leak had stopped prior to proceeding to gate.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"Boeing 737 flight crew reported a fuel burn in excess of that expected for the flight.

I asked them to clean up the cabin early so as to be done and seated prior to the choppy air at the lower altitudes. Just a few seconds later; my First Officer (FO) said that he would like to use the lavatory prior to landing. We also had a Company Captain Observer on the jump seat; and he expressed interest in doing the same. My FO went first and returned promptly then the Observer left. As I recall we were given a descent clearance to FL 350 as the FO initiated the descent; the Observer called to come back to the flight deck. I got up from my seat to check the door viewer and open the door and as I returned to my seat we started to get some vibration or bumps. Within a few seconds the Flight Attendants called to ask about the noise and vibration.As I was explaining to them we were entering some chop; I noticed that the autothrottle had disconnected and the #2 engine was rolling back. I tried to move the thrust lever but had no response. After realizing what we were dealing with I set CONT thrust in the FMC and found the single engine drift down speed. I immediately asked ATC for a lower altitude. I told the FO to continue to fly the aircraft while I got out the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist. As I was going to the QRH; I re-assessed the situation and felt that the Engine Fire/Severe Damage Checklist may be more appropriate because of the engine vibration we felt (Nothing abnormal on the AVI.)  As we performed the checklist and shutdown the engine; the vibration stopped. At that point we also had the 'ENG FAIL' annunciation. We never had a fire or overheat light. Our Flight Deck Observer was extremely helpful in helping me with communication to Dispatch; Flight Attendants and the Passengers.I had initially told ATC that most likely we would land at ZZZ (landing alternate for our destination.)  We were given a direct clearance to ZZZ airport. However; after attaining the weather for both ZZZ and zZZ1 I felt that in the interest of Safety that ZZZ1 would be a better option as both were approximately the same distance. My concerns for landing at ZZZ were turbulence; moderate icing on descent and gusty crosswinds on the long runway or a much shorter runway with favorable winds. My concern was I knew we would have additional speed with a flap 15 (ice) landing with a fairly heavy weight landing of about 127;500 pounds. The decision was made to land at ZZZ1 with overcast skies no ice and a smooth ride with light winds straight down a 12;000 ft runway. After all appropriate checklists; briefings and calls were made I assumed control of the aircraft and we landed at ZZZ1 without further incident. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) met us after landing and I stopped the aircraft on the taxiway after we cleared the runway. I wanted CFR to assess any potential visual damage prior to proceeding to the gate. No apparent damage was noted so we continued to Gate. Upon reaching the gate we advised the Passengers that Customer Service Agents would help accommodate them to their destinations. I then called Dispatch and spoke to all of the appropriate channels to debrief the incident. This included Dispatch; Maintenance and the Chief Pilot on Call. I entered a defect noting the #2 engine failure in the aircraft logbook. I then conducted an outside walk around the aircraft in particular looking at the #2 engine. Both the Contract Mechanic and I did not notice anything unusual or apparently abnormal with the engine.  However; we did have a red EGT exceedance annunciation on the ground. The highest observed EGT was 788 in flight prior to shut down. The aircraft was shut down except for overnight gate services accommodations.",,,,"A B737 Captain reported an engine rollback at cruise requiring a diversion and emergency landing.",

After performing a gate return for an engine valve issue and subsequent MEL we had a normal take off. Climbing through 6;000 feet we heard a very loud air noise; which we initially thought was rain/weather. No weather was present so I was tasked to check the cabin in case we had a door come open or something similar but the noise was present mainly in the cockpit. This was later determined to possibly be a blown duct. After the noise occurred we checked the status page and we had a landing gear monitor message. At the same time; the Maintenance person that [the Company] had tasked to ride with us had a specific piece of equipment to monitor the O2 content in the aircraft. As we leveled at 13;000 feet his monitor started making an audible alarm and noticeable flash and when I saw the screen I could see that the O2 content was not normal. We now had three issues occurring at the same time that we felt necessitated an air return which also was going to include an overweight landing in ZZZZ. As the Relief Officer (IRO) I looked up the overweight landing checklist and attempted to run it but there was some confusion among the three of us as to exactly how to run that checklist. It kept referring me to the performance section for the correct chart and for some reason I found that chart exceptionally difficult to understand. That checklist is somewhat confusing I think in the heat of battle. What was great was the ability of the iPad to remember what page I was on in the checklist and also to be able to 'hotlink' me to the correct sections and move back and forth - that feature is fabulous. I had to prompt the crew several times that we needed to run this overweight landing checklist which also contains the approach descent and landing checklists. The captain had his hands full flying the heavy aircraft and getting it properly slowed down and configured. The margins were very narrow on the speed tape. There was also some discussion of trying to 'document' what was happening which I eventually had to express very forcefully that the focus should be on flying the aircraft first. That was a definite threat which in a different scenario could have been very dangerous. With a heavy; slow plane like that; one person should have been totally focused on flying and at times that focus appeared to be wandering slightly. After we were able to get all the checklists ran we made a normal VFR approach and landing the slightly longer runway. ZZZZ had to suspend takeoffs for us I believe for us to land.",,"[Report narrative contains no additinal information.]",,"A B767 flight crew reported returning to land due to several indications of malfunctions on the aircraft.",

I realized upon the go around I had rushed the whole event. Entering the yellow border in red resource management. My FO did a wonderful job help bring us into the green. My future goal is not to rush to comply but to sit back; assess; and proceed.",,"Shortly after departure; the cabin called and reported smoke and fumes in the aft section. We [advised] ATC. I expeditiously got new weather; runway landing analysis (for overweight landing); called ops to report situation and return. I became concerned about the overweight landing; as lower braking action areas of the landing data were over the runway length; and it had been raining when we took off. Runway braking action was reported good; and we were vectored in for a tight ILS. On the glide slope; at flaps 3; the Captain went to managed speed. The aircraft selected 250 knots; and attempted to accelerate while descending on the glide slope; causing a 6 knot overspeed. After a few seconds; a go around was executed. Cabin stated that the smoke had dissipated. Took vectors for a less rushed approach and (overweight) landing without further incident. Crash crew visually inspected the aircraft on the runway. After they found nothing; they escorted the aircraft to the gate. Aircraft was deplaned; and the flight was later canceled by maintenance.Due to the initial perceived urgency to get the aircraft on the ground; the first approach was very rushed. They Captain was flying; making PAs and talking on the radio; while I was talking to ops; backing up his flying; and gathering the information we needed to set up for the landing. The one thing we forgot to do was 'activate and confirm' to put the aircraft in approach mode. This is normally backed up by the geographical point where the box automatically enters approach mode. However; I would guess that the short approach had us bypass this point. This caused the aircraft to command acceleration on a descent; when we were heavy. The flaps were oversped. The Captain waited a few moments; hoping he could 'save' the approach. I stated we had to go around. After a few seconds; he executed the go around. There was probably no need to rush as much as we did. That being said; we still might have forgotten to 'activate and confirm' as there is no trigger or checklist to do so in this scenario. One must simply remember. We both forgot; and we set up no barriers as the threat did not occur to us. Perhaps a procedural change to confirm approach mode before selecting managed speed might prevent this.",,"A321 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after Flight Attendants reported smoke in the cabin.

Immediately after rotation; we both noticed an odor in the cockpit that smelled like a mixture of burning electrical and burning oil/hydraulic fluid. Initially; we thought it may have been residual [De-ice]/anti ice fluid; as the aircraft was towed in from another location; (we had not accepted our first aircraft due to maintenance issues). We determined after a brief discussion that the aircraft had not needed deicing; and the smell must be coming from elsewhere. It was not dissipating.After cleanup and reaching a safe altitude; we briefly discussed the smell; which was not dissipating. I felt slightly light headed; and I was getting a dry; tingling feeling in the back of my throat. I recognized these from my military altitude chamber hypoxia symptoms; and informed [the] Captain of my condition. As PF; I immediately donned my oxygen mask while [the] Captain got into the QRH; ran the checklists; and tried to coordinate with Flight attendants (FA's) to see if they could smell the odor as well. The FA's informed us that they could smell it; and it was getting more potent. [The] Captain Notified ATC of [our issue] and coordinated a return. After a few minutes; I was noticing the Captain having difficulty with basic FMS functions and told him he should immediately don his mask; as I feared he was also experiencing signs of hypoxia. After donning his mask; he was able to return to normal; and we worked in tandem to get the aircraft turned around and back to the departure airport.I flew and talked on the radio; and the Captain manipulated the FMS and checklists. We received a single frequency approach controller; and flew an ILS to the runway; with an overweight landing of approximately 163;000 lbs with a light touchdown and stopped on the runway while the emergency responding vehicles inspected our aircraft. Once given the all clear; we taxied back to the gate; remaining on oxygen the entire time until engines were shut down. We opened the flight deck windows for ventilation after we parked; and removed our masks.

We continued down to 10;000 feet MSL and diverted to an Airport which was about 200 NM away. We were VFR the whole time. Next; we realized we would be overweight or have to hold at the Airport. We talked to the Flight Attendants to brief and check on them and the Passengers. They said a few Passengers were complaining about their ears and some felt light headed.

We observed the cabin altitude continuing to very slowly increase (to about 10;800) and decided to continue to descend and see if the trend would reverse. Within a minute or so; and around FL260; it did. We continued down to 10;000 feet at which point the cabin descended to about 5000 feet. I kept the cabin about 5000 feet until we descended further for landing. We had a discussion on deploying the Passenger Oxygen masks; as stated in the 'Uncontrollable' decision tree. We both agreed that doing so would cause unnecessary panic due to the problem appearing to be 'Controllable.'

At least; until about half way across the country. On my audio panel; I had the cabin inter-phone volume up; and overheard the Flight Attendants discussing a medical issue with a passenger who was laying on the back galley floor due to low blood pressure and feeling faint. When the number 1 (Flight Attendant) called me; she said that they had made an announcement for a doctor on board; and there was one who was attending to the woman; and also it appeared that she would be 'okay'.I requested that they make a call to the Physician on Call (POC) using their Wi-Fi phone; and gave them the desk number. At that point; I also decided to contact dispatch and get them in the loop. We discussed using ZZZ if a medical diversion was required. Dispatch said the Flight Attendants were talking to the POC and agreed on our diversion choices if needed. First Officer and I called up the weather; ATIS (ZZZ); reviewed the Jeppesen; and calculated our landing distances. ZZZ would be right on the line. It was very fortuitous that we did all this pre-planning; because about 20 minutes later we had to put that plan into action.All of a sudden; there was a muffled bang sound; followed by a loud whirling continuous noise like an electric motor that was failing. At the same time; there was also a small vibration that reminded me of a radar antenna motor going bad; so I immediately switched the unit off. That wasn't the problem. Next; our number 1 Flight Attendant called and said she heard a large bang by the one Right (1R) door. After she hung up; First Officer and I both thought we had a possible aircraft structural problem that may cause a rapid decompression; and we asked for a lower altitude of 14;000 feet. At this point; we knew we probably weren't going to destination.Now the noise was accompanied by an acrid electrical smell. I said let's get on oxygen and get into the smoke and fumes checklist. I handed the aircraft over to the First Officer and said tell them we want to divert to ZZZ. The number 1 called to say she smelled smoke; however when I tried to communicate with her through the oxygen mask microphone; she could not understand what I was saying. There was a loud feedback squeal in the speaker when I transmitted; and further complicating the situation; she could not understand what was being said from the poor quality of the oxygen mask microphone. After several attempts with the speaker causing a large feedback squeal; I took the mask off long enough to tell her to prepare for a landing and do a '30 second review;' I also made a quick announcement to the passengers to return to their seats; and I turned the seatbelt sign back on. It was at this time I noticed that the smoke abated but the loud humming noise continued. With the smoke subsiding; I discontinued the Smoke/Fumes Checklist after the first couple of steps. In hindsight; I should have continued beyond step 2 in the checklist; but the lack of communication distraction took me out of it until it was no longer needed.We removed our oxygen masks; briefed the approach; ran the Emergency Landing Checklist; and discussed the situation and our threats to the remainder of the flight. With the situation a little better at hand; I 'all called' the Flight Attendants and gave them a proper briefing; and said we were expecting a normal landing and taxi to the gate. I made a better; more detailed Public Address to the passengers and explained that I requested EMS to be on hand so expect to see some 'flashing lights!' We agreed that we would shoot the ZZZ ILS and leave it on the autopilot; in case the smoke started back up again. Fortunately; it did not and we successfully shot the approach; and I disconnected the Autopilot at 500 feet and got probably the smoothest landing.Once at taxi speed I made a 'remain seated 3x Public Address' and we continued to [the] gate; and deplaned using the Jetway uneventfully. Shortly after shut down while debriefing maintenance; the motor whirring noise got louder and the acrid electronics odor returned. Next; we got an ECAM 'AVIONICS SMOKE' message. I followed the QRH 'IMMEDIATE ACTION' checklist and shortly thereafter; the noise stopped; but only after the 'AV/VENT EXTRACT FAN'; circuit breaker (AC 4) popped. That concluded the evening's excitement!One final thought; First Officer related an Oxygen Mask communications procedure from a previous airline; where they would put their headsets over the oxygen mask and turn the speakers off; hence no feedback problems! I use a molded ear-piece and believe that would also work. The current procedure with the microphone/speaker feedback is unsafe and completely unacceptable!",,,,"A321 Captain reported diverting due to in-flight smoke and fumes from an apparent electrical problem followed by difficulties communicating through the oxygen masks.",

I asked him if there was any smoke or fumes and he replied there were no issues. I told him not to reset the Circuit Breaker (CB) and asked him to call me back if anything changed. Shortly after that as we were nearing FL300 he called back and reported a very strange and strong smell in the aft cabin and that the oven was extremely hot. No visible smoke or fire was reported; but the First Officer (FO) and I began to smell something similar to the smell of burning rubber in the cockpit. At that time we completed the memory items for the Smoke/Fumes checklist and notified Center that we and wanted to divert approximately off our nose. I let the FA's know we were diverting and would be on the ground in about 10 minutes and to prepare for a normal landing. I also informed the passengers that we would be going to [divert] due to a mechanical issue.During the descent the FO sent a message to dispatch; communicated with ATC and we reprogrammed our destination to [diversion airport]. I kept the speed above 250 below 10;000 in order to get the aircraft down to pattern altitude as well as the the concern that there may be a fire that wasn't apparently visible. We completed most of the Smoke/Fumes checklist as we were approaching the airport. I checked with the FA in back and verified no change in status in the cabin.On final I pushed for Managed Speed but we had missed activating the approach phase and the aircraft briefly accelerated to approximately 3 knots above the limit for flaps one. The remainder of the approach was normal with a normal landing about 1;000 pounds over max landing weight. After landing we cleared the runway and I verified with our FA that there was still no smoke or fire and got a confirmation from the fire rescue truck that all appeared OK. We taxied to the gate and when we opened the cockpit door there was a very strong odor in the cabin. Fire rescue boarded the aircraft and confirmed via thermal sensor that the malfunctioning oven was still very warm (250 degrees) and at least 150 degrees warmer than the other oven.This was a very time compressed event as the time from the top of descent to landing was probably no more than 10-12 min. with many tasks to accomplish in a very short time. Overall I feel we did a good job based on the information with only one or two minor mistakes during the event.",,,,"A319 Captain reported that during the climbout it was discovered that a circuit breaker had opened in in the aft galley; accompanied by strong fumes a few minutes later.

Controller was quite enthusiastic about the amount of smoke and that it was only the right engine affected. Our engine instruments showed normal but we asked for vectors for a downwind to assess situation. As we were getting vectors we attempted to reach Dispatch/Maintenance via SATCOM but were unable to contact. We had our Flight Attendants do a visual assessment out the windows and they reported no smoke that they could see. We asked for an approach to ZZZ so that our maintenance and/or the Fire Department could assess if there was excessive smoke from the right engine. After the approach the tower again reiterated very excessive smoke from the right engine on climb out.At this time we were finally able to contact Dispatch and Maintenance who said there was no excessive oil consumption and that he couldn't detect any abnormalities with either engine. We discussed that the excessive smoke seemed to be when the engines were at a higher power setting. By the time we conferred with Maintenance we informed Dispatch that we only had about 84;000 lbs of fuel and were concerned that it was well below our MINTO of 88.8. We were also planned well south of the normal routes due to weather and rides. We felt that the best decision was to return to ZZZ to refuel and at the same time we could have Maintenance do an inspection of the engine as well. It was decided we would dump fuel to our max landing weight and return to ZZZ.We informed ATC that we needed to dump fuel and were told to hold at ZZZZZat 5;000 feet. At XA48Z with the fuel at 82;200 lbs we initiated the Fuel Jettison Procedure. Shortly after initiating the fuel jettison we received a Fuel Jettison Main EICAS telling us that the right main fuel jettison had malfunctioned. We discontinued dumping at this point as per the Fuel Jettison Main checklist at XA53 with 72;000 lbs of fuel remaining. We contacted Maintenance again and informed him of the jettison malfunction and that we would be doing an overweight landing at ZZZ.ATC and the company were informed of our return and we requested the fire trucks nearby for our landing. We did a 30 flaps landing at approximately 472;000 lbs to a very smooth touchdown.Maintenance inspected the engine and determined that the engine intermix probably played a large part in the concern from ATC on our takeoff because the left engine was relatively new and the right was considerably older. The mechanic also said he noted the excessive smoke in the right engine vs. the left but didn't feel that it was any more than a normal amount. The engine was inspected with no findings of problems; the overweight landing inspection was completed; and a new flight plan was filed with an MEL item of the right main fuel jettison inop. I contacted the flight operations as soon as we returned to the gate to report our incident and airport return and informed them that the crew was ready to go as soon as the proper maintenance and paperwork were done. We received the new release and flight plan release and left the gate as soon as we had everything.On taxi-out the tower controller asked what we found out about the right engine and proceeded to again express how highly alarmed he was by the amount of smoke on takeoff. We explained to him why there was such a difference between the engines due to the intermix and thanked him for his vigilance and concern. The flight to ZZZ1 was completed without further incident.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B777 flight crew reported being advised by the Tower of excessive smoke coming from an engine during takeoff and returned to land overweight.",

I [informed ATC of our situation] and told them we want to divert.

But I feel [the airline] could drastically improve training to handle these events. Communicating with the Captain while wearing the oxygen mask was difficult; and it was nearly impossible for him to communicate with the flight attendants. When discussing the ABC's of Threat and Error Management we are trained to communicate all threats and intentions. We were able to accomplish our tasks with a successful outcome; but it could have been much easier without the confusion from hindered communication.Before I came to [this airline]; I spent 8 years in the training department at [another airline]. In addition to supervising all Line and Simulator Check Airmen I was responsible for all of our training curriculum. I was contacted by a Captain who had a smoke event shortly after takeoff. At the time we trained to don the oxygen masks; turn on the intercom; and turn on the speaker. This resulted in both pilots hearing each other breathing through the masks over the speakers. The Captain of the flight said it was nearly impossible to communicate with the First Officer and Air Traffic Control. We changed our procedures and produced a video that was shown during all initial; upgrade; and recurrent simulator training. After donning the oxygen masks we trained to put on your headset and use the intercom only when communicating with the other pilot to reduce feedback and background noise.I understand the company has agreed to revisit the SMOKE/FUMES procedures. I feel the immediate actions for smoke/avionics smoke/fumes could be improved. I think the communication issue could be solved by training to put on your headset after the oxygen masks are on. I would add something along the lines of crew communication: establish to the Immediate Action checklist and even consider making the first 2-3 steps memory items. I would train these procedures during all initial and upgrade training and then revisit them annually.",,,,"A319 First Officer reported a muffled bang sound; followed by smoke in the cabin and difficulty communicating through the crew oxygen masks.",

The flight attendants told me that the smell got worse towards the aft galley. They had initial concerns there might be a problem with an engine so they had run forward to look out the windows and saw nothing abnormal. We immediately asked for a level off from ATC while we looked into the problem. We leveled off at 13;000 feet. The Captain decided I should go aft and take a look so we coordinated for a flight attendant to come forward while I went aft to investigate. When I reached the aft half of the cabin; I did smell a slight odor that smelled more like exhaust than burning rubber to me; but it was very slight and barely noticeable. I did not see any smoke or haze. When I asked the flight attendants if they saw any smoke or haze they initially said no. I also asked them if they were feeling OK and they said yes. I then went back to the cockpit and told the Captain what I had seen and heard. Our initial thoughts were about the tires since the smell was like burning rubber and we didn't feel like there was any issue about the tires. Since the smell had almost completely dissipated; we were heavyweight; and there was no one claiming any effects; we initially elected to press on to destination; but would continue to monitor the situation. Almost immediately after the Captain talked with the flight attendants again; two of the flight attendants (#3 and #4) told the Captain they were feeling dizzy and light-headed. We immediately decided we needed to [advise ATC] and return to [the departure airport]. We had the flight attendants query the passengers and we initially determined 8 passengers were claiming they felt ill. We did not smell anything on the flight deck; but we decided I should don my mask as a precaution. The Captain flew an uneventful visual approach and uneventful overweight (approximately 154;000 lb) landing and we taxied to the hold bay for Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to inspect the aircraft. ARFF did not note any damage after inspection. Although ARFF was prepared to get airstairs and have EMTs board to check the passengers who were feeling ill. However; when we checked again; only the two flight attendants were feeling ill so ARFF asked us to taxi back to the gate. We taxied to the gate and EMS checked the two flight attendants and we deplaned the passengers. Although the two flight attendants later reported they felt ok; they were pulled off of the trip. After block-in; I did a post-flight walk around and did not see anything out of the ordinary. We did fill out an online smoke; fume; and odor form and submitted it online. My understanding after talking with management is that a cabin recirculation fan had failed and a circuit breaker had popped and that was the reason for the smell of burning rubber. We did not know this at the time though. We need a better checklist for handling smoke; fumes; or odors as the current QRH seems to be all about eliminating smoke from a possible fire. Although we referenced it; I felt it was inadequate in determining what type of odor was occurring or how to respond appropriately in this situation.",,,,"B737 First Officer reported that there was a smell of burning rubber in the cabin prompting a return to the departure airport.",

I was First Officer flying in the right seat; IRO was Pilot Monitoring (PM); and Captain was on break. There was a bang and the aircraft yawed to the left. N1 and N2 on the left side were decreasing. I announced 'Engine Failure'; disconnected the Autothrottles and Autopilot; and assumed positive aircraft control. I then confirmed it was the left side with the PM and retarded the left thrust lever to idle. I called for the QRH and asked the IRO to identify as an emergency and request lower (Engine Out altitude was FL 230). We would eventually descend to FL 200.During the drift down; we started the QRH and when it got to the part about restart; we discussed our options. Left N1 was 25%; Left N2 was around 26%; fuel flow was .6; Vibration (VIB) was normal; oil quantity was normal. The abnormal indications were that EPR was blank; Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) was rising into the red (it would eventually peak at 1002); and oil pressure was decreasing and in the red.We had asked for a heading to ZZZZ during the initial drift down. My thought process was that I was very familiar with the facilities at ZZZZ and if we somehow were able to get the engine restarted; I would prefer that. It also pointed us in the same general direction as ZZZZ1; so it didn't cost us anything by heading that way.During the restart discussion; the cabin call chime rang and the Captain was at the door. She took her seat and we caught her up on the situation. We transferred aircraft control and continued the discussion about restart. The Left Autopilot was engaged and then there were two rapid engine surges and she directed us to continue the QRH as all thoughts of a restart were discarded. The IRO read the QRH while I (PM) performed the steps. We all confirmed irreversible actions (fuel control and Fire Handle). At this point we had leveled off at FL 200 and decided that ZZZZ1 was the nearest suitable field (Weather was VFR with light winds and was provided by ATC). Checklist was completed up to the deferred items for the landing checklist. ZZZZ1 was about 160 NM away by this point.We then transferred aircraft control and the Captain gave the briefing to the Flight Attendants and made a Public Address (PA) to the passengers. While she was doing that I coordinated the divert with ATC; passed them the Souls on Board and fuel and notified Dispatch. Dispatch had previously gotten word somehow that we were an emergency and sent us a message; but I hadn't had time to respond. Once the Captain was done with her PA. She assumed aircraft control and asked us if there was anything else we needed to be thinking; or if could think of anything we may have missed. We then flew a southeast visual to the Runway; backed up by the LOC; exited the runway at the end and were inspected by CFR (Crash Fire Rescue). Nothing critical being discovered; we taxied to the ramp and did the parking checklist. Once the air stairs were in place we talked the CFR chief and terminated the emergency with ground.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B767 flight crew reported an engine failure in cruise followed by a diversion to the nearest suitable airfield.",

ATC initiated a missed approach using improper phraseology then [said it] correctly the second time; during which we went to Control Wheel Steering (CWS) mode when; coincidentally; the LOC GS and FD blanked on both sides of the aircraft on autopilot A. We successfully completed the go around and returned to autopilot A as the navigation equipment came back and identified after reset.The approach that followed had the exact same blanking of all NAV data at 500 until the ground; this time hand flying and under visual conditions. We queried ATC and were the only ones who reported an issue. We wrote up the LOC GS sensing in the Electronic Logbook (ELB) and switched aircraft. I followed up [later] and it appeared my write up was released under MEL for the autopilot A; which never failed or was written up by us. I called Maintenance Control to query him on the decision and he agreed it did not sound like an autopilot issue based on my write up and our conversation. I also briefed the crew on the issue on our arrival to ORD. The maintenance controller said he would follow up with an inflight uplink to make the crew aware.My concern rested with the; in my opinion; incorrect diagnosis and remedy to the approach navaid sensing issue; and the repeated issue occurring in the future if it happened to another crew during another similar situation on approach low to the terrain.

Soon after; we were given best rate through 12;000. Upon passing 10;000; I set a speed restriction of 250/12000 in FMC; selected Econ; and due to the 120-cost index; per the Release; lowered the climb speed to 320kts from 335kts. Eventually we were given a climb to somewhere in the upper 20s. Next came a clearance to climb to a higher altitude in the lower 30s. At around 27;000ft; I noticed the autopilot starting to chase the speed and was doing small vertical oscillations in the attempt. I made a comment to my First Office (FO) about the autopilot having issues. Knowing the 737 has a few issues with VNAV; it wasn't anything more than slightly unusual at this time. These oscillations continued to get more extreme. I told FO that I was going to switch the Vertical mode from VNAV to FLCH (Flight Level Change). After doing this; the oscillations didn't get any better. I then told him I was going to try V/S; assuming if I could get the aircraft to stop chasing the speed the oscillations would go away. With no relief in sight; I then told FO; 'I can't take this anymore; I'm turning the autopilot off;' expecting full well for everything to be fine and blaming the whole thing on a quirky autopilot. As soon as I turned the autopilot off; I discovered that I could barely move the yoke forward and back. As FO would later say; it was like pushing the yoke through wet; soon to be dry; concrete. At first I thought; this can't be; it must be me. I told him I can't move the elevator; you try. He couldn't move it with any effectiveness either. With further force; and being as gentle as we could; we could move it; but with minimal effect. It felt like manual reversion in the simulators that I have done many times; but with slightly less effect. At this point; I checked the roll and yaw axis and everything felt normal. I didn't push the rudder too much either way; as I wasn't sure what was going on with the tail on this airplane. We also determined that the stabilizer trim was working as normal; which became our primary way to control our vertical axis. As soon as we determined we had this flight control issue; we notified ATC as an emergency. We were equal distance from ZZZ and ZZZ1; with ZZZ1 being on the nose and ZZZ behind us. We asked ATC what the runway length and winds were in ZZZ1. Knowing that ZZZ1 would have big; long; and wide runways. ATC informed us that the runway that lined up with the 8kt wind was over 12000ft. We informed ATC that's where we wanted to go. During this entire time; we never had any indication of anything being wrong with the aircraft except from physically struggling to move the elevator. Hydraulic quantity and pressure were normal. I then asked FO to find me a checklist in the QRH that had something to do with what was going on. The only checklist he could find was the manual reversion checklist; which related to hydraulic pressure or quantity loss. I asked him to look at every flight control cover and switch and make sure they were all in their normal positions. He assured me everything was where it should be. We then inquired as to the winds in ZZZ as I knew it would be much easier to handle the passengers. ATC advised us that the winds were gusting up to 30kts. ZZZ1 was our final decision. At this time; I asked FO to talk to the flight attendants and inform them of our situation. I asked him to give them the full briefing and prepare for possible evacuation on the runway. Soon after the event started; we slowly bleed off speed and descend. Not wanting to make any abrupt changes; we slowly reduced the speed to 250kts. I noticed as the speed decreased we would gain a little bit of elevator authority. I asked FO to take the aircraft while I made a short Public Address to the passengers. After taking controls back; I asked FO to ask ATC to notify the company as the 737 is not sat phone equipped; and making any attempt at this point to talk to company and maintenance would be a long process and I couldn't afford to be without the FO. We asked ATC for the ILS frequency and were informed that the 12000 ft. runway didn't have an ILS only the 9600 ft. runway. With only a 4 or 5kt crosswind; and very much needing vertical guidance; we decided to switch to runway 9600 ft. at ZZZ1. We then asked for the ILS frequency; course; and FAF name. We extended our centerline off the FAF to give us better situational awareness as we didn't have any charts to look at. It was daylight and 'clear and a million.' We informed ATC that we needed a 20-mile straight in to work through this problem. I wanted to check the aircraft state in every configuration and feel how it was responding at these different settings.The flight attendants called us back at some point and told us that the cabin was prepared. We relayed all pertinent information to ATC and requested Crew Fire Rescue to be standing by. There was not a whole lot of briefing the norms for FO and I as we had no approach charts and were committed to the landing. It was briefed that I may need him at anytime; and especially in the flare; to help with the flight controls. We were under landing weight and FO referenced the QRH landing data. We selected max brakes as a precaution. We received our long final and slowly configured the airplane. After each flap setting and subsequent speed reduction; the elevator became easier to use. It was based on this that I wanted to use a flaps 30 landing and a lack of familiarity with flaps 40 from reducing the speed further. After final configuration with flaps 30; I decided that I had enough elevator movement to make a safe landing without the need for the brace command. Upon reaching the flare; I asked FO to help me pull back as the flight controls were extremely heavy. We made a somewhat 'normal' touchdown based on the circumstances. Auto brakes kicked in and acted normal. As I disengaged the autobrakes at a slow speed; the brakes felt like they barely worked. I asked FO to feel them once when we had slowed to around 5kts and he agreed. We stopped the aircraft in the middle of [the] Runway. The fire chief did a visual inspection of the aircraft and gave us a thumbs up. Initially we were trying to coordinate a tow to the apron; but informed ATC we were going to try a very slow taxi and if we had any problems would need to be towed. We proceeded to taxi very slowly and check the brakes immediately to ensure their usability. We then taxied to a passenger area and parked the aircraft. Once at the gate; I made another brief Public Address and asked FO to please check on passengers and flight attendants. One extremely important note is that when we first got to the airplane; we were soon greeted by a mechanic asking us if everything was okay. We stated that we had just got there and hadn't had time to look around. He then noticed that the left hydraulic quantity was at 106 and the right at 80. He asked if we wanted him to transfer hydraulic fluid; we said sure. For 5 minutes; he was transferring without the left side going down at all but the right side was going up. I asked how that was possible and he said the gauge only goes to 106 and it was 'way over filled.' It took him over 10 minutes to balance the levels with the right ending up around 98 and the left around 100. It may be completely coincidental that a mechanic is working on our hydraulic system and an hour later; we have a major problem with the elevator. It almost felt like air was in the elevator hydraulic line instead of fluid.",,"Dispatcher's Computer showed flight diverting to ZZZ1; at 9000 feet. I called to confirm; and they advised flight had identified as an emergency with control problems- unable to control pitch. I received a 'call' from the flight; but they never responded to my radio call (they were at approximately 3800 feet; south of ZZZ1 at that time; turning towards the north to land).

With no warning; the engine rumbled for a couple of seconds with an obvious felt vibration and then after a slight pop the N1 of the right engine rolled back to around 30%. At the same time the EGT started to climb and would not respond to retarding the thrust lever. The EGT eventually reached 742 degrees before we could complete the Engine Fire/Severe Damage QRH. I elected to use that QRH due to the initial vibration and the temperature in the red zone. It was First Officer (FO) leg to fly and he assumed control of the aircraft immediately and smoothly; as well as taking the primary radio; while I began to run checklists and coordinate. ATC immediately offered [a diversion airport] as an option after we called in as an engine-out emergency. After running the checklist; securing the engine and beginning our driftdown; I began to attempt to contact company. I initially tried to call ops; but quickly realized we were too far away. My next choice was ARINC. At first I could get no response on the center VHF radio; so I shifted to the right radio. On that radio I was able to hear a long conversation in progress between Medlink and another aircraft. Not being able to contact dispatch; and having decided [the diversion airport] was near and suitable; I decided that managing the immediate situation was more important. We set up and briefed the approach during a long slow descent. We felt that rushing was not warranted; though we didn't waste time either. ATC was very helpful in coordinating the response from [emergency services] as well as facilitating our arrival to the airport. I tried one more time to contact company through ARINC to coordinate with dispatch but was unable to get a reply. Center then gave us vectors to the ILS and we shot the visual approach to 23L. During the vectors; I realized that ATC probably had a way of contacting Operations; and they said that they had an emergency number on our ATC strip. I agreed that would be the best number to call; and ATC came back and verified that company was aware of our situation and diversion.FO did a great job flying the airplane and at no time did I even remotely feel that I should take over flying. My time was best spent supporting him and coordinating with all the various parties involved. Also; our jumpseater was [another] Captain and even though we didn't need him to take an active part; I was very glad to have him along as an extra set of eyes and ears just in case. All in all; once we got settled down; training showed and the overall mood was surprisingly relaxed even though we were all undoubtedly thinking; 'I can't believe this just happened.'

I asked the Flight Attendant several questions to confirm that it was the glass outer pane that was damaged; and not the plastic inside pane. She confirmed that it was the glass pane that was cracked. I descended down to 27;000 feet because it was smoother air at 270; and this would also reduce the differential pressure.We remained pressurized during the entire event. We were near ZZZ; so we called ZZZ Operations to establish communication with Dispatch and Maintenance. Talking to Maintenance; he asked if I'd seen the damage.

On final approach to BUR Runway 8; with the gear down; ATC pointed out VFR traffic at our 2 o'clock position. I never saw the traffic that I believe was landing northbound at VNY. I don't remember the specific TCAS RA; but it required me to at least level off or climb. We executed the published missed approach. ATC offered us an approach to Runway 15; but I declined since we hadn't briefed it; and I know there are some terrain considerations that I didn't have time to fully consider and brief.After our checklists were complete for our second approach to Runway 8; I made a quick Public Address to our Customers. The next approach was a repeat of the first. This time; however; I know it was a 'Monitor Vertical Speed' requiring me to at least level off. Because the gear was down; we executed another missed approach. I will admit I really didn't want to execute the second missed approach as I considered the RA a nuisance alert; considering we knew where the traffic was and I know the First Officer had him in sight for the second approach (and I think the first as well). After the last RA ceased; I had complied with the RA vertical guidance; but hadn't commanded landing gear up yet. I was two-dots high and had some space to try to salvage the approach; but quickly decided this is the worst place to try to salvage a high approach; and executed another missed approach.There was no VNY traffic on our third approach. Dispatch had us planned to land with 11;000 pounds of fuel in BUR. I am very thankful we weren't planned to land with 5;000. Also; I would appreciate some clarification on the QRH's Response to other than a 'Monitor' or 'Maintain' (except a Climb RA in landing configuration) on page 1.9. We were not in flaps 40 configuration in either event; but the gear was down on both. Is landing configuration final flap setting; or gear down? Is a 'monitor vertical speed' that commands a level off considered a climb? Because we had excess fuel to work with; the missed approaches were clearly the least risk and I believe procedurally correct thing to do; but it certainly felt like a circus.","Reporter has received no feedback from his company pertaining to requested clarification of the intended meaning of the term 'Landing Configuration' as used in their TCAS RA procedures.",,,"B737 Captain reported receiving TCAS RAs while flying approaches to Runway 08 at BUR from northbound landing traffic at VNY.",

We noticed engine indications were in the normal range but oil quantity was lower than previous and oil pressure; while in normal range; was less than the right engine. The engine seemed to be operating well at that time.Got in touch with dispatch and asked if he could find out if Maintenance Control was able to see any down-linked engine events. Maybe that would show something irregular around the time of the witnessed event. They couldn't. We were then patched to Dispatch and Maintenance Control on Commercial Radio and verbally talked to them. We were advised by Maintenance Control that there was no low limit to oil quantity and it could go to ZERO but we didn't have to shut the engine down until oil pressure was at the 'magic number' of 13 PSI. We continued monitoring oil quantity and saw that it was slowly getting lower. The consensus was to continue on our route and monitor the engine.We had decided on a few alternate airports on our flight path to use as diversion airports should the time come that an engine shutdown was necessary. During this time we had been reviewing all pertinent procedures we would need if/when the engine needed to be shutdown while also discussing the situation in general.Approaching ZZZ it was becoming apparent that the rate of oil loss would not allow us to continue to ZZZ1. ZZZ2 was suggested but that was too far to be considered nearest suitable airport. It was decided that ZZZ would be our diversion airport as there was a plane available and closest to us with personnel there to assist. Flight attendants were briefed and passengers were made aware of the precautionary nature; at that time; of our diversion.FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying) at this time and made arrangements to go to ZZZ3 initially in a brief error in communication. I noticed this and we confirmed with the Dispatcher's message that ZZZ was our airport and we corrected our destination with Center. At some point during the decent the oil quantity went to ZERO. Oil pressure was fluctuating between 22-28 PSI. The APU was also started to save time if we were to need it. We had set up for Runway 02C and had previously run non normal landing calculations in the event we did approach on a single engine.I had resumed PF duties and shallowed our decent for two reasons. First; we were still 40 miles from ZZZ and second I wanted to add thrust to see where the oil pressure would be before we leveled off closer to the airport. FO brought up the idea to review the procedure for a failure while on short final to the runway. That procedure was reviewed. About 10 miles from the runway the oil pressure started to flash red at 13 PSI and we decided it was time to secure the left engine. [Advised ATC] at this time. FO did a very good job performing the checklist while I continued toward the runway. All was complete and configured by the time we turned final at the glide slope intercept. Approach resulted in an uneventful landing. ARFF was there to look over the plane and with no concerns we then proceed to the gate.After plane was secured at the gate I had made calls to the dispatcher who ended up being a different one who we had been coordinating with. The Chief Pilot called and discussion about flying the other plane to ZZZ1 was initiated. The FO and I answered the Human Factors questions he asked. I was unaware that it was fairly standard practice to remove the crew from all subsequent flying after an even like this. FO had that understanding but I wasn't getting the message he was trying to get across to me.After getting off this call I received a call from the Chief Pilot who essentially did the right thing and removed us from the ZZZ1 flight we thought we were OK to do. His judgment was correct that in hindsight I was not in the state I believed to be in and rest not more flying was the best call. This was apparent the further away I got from this situation.Then another call from the Crew Coordinator and he had us flying the crew's (who had flown the other plane into ZZZ) remaining schedule which would have extended us 2 days beyond our trip. This was contested and amended to have us layover in ZZZ.After all this I received a call from Maintenance Control who wanted some more details about the engine parameters before and after shutdown to help assess the course of maintenance. He mentioned he did not see an ELB (Electronic Logbook) report yet and that he would put it in for me since I had TOTALLY FORGOT due to the multiple distractions I created by making a phone call before report the mechanical issue.Overall CRM (Crew Resource Management) made this event 'uneventful'. Flight attendants; Company Communications System and pilots sharing information and ideas and making decisions based on all resources available to us. Synergy on the flight deck was apparent as between the two of us a comprehensive plan was made and executed with little to no (apparent) stress.",,,,"B737 Captain reported an engine oil system anomaly which resulted in an engine shutdown; and a successful diversion to a suitable alternate airport.",

We performed the 'Elimination Of Odors In The Cockpit/Cabin' checklist; but limited the procedure to the aft cabin/Pack 2 portion of the procedure due to the fact that both the Captain and myself could smell no odor; nor were suffering from any physical/physiological effects.After completing the checklist items; we again established communication with the Flight Attendants and discovered that both the smell; as well as physical/physiological symptoms that they were experiencing; as well as the 'Dirty Sock' smell persisted; we decided to LAND ASAP and ZZZ was selected (with concurrence from Dispatch) as the nearest suitable diversion airport.After briefing the Flight Attendants and Passengers; we diverted to ZZZ and an overweight landing checklist was performed as we were approximately 8000-9000 LBS. over max landing weight. Tower and ground were advised to have EMS meet us at the gate to assist with Flight Attendant and Passenger medical evaluation as needed. Touchdown was smooth and later determined to be well within limits by maintenance. To my knowledge; only one passenger complained of feeling ill; but declined medical treatment; however; all four Flight Attendants complained of feeling nauseous; burning eyes; and dizziness. One flight attendant was observed vomiting in the rear lavatory. After all Flight Attendants were checked at the gate by medical personnel/EMS; they were transported to a nearby medical clinic where it was later learned they had all been diagnosed with Carbon Monoxide Poisoning-with severity ranging from mild to serious. All Flight Attendants as well as Captain performed admirably and professionally during this emergency. All crew members worked together to attain the best possible outcome from unfavorable circumstances that we were presented with yesterday and I have nothing but praise and accolades for our crew.","The reporter stated that the APU was deferred prior to the flight; therefore; the APU was not operating. The reporter stated that a very strong 'dirty sock' odor was only evident in the aft galley area and; it's as if there was a wall containing the odor only in the aft galley area. The reporter added that all the flight attendants required medical attention and it was determined that each had carbon monoxide poisoning. Only one passenger complained of the odor; but declined any medical attention added the reporter. The reporter stated that they turned off the right hand pack and it didn't seem to make a difference; however; they didn't have time to troubleshoot any further because they were on oxygen and were dealing with landing the aircraft as to not exacerbate the situation. The reporter concluded with stating that that they ferried the aircraft for maintenance; but did not use the packs so there was no odor at that time. Additionally; Maintenance said they did not find any discrepancy; but did a duct burn-out to try and clean the AC ducts.","We were greatly delayed because upon arriving at the aircraft; we found that the APU was deferred and no outside air conditioning was connected. The temperature was about 96 degrees on the aircraft and I told the agent we couldn't board until we cooled the aircraft. After connecting ground air and waiting several minutes; we couldn't get the temperature to drop below about 90 degrees on the aircraft. After contacting the chief pilot; we decided to board all the luggage and below wing items and then start an engine at the gate to cool the aircraft. Finally; we boarded and a short time later departed.When we were within a few thousand feet of top of climb; I received a call from the flight attendants. They stated that they had an odor in the cabin that smelled like dirty socks and that they had been told in recurrent ground school to contact the pilots immediately if they had this issue.We proceeded to find and run the appropriate fumes removal checklist and contacted the flight attendants after waiting an appropriate time for circulation of the cabin air. They stated that the smell did NOT go away and in fact; it might be getting worse. We decided to contact dispatch and divert to another airport. ZZZ appeared to be the best choice and nearest in point of time and after coordinating with dispatch we identified as an emergency and proceeded with haste to ZZZ. We had EMS meet the aircraft in case any passengers were reporting symptoms. The flight attendants had all been exposed and two were quite nauseous. They later were checked at the hospital and found positive for minor Carbon Monoxide poisoning.",,"A320 flight crew reported diverting after all four flight attendants noted a dirty sock smell in the aft galley area during climb.",

It sounded as though something had struck the aircraft from outside. All engine instruments read normal and there was no airframe vibration so we pressed on to ZZZ1. On arriving into ZZZ1 during the approach I as the pilot flying called for 'gear down.' There was another violent jolt and we received a GEAR DISAGREE warning and proceeded to do a go-around. During the go-around I used the standard go around callouts and called for 'Gear up.' As soon as I called for the gear up I mentioned to the FO (First Officer) that 'no; we should leave the gear down' but it was too late as he immediately had raised the gear and we felt another violent jolt. ATC climbed us to 5;000 feet where I handed the aircraft to the FO so that I could run the QRH. I ran the QRH and it called for Landing Gear Lever down and Accomplish Normal Landing. The GEAR DISAGREE light extinguished but it was here I noted the R SIDE BRACE light illuminated. I quickly ran thru the (R) SIDE BRACE QRH but was becoming concerned about the fuel remaining as we were down to 6;000 pounds at this point. I instructed the FO we needed to get the aircraft on the ground and initiate the approach with ATC. The FO was still flying the aircraft and handling communications with ATC. I made a quick call to the Flight Attendant Lead and also a brief PA to the passengers explaining the gear problem. ATC had us fly over ZZZ2 Tower and they reported all gear appeared down. We proceeded to land in ZZZ1. Landing was normal but as I was unsure of the status of the gear I informed Tower that we were disabled on the runway.Later I was told that I did not give the Flight Attendants sufficient time to prepare the cabin and that I did not give the 'Brace' signal before landing. I did call and inform the Flight Attendants after the Go Around of our current gear condition after we leveled at 5;000 feet and before attempting to call dispatch. I attempted numerous contacts with Dispatch via Satcom; Telephone; and VHF radio. I answered numerous calls from various Flight Attendants via intercom to the cockpit while attempting to run the QRH. Finally; after noting our fuel quantity at 6;000 pounds and knowing we were to initially land with 10;600 pounds I was focused on getting the aircraft on the ground.

As I pondered my next move the First Officer asked if I smelled that; followed shortly by I think that is the dirty sock smell. Her next comment of 'I'm already feeling nauseated' broke my reverie and both crew members as well as our jump seat occupant donned O2 masks immediately. We attempted to perform the 'Elimination of odor in the flight deck/cabin' procedure. We were hindered in our efforts by the fact that the binder of the first QRH employed broke in half when the First Officer attempted to retrieve it leaving her with nearly 200 loose pages of former QRH. I provided my QRH but the procedure is missing from the back; or anywhere; in this particular aircraft's QRH. Volume 2 was referenced for the procedure which was challenging to find given the constraints of the mask.We leveled the aircraft at 16;000 feet and as the First Officer was already experiencing symptoms I elected to return the aircraft to [the departure airport] without further delay. ATC was notified of our intentions and I terminated the previously mentioned checklist that involved troubleshooting the air packs due to the difficulty in following a procedure through the mask on the Ipad and our need to prepare the aircraft for an air turn back. I never did feel I was able to get a real idea of which pack might be causing the odor. As we descended through 10;000 feet I turned off BOTH packs since I had been unable to determine the source of the odor and opened the ram air valve in an effort to provide as much fresh air to the cabin as possible. The First Officer ran the overweight landing checklist as we were approximately 3000 pounds above max landing weight. ATC vectored us for an ILS Approach which terminated in a successful landing. The aircraft was met by Fire and EMS as well as representatives from flight operations; inflight and local [authorities].The aircraft was deplaned without further incident. The odor event; crew usage of O2 and overweight landing were documented in the logbook post flight. The flight and cabin crew debriefed with the aforementioned parties prior to departing the scene. Both the Airbus and [company] odor/fume reporting sheets were completed and delivered to maintenance. Both pilots and I believe all flight attendants reported to company provided medical care for evaluation afterwards. On further communication with flight attendants it appears at least some of them showed elevated levels of carbon monoxide in the blood tests their doctors performed. Even though the doctor was familiar with these ongoing odor events in the industry and was provided with [union] and IATA guidance for examination no blood testing of the pilots was completed. Perhaps the company [and other parties involved] can work towards a common strategy for post incident comprehensive physical examination of crew members to ensure all bases are covered.Ensure that the Elimination of Odor in Flight Deck/Cabin checklist is added to EVERY QRH in the fleet ASAP. I believe our fleet manager has been working very hard to see this happen. Trying to use an Ipad to find critical checklists while wearing a mask is very difficult even without the presence of visibility restricting particulates in the air. Continue working on resolution to this seemingly complex issue as it appears to affect a large portion of the fleet including both Boeing and Airbus aircraft.",,"After takeoff; as we turned on the packs; I smelled an odor. I said; 'it smells like device fluid.' Then; within seconds; it got very strong and smelled to me like oil. I turned to the Captain and said; 'I think this might be that dirty socks smell. Do you smell that?' I started feeling nauseated and told my Captain. We both immediately donned our oxygen masks. Our jumpseater did as well. I went to my QRH to verify the memory item was complete then to start the Elimination of odor in the flight deck checklist. The QRH binder busted open and I had pages everywhere. Then; I used Captain's to find out the procedure; which was not in this QRH. So; we went to Vol. 2 and decided to level off at 16;000 feet and return to [the departure airport].I advised ATC we had fumes in the aircraft and we needed to return to [the airport]. The Captain gave me control of the aircraft and continued the checklist. We could not determine which pack the fumes were coming from. We turned off both packs through 10;000 feet and opened the Ram Air Valve. I then gave control back to the Captain and contacted company and ran the overweight checklist. We were vectored to land and landed. The fire department and EMS met the aircraft. We successfully deplaned aircraft. All paperwork was filled out and logbook entries made. Maintenance was there and received the odor reporting sheets. The entire flight crew went to get medical treatment evaluations. I personally felt very dizzy and nauseated for the first hour and it lessened as I got fresh air. This fume issue seems to be occurring to often and needs to be resolved. I think Maintenance is having a hard time duplicating the issues we are experiencing.",,"A320 flight crew reported odors in the cockpit requiring a return to the airport.",

Maintenance was called. Maintenance found a broken piece of dish under the arming lever. After the piece was removed; the door was able to be armed; but the arming lever was more difficult than usual to move. Maintenance signed off the 1R door arming lever as operational and we departed. After takeoff; at about 500 feet the number 1 Flight Attendant called the flight deck and told us that he had a flashing cabin pressurization warning light. He was told to standby while the flight crew continued to fly and identify the problem. The 1R door armed light was found to be extinguished. The aircraft was leveled at 10;000 feet for analysis. After determining there was no issue with the aircraft pressurization system and that the problem was likely associated with the arming issue experienced at the gate; we elected to continue the flight as planned.The flight attendants were notified along with an explanation as to what was occurring. Approximately 10 minutes after leveling at cruise at 36000 feet; the number 1 Flight Attendant called to inform us that the other two flight attendants were experiencing symptoms of hypoxia.

After leveling at 24000 feet; the Captain checked on the flight attendants. The Captain was informed that their symptoms were worsening. We immediately [advised ATC].  The portable O2 bottles were used by each affected flight attendant; an onboard doctor began monitoring the situation; and the paramedics were requested to meet us at the gate. Upon arrival at the gate; their symptoms had subsided and the flight attendants reported fit for duty for their next leg. This event occurred due to an equipment failure in flight. If the door arming lever would not have changed status to 'disarmed' after takeoff; this event would not have occurred.I recommend informing both Maintenance and flight attendants that if a door arming lever is difficult to move after a slide replacement; even if the door is able to be armed; do not take the aircraft.

All cockpit indications were normal. The non-flying pilot reviewed the QRH to look for an applicable procedure. The non-flying pilot reviewed the maintenance logbook for previous related write ups and found none. The non-flying pilot made frequent checks with the aft flight attendants every couple minutes to determine if the smell was getting stronger or dissipating and the flight attendants advised everything was the same; the faint smell was not improving or worsening. During the descent; the flight attendants called to report there was visible smoke coming from under the lavatory sink and they had switched off the water heater. Immediately; the non-flying pilot applied the SMOKE/FUMES/AVNCS Smoke Procedure; leading the pilots to turn off the COMM push button to deactivate the power to the lavatory and galleys; [and] continued to check with the aft flight attendants on the status of the smoke.

They said it smelled more like electrical than anything else. I asked if it was just in the lavatory or if it could be smelled anywhere else. I asked if they saw any smoke and if it appeared to be getting better or worse. They said it was strongest in the lavatory; but could slightly be smelled in the aft galley and they did not see any smoke. I asked them to monitor and to immediately let me know if it got worse. I called every few minutes to ask if it was better or worse. Each time they said that it was about the same and that they did not see any smoke. They reconfirmed that the smell was like electrical.I sent a message to Dispatch via ACARS to let them know that Maintenance should be notified as we would want to have it checked out [upon arrival]. We referred to the QRH to be prepared to react as things developed. I called again and explained that if there was visible smoke that I would be turning the emergency exit lights on and turning off all power to the galleys; lavatories; etc. I tried to get them to be more descriptive on the smell and how strong it was so that I could determine if I should start removing power.A few minutes later; during descent to land; they called back to say that they opened the panel under the sink and saw smoke. They turned off the power switch to the water heater and called me. I turned on the emergency exit lights and turned off the commercial button per the QRH. We were about 15 minutes from landing at this point; so the nearest suitable airport was [our destination]. I [advised ATC] and requested crash/fire/rescue to be notified.

We again referenced the QRH checklist and consulted with Dispatch. The odors did not dissipate this time so we [advised ATC]; began an emergency descent; informed the flight attendants and passengers of the new flight plan; and prepared for landing into ZZZ. We used maximum forward speed under PIC (Pilot in Command) emergency authority towards ZZZ to minimize passenger and crew exposure to the fumes. We prepared the aircraft for an overweight landing by following the overweight landing QRH procedure and determined we had adequate performance for landing and go-around at our estimated landing weight of around 172700 lbs.

It was the same 'burnt out vacuum smell' just not as potent as before. I went back to my jumpseat and announced 'aft cabin secure' and then we started to smell a 'musky/sweet dirty sock smell' that got worse as we descended. Passengers were closing their air vents; cringing; and asking what the smell was and were covering their noses and commenting 'you girls aren't flying back on this plane; are you?!' After deplaning; we reported the smell to the captain and that we didn't feel comfortable flying on this aircraft because we want to seek medical attention. We were feeling nauseous; headaches; red/watery eyes; stomachache; and light headedness so we walked out into the jet bridge to get some fresh air through the side door of the jet bridge.

The nurse came in with test results stating all 4 of us flight attendants had elevated levels of carbon monoxide 4 hours after exposure and having been in fresh air and then hooked onto 100% oxygen. The nurse said the company ordered another test to be taken from us that would test for a specific chemical found in jet fuel.

Preflight preparation; push-back; start-up and taxi out were uneventful. We took off on runway XX with a flaps 5 setting. Climb out to FL340 was also uneventful. Approximately 40 minutes after takeoff we got a C HYD QTY EICAS message. We pulled up the status page and noticed that the Center hydraulic quantity was at .43 and decreasing rapidly. The First Officer pulled out the QRH and iPad and referenced the procedures for this anomaly. The Center pumps; both electric and the demand pumps were secured. This slowed the quantity decrease; but did not stop it. I initiated a SATCOM call to Dispatch and was eventually conferenced in with [Maintenance]; the [Operations] and the 756 fleet guys. A detailed discussion ensued covering all implications of continuing the flight or turning around and returning to ZZZZ or another suitable divert aerodrome. The divert option was eventually ruled out as it would involve fuel dumping (13000 available to dump) and at least two hours of loitering to burn down to max landing weight for the 767-300. My concerns about the legality of continuing an ETOPS flight without the Center system and associated loss of our HMG (Hydraulic Motor Generator) were assuaged and we collectively (internal flight crew and external resources) decided to continue the crossing. The flight proceeded normally until approaching ZZZ. I was on third break and returned to the cockpit approximately 50 minutes before scheduled landing. The Center system quantity at this point was .11. The three of us discussed all possible scenarios again and we began our descent. When we checked in with Approach; we [advised ATC] and requested the ILS to XXR so as not to interrupt normal operations on the center and left runways. This also gave us potential maneuvering airspace on the less congested side of the airport.At 6000 ft. and about 35 miles from the approach end of XXR; we ran the checklist items. We were reasonably certain that the Center system would not work due to the 'spoiler' EICAS when I deployed speed brakes on the descent. When the demand pump was turned on; the Center pressure lights remained on; so we continued the applicable checklist. We had slowed to 220 knots clean maneuvering and began to bring the flaps down via the alternate method. As the flaps transited from 0 to 1; we got a LE SLATS ASYMMETRY EICAS and the flaps stopped moving. We were now around 22 miles from the runway and still at 220 knots. We informed tower that we might have to execute a 360 degree turn to work the additional emergency of split slats. We had also lost the Left Yaw damper earlier in the flight. The relief pilot was working the LE slats problem while we continued the alternate flap problem. I called for the alternate gear extension at some point in this process and the gear came down and locked as advertised. I asked the PM (Pilot Monitoring) to select flaps 5 on the alternate switch and around 12 miles from touchdown; the flaps began to move again; but still with the asymmetry indication. I asked the relief pilot if that was going to be a problem and he said 'not if the flaps come down.' We continued to dial the speed back as the flaps came down and after almost 6 minutes from alternate flap initiation and at approximately 8-10 miles; we got the aircraft at flaps 20 and target speed 150 (ref 144 + 6 knots for the wind {120/12}).I disengaged the auto flight at 1500 ft. and flew a normal approach to touch down on XXR. We exited the runway and with the Reserve Steering and Brakes switch engaged had enough standpipe pressure to clear the runway using nose wheel steering. Emergency responders were there immediately and confirmed that we still had hydraulic fluid leaking from the port wheel well area and we soon had zero Center quantity as the remaining fluid leaked out. A tug eventually came and towed us to [our] gate. I would like to say that this was a textbook collaboration of resources; both internal (cockpit and cabin) and external. We worked as a team and resolved what could have been a serious emergency. I kept the pursuer engaged from soon after the caution light until after landing. I did not ask that the cabin be prepared for evacuation; due to the nature of the problem and only an extra 8-10 knot approach speed expected. Although I didn't use the term 'Cabin Advisory'; the words I used when briefing her were reflective of that process. Tip of the hat to all involved and 220 souls on board were happy to have landed safely.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B767 flight crew reported a hydraulic leak that developed inflight worsened inflight causing an Asymmetrical flap and slat problem as well as the loss of the left yaw dampener and primary steering upon landing.",

We donned oxygen masks and I got out the Quick Action Card (QAC); but the FA reported the odor dissipated; so we suspended the procedure and removed our masks. Due to a late clearance for approach from ATC we had to go missed approach and at the same time the FA reported the odor again and stronger than before. We donned oxygen masks and I performed the QAC procedure and talked to ATC while the FO flew the aircraft. We were vectored back around cells for another approach. There was never any smoke visible; just electrical smell which again dissipated after three to four minutes; which is partly why I didn't declare an emergency; but in hindsight I should have anyway. We suspended further procedures after doing the Quick action card; but kept our masks on for the approach and landing; which was uneventful. I put the events in the logbook and debriefed maintenance at the gate. FO and FB performance was exemplary and contributed greatly to a coordinated crew response to a very busy situation.",,"All pilots had returned from break and we were on descent at FL200. Out of FL240 all of us smelled smoke. The Captain told us to don oxygen; which we did. Almost immediately the purser called to report smoke. I asked the Captain if I could check out the cabin and he agreed. I donned the mask and exited the cockpit. I walked the length of the aircraft talking to every Flight Attendant (FA). All had smelled it and all thought it was electrical. I couldn't see any smoke and the smell was dissipating as I returned to the cockpit. Upon my return the smell was virtually gone so we removed masks and continued. It was my sense that it was electrical in nature and definitely neither oil nor Skydrol in the Air Cycle Machine. There were thunderstorms all along the arrival route so we diverted a little south and then turned to the outer marker for XYR. It seems that we were the first airplane to have made an approach since a cell had passed over the field recently; it was very quiet and the only other traffic in the area was behind us. We were vectored for a right base to XYR intercepting outside the FAF at 2000 MSL and then given a heading with a clearance to intercept the localizer. The First Officer (FO); who was flying; was configured with gear down and flaps 3 as we approached the glideslope. As we crossed the GS intercept the FO realized hadn't received an approach clearance yet so we couldn't start down. The Captain called the Tower for clearance but we got stepped on once and ignored or stepped on another time and it took three calls to get an approach clearance. By now we were close to being two dots high but we started a descent to recapture. The FO called for full flaps and deployed the spoilers to get back on glide path. As we descended through 1000 feet we were close to being stable but the spoilers were still deployed. I said; rather loudly; 'The boards are still out. Go Around.' There was a startle effect as the two realized that we were; in fact; at 950 feet and the spoilers were still out. I said again; 'Go Around.' The Captain said; 'Go around' and the FO executed a go around. Within a few seconds we all smelled smoke again. The Captain again ordered us to don our masks which we did.The FO executed a soft go-around (and did a great job); the Captain began executing the QRC and I set up the intercoms so we could talk and then called back to the purser. He said it was worse than before. The Tower gave us directions to climb to 4000 feet and turned us over to the TRACON. Turning downwind I said we should probably declare an emergency. I got no response from the Captain. The Captain executed the QRH procedure; effectively cutting off the packs. After another minute or two I reiterated that would should declare an emergency; stating that landing an airplane with everyone in the front wearing oxygen masks was an emergency in and of itself and that we'd look pretty stupid if something went wrong and we hadn't done so. I don't remember exactly what the Captain said but he demurred. I deferred. Vectoring for final we were now in instrument conditions. We were cleared for the approach but had missed putting the FMS into Approach Mode ('activate/confirm'). The FO selected managed speed and the autopilot pitched to capture the glideslope. The aircraft begin to accelerate and came within 1 knot of an overspeed at 180 knots. He quickly realized what was wrong and put the speed in manual mode; and dialed back the bug to just above VLS. The captain was able to quickly put the aircraft back into approach mode and returned us to managed airspeed; we were stable by 1000 feet; and we landed. The FO is an excellent stick and a bright and cheerful pilot. He did a great job. The Captain was slow and methodical; followed company procedures and kept us all on track. They both did a really nice job and deserve commendation. I would happily fly with both of them again. Two things went wrong with this flight. The first is that Captain madea questionable call not to declare an emergency. He conceded this graciously on the ground and said that he was so busy that he was concerned that declaring an emergency would just make it worse. The second is our failure to get the aircraft in Approach mode on the second approach. The FO had gone to TOGA which restrung the approach and then cleaned up the aircraft; and had done a very nice job of it. I take some responsibility for missing this. It's the job of the FB to see everything and cover for the two guys up front flying. Having said that my two mitigating circumstances are that the Captain's and FO's MCDUs are hard to see from the observer seat; and everything is harder to see when you're wearing an oxygen mask. This is a design flaw of the Airbus. Generally the only way an Airbus will go into Approach mode by itself is if it's on a STAR and crosses a programmed energy reduction point. We seldom do this in the United States which is why SOP is to 'activate and confirm' at 10;000 feet. We train that we will always land the Airbus in managed airspeed mode. The going theory for this is to take advantage of GS mini. My experience over the last ten years is that this works nicely most of the time; especially in the 330 with its wing; but this causes trouble at times; and this was one of them. We are developing an over reliance on automation and the design of the Airbus is contributing to a decline in my flying skills. I work pretty hard to maintain them (in accordance with company policy as outlined in FM Part 1) but I know I make some pilots nervous because they're not used to flying with any of the automation turned off; ever. With the FAA's our Training Department's move to emphasize manual flight I'm hoping this will change. Secondly; the Captain's belief that declaring an emergency would potentially increase his workload is wrong. It's designed to do the opposite. Once we declare an emergency we become the local controller's priority; plus his supervisor; plus everyone else in the tower for that matter. Pilots never (rarely?) like to become melodramatic and declaring an emergency for what we suspect may be trivial will make us feel foolish. But if we had to go around because of the failure of the aircraft in front of us to clear the runway; and our little smoke incident turned into an uncontained fire; we would have certainly been fools.

I asked what the odor smelled like and she stated she wasn't sure. I then asked her if it smelled like something burning; electrical; or fuel. She stated it was probably more of a fuel smell. I asked her if the smell was throughout the cabin and she wasn't sure. I then called the forward #1 Flight Attendant and asked her if she had any strange odors in the forward cabin. She stated no; she smelled nothing. I then asked the aft cabin Flight Attendant if any passengers could smell the odor and if passengers were becoming nauseated. She did not know. I then asked her to walk forward from the rear of the cabin toward the front to determine where the smell began and where it stopped and to check and see how the passengers in the affected cabin were feeling. At this point the First Officer and I started the Aircraft Odor checklist. Several minutes later the aft cabin Flight Attendant called me back and stated that one passenger thought the odor smelled like hydraulic fluid and several others thought it smelled like fuel. She also stated the smell began around Row 17 and continued all the way back to the aft galley/rear of the aircraft; but that it seemed to be less intense. I then asked her how she was feeling and how the passengers were feeling. She reported that both of them (#2 and #4 flight attendants) and several passengers were now feeling nauseous; light headed and dizzy. I asked if she thought the odor still smelled like fuel and if the odor was getting stronger and she stated yes.At this point; with the number #1 Flight Attendant also on the interphone; I explained to them that I was going to [advise ATC] and get us on the ground as quickly as possible; and that I would get back to them shortly. I quickly gave the aircraft and radio control over to the First Officer and had him [advise ATC]; directing him to proceed direct to the RNAV IAF. I then completed the Aircraft Odor checklist with the assumption being FUEL as the possible source. The difficulty for me in accomplishing this checklist was trying to determine if the odor was classified as strong or as mild/moderate. I chose strong and proceeded to the Smoke; Fire and Fumes checklist. Accomplishing this checklist left me somewhat confused since we had no smoke; fire or fumes; but rather a strong aircraft odor that smelled like fuel. In this case the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist sent me back to the Aircraft Odor Checklist. By this point in the Aircraft Odor Checklist we had started our descent and I then referred to and accomplished the non routine landing checklist; advised dispatch via ACARS; briefed the #1 Flight Attendant on a precautionary landing and emphasizing no ground evacuation anticipated; and then made an address to the passengers regarding our situation. Once I was able to focus my attention back in the cockpit I accomplished the descent checklist and then took back control of the aircraft. The First Officer did an outstanding job getting the aircraft direct and coordinating with ATC. The approach and landing were uneventful. Once we landed and cleared the runway I let the flight attendants know what was occurring and that we were not going to evacuate. I then stopped the aircraft on a taxiway and had the fire chief check our aircraft; in particular for potential fuel leaks and/or heat signatures. Then I made a passenger address further explaining what was occurring outside the aircraft and that everything was ok and safe. The fire chief then gave us an all clear report and we proceeded to our gate with the fire trucks following closely behind. Once at the gate and parked the aft cabin flight attendants called again and reported that the fuel odor/fumes were even stronger than before. Within a minute the fire chief came to the cockpit and report strong fuel fumes outside around the airplane. We quickly deplaned the passengers. Hind sight indicates an obvious fuel leak that penetrated the air conditioning system.According to the QRH Aircraft Odor Checklist; an ODOR is not smoke or fumes associated with a fire source; an odor is any smell; and a fume is dangerous to inhale. So what did I have on my flight an ODOR or a FUME? With so many new; young; and inexperienced flight attendants in our airline today the descriptions; or lack of descriptions; leave Captains unsure of what really is an odor or a dangerous fume. Once on the ground and at the gate it was clear that we had a major fuel leak; fume; or vapor problem. I think we should look at further defining the word FUMES in our Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist to include Fuel Fumes. Furthermore; with hindsight as a guide; I think the checklist needs to address passenger electronic equipment; which should be immediately turned off and shut down if fuel fumes exist in the cabin. Numerous cases in the United States have had individuals igniting gasoline fumes at fueling pumps while parked at a gas station; blowing up the entire gas station and killing themselves; all because they answered their cell phone or turned on the light function on their cell phone. Static electricity appears to be the problem with electronic devices; and if fuel fumes are strong enough in the cabin of an airplane; then the subsequent result could be catastrophic.",,"[Reported narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B737 flight crew reported fuel fumes/odor in the aft cabin resulted in a direct approach and landing at the planned destination.",

I noticed smoke at that time coming from behind the First Officer. Oxygen Masks were donned and communications established. First Officer was already flying so I assigned him flying and ATC Communication duties. I start Quick Action Items and QRH procedures.FO (First Officer) notified ZZZ Center under my direction and navigated back towards ZZZ airport.QRH procedures were performed methodically and we found the source of smoke to be Air Conditioning problems associated with Pack 1.Smoke went away immediately after accomplishing QRH procedures. Then established communications with flight attendants through interphone system. They stated NO Smoke in the cabin. Informed them we had smoke in the cockpit that was contained and were returning to ZZZ.I asked them to prepare for a precautionary landing and gave an ETA. Then made a PA to passengers that we had a maintenance situation that required a return to ZZZ.We reviewed the non-routine landing checklist in QRH. Rest of the flight was normal SOP. No Limitations were exceeded nor any flight parameters. ie. Heading; altitude; directions in generalWe can't avoid these types of situations but I will say; the resources and procedures available to us contained the situation quickly. I can't think of anything different that would have helped in this situation. Communication was outstanding within the crew; ATC; emergency services in ZZZ and the company.",,"On departure out of ZZZ during initial climb out; we experienced the flight deck temperature increasing substantially. I was the Flying Pilot and the Captain was the Non-Flying Pilot. The Captain adjusted the temperature control to try and cool off the cockpit. Approximately 10 minutes into the flight climbing out of FL220 for an assigned altitude of FL280; I noticed smoke in the cockpit. I immediately donned my oxygen mask and established communication with the Captain who was in the process of donning his oxygen mask. Once we established effective communication; he gave me control of radio communications and I stated that I have positive control of the aircraft as well as radio communications. The Captain then went to the quick action checklist and found the smoke/avionics smoke/fumes procedure. The number 2 item on that particular procedure was to land ASAP if smoke was confirmed which it was. The Captain asked me to inform air traffic control. The Captain continued the checklist and I immediately [notified] Center. I told Center that we needed to also level off which I did at FL240. ATC asked what our intentions were and I stated that we needed to return to ZZZ. I was then given a left hand turn direct to ZZZ. I also requested a descent to FL100. I then provided ATC with souls on board and fuel remaining. We had 109 souls on board and 22;600 pounds of fuel. The Captain continued the checklist and made communication with the flight attendants to determine the conditions in the cabin. According to the flight attendants; there wasn't any smoke in the cabin but they did notice an unusual odor. We determined that the air ventilation and conditioning was the probable cause for smoke in the cockpit. Once the Captain selected the PACK 1 OFF; the smoke dissipated and went away. The Captain completed the checklist and then took back the radio communications while I continued to fly the aircraft. He then communicated to the passengers of our return to ZZZ. The Captain then contacted the company to let them know our situation and our intentions. He also made sure to brief the flight attendants of our return to ZZZ. During this time of checklist; I was getting weather and setting up for a visual approach backed up by [the] ILS into ZZZ. Approach control gave us priority landing. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) was in position on the far end of [the] runway as we approached. We landed without any further complications and came to a complete stop once exiting the runway and re-evaluated our situation before we continued to parking. I advised Tower that we had no other problems and no smoke was present. We then taxied to the gate and deplaned the passengers. We believe the event occurred because the PACK 1 had and overheat condition. We believe this was the reason why we had smoke in the cockpit considering we completed the appropriate checklist and was able to ventilate the cockpit and remove the smoke by selecting the PACK 1 OFF. The only suggestion I can make is to be more attentive to the temperature within the cabin and cockpit prior to takeoff and doing a last minute assessment to determine if conditions are uncomfortable or out of a normal range.",,"A319 Flight Crew reported smoke entered the cockpit during climb that dissipated when Pack 1 was selected to off.",

This was a mistake and make no claim to knowledge or thinking it might work; ie. experimenting. QRH seems to not cover our faults; reset for initial fault seemed reasonable.

This noise progressively got louder. After about 10 minutes we began to feel vibrations on floor in flight deck. Cabin crew could then hear noise in forward cabin as well. I put in a request for dispatch to call me on VHF and include maintenance (MX) on the line. While dispatch was getting maintenance on line we began to smell odor of hot wires or electrical components. This became stronger pretty quickly. I began to survey alternate options. Determined best options based on ND display and MCDU were ZZZ about 70 miles east and ZZZ1 about 160 west. I decided on ZZZ and advised dispatch of deteriorating conditions when he returned to frequency with MX. He agreed that ZZZ was good diversion and stated he would advise all necessary parties and send landing data. I transferred controls to FO (First Officer); [notified ATC]; and set up FMGC for approach while FO worked on descent. Briefed cabin crew of diversion with TEST items stating cabin prep was not required. About halfway thru descent to ZZZ the avionics cooling blower fan ceased and the CB tripped. With this; the fumes and noise stopped. Normal landing on runway XX and taxi to gate. Fire rescue crews remained on scene until MX Could open compartment to examine cooling fan. Passengers deplaned using jetway.",,"An hour and twenty minutes into our flight the Captain and I both noticed a loud grinding noise from under the floor of the cockpit; associated with a noticeable vibration. There was also a noticeable electrical smell. The aircraft had a previous write up for a tripped avionics blower circuit breaker; so we determined that this was probably the issue and decided to divert to ZZZ since it was 70 miles to our east. The Captain transferred aircraft control to me; along with the radios; while he coordinated with dispatch on VHF2. I [notified ATC] and we were given direct to ZZZ with a descent. While I coordinated with ATC the Captain briefed the flight attendants and then passengers on the diversion. It was determined that an emergency egress would not be required since the avionics blower circuit breaker tripped during the descent and the electrical smell dissipated; however we still had emergency equipment standing by to meet us upon landing.

On approximately 12-mile final; we heard ATC call out traffic behind us converging towards the parallel 16R. Shortly after; we received our first RA. The First Officer (FO) reacted appropriately and we were quickly Clear of Conflict. We informed Approach and let them know we were continuing. Again; at around a seven or eight mile final; we received an RA to descend. Following the RA we got fast (approximately 190 KIAS). We also descended to approximately 7600 feet before the RA went away. At that point we began a very shallow non-standard go-around because we were partially configured; closing on the traffic in front of us; and concerned much of a climb would put us into conflict with the traffic behind us again. Frankly; we were threading a needle because ATC had high radio congestion; there was traffic in front of us; traffic to our right; and traffic on approach to our left. While reacting the second time; we informed ATC and let them know we would be going around. ATC gave us a warning that we were too low; and switched us to Tower for go-around instructions.

As I rolled out on final; the TA went away. ATC had not mentioned anything about the traffic behind us. Once established on final course; we were instructed no slower than 160 knots to FAF. I rolled MCP speed to 160 and began slowing from 180. We then got an RA displaying double red line box above the horizon and 'descend' aural warning. I disengaged autopilot and auto throttles and positioned the nose of the aircraft below the red box; approximately on the artificial horizon. The RA went away and I leveled off and continued with the approach manually. The Captain informed ATC of the RA. About 30 seconds later it happens again; and I responded the same. At that point we had descended below glideslope due to RA commands. Once we cleared the RA; we were level around 960 feet AGL.

Upon reaching HIMOM (IF) we were unable to continue the RNAV approach because we dropped LNAV and so we requested the visual approach to Runway 34R. The controller cleared us for the visual approach to 34R then offered a runway change to 35L even though the controller stated that it might be 'a little late in the game to switch'. We accepted the runway change and decided to switch. I had already disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles in anticipation for landing on Runway 34R. We were assigned a 080 heading for the visual to Runway 35L. We were then given a subsequent turn to 020 to intercept final for Runway 35L. Attempting to hand fly the aircraft and make sure the new approach was loaded by the Captain; and acquire an electronic centerline to the new runway; my workload increased to a level I didn't anticipate. This caused me to inadvertently shallow my turn to final. While trying to work through this issue I lost situational awareness and was focused more on making sure the ILS was loaded for RWY 35L instead of visually clearing my turn and getting established on final. During the turn to/through final we got an RA from TCAS that stated to level off. I leveled the aircraft and the Captain notified ATC of the RA and they stated for us to fly the LOC for Runway 35L. The controller then asked if we could continue the approach or if we needed to go missed approach. We were high and too close to continue the approach due to leveling off for the RA so we executed a missed approach and were given vectors for the missed.

This was NOT a reduced power takeoff as is usually the case per the performance numbers we received on ACARS. It was a normal takeoff with no discrepancies noticed. We were assigned a left turn heading 320 with our takeoff clearance and began the turn as we were passing 400 FT AGL. When established in the turn and climbing through approximately 600 FT; we heard a very loud bang from the left engine and felt the airplane shudder in response. I immediately looked at the engine instruments on the E/WD (upper screen) and noticed the EGT dial in red with a tick at the very upper end of the instrument and also noticed the rest of the engine instruments were in amber; many of them with XX's for the readouts. I had immediately thought we hit a goose as there were many reports of geese sightings during our approach just a couple of hours prior. As we were passing through a heading appropriate for a crosswind leg of a VFR pattern; my intention was to fly a visual pattern back to the field as quickly as possible. My main concern was the possibility of hitting another goose and losing our remaining engine. I was hand-flying at the time and thought we were at a safe altitude; and instructed the Pilot Monitoring (PM) to run the ENG FAIL ECAM and secure the engine as we were headed right around for a return to [departure airport]. It became clear to both of us that ATC had cleared the area for us. They provided us an exceptional level of support and vectored us to a final. Though we had no time to contact Dispatch; we did brief the flight attendants on the event (which they had already figured out) and told them that it should be an uneventful landing. At the time of our departure; [the airport] was changing over from a sole east operation to [a different plan] with winds increasing in speed out of the south. As I was trying to change the destination in the MCDU in order to set up the approach in the box; ATC provided us the frequency and vectored us over to [the runway]; providing us the new localizer frequency. I was unable to change the destination and abandoned that attempt in order to fly the LOC and G/S in for a safe landing. With a quartering tailwind; the approach was becoming increasingly unstable and as we were approaching the final gate at 500 FT AGL; I determined it was safest to go-around at about 700 FT. The procedures for the single-engine go-around were executed and ATC vectored us back to the downwind asking us the requested runway and the intercept mileage inbound. We requested a runway change to the longest runway given that we were overweight. We requested a five-mile final not wanting to go out too far. The second approach was flown meeting all the stabilized approach criteria at every gate to a smooth landing; as I wanted to minimize the vertical rate of descent at touchdown. We rolled out long; cleared the runway and stopped the aircraft on the parallel taxiway in order for the ARFF to inspect the engine from afar. They saw no visible damage. Before taxiing the aircraft further; I made a PA to the passengers advising them of the issue and that we were safely on the ground and apologized for not updating them sooner as we were very busy managing the event. We received our new gate assignment and parked the aircraft and did our parking checklist. Codes were sent for the overweight landing and the engine failure. We were met at the gate by Flight Operations Management who ensured we were OK and we proceeded down to the tarmac to inspect the engine together after the passengers deplaned.",,"Max takeoff [and] everything was normal climbing past 500 feet. Below 1000 feet AGL in a left turn to 320 we heard an incredibly loud bang and the aircraft started to vibrate. Captain stated we lost an engine; and we received the Engine Fail ECAM and the master caution. Tower asked us if we would like extended vectors; or immediate return. I asked the Captain and we both decided it best to get on the ground ASAP. At the time we believed we had ingested a bird and were worried for more wildlife damaging the other engine and were not sure how badly damaged the engine was. I began running the ECAM while the Captain continued the climbout and level off I completed most of the ECAM as we were getting ready to turn base; and tried programming the FMC; but began to run out of time. I advised the flight attendants of the situation; that we would be on the ground shortly and that no evacuation was anticipated. Approach vectored us in very close to the runway; and we also had a strong quartering tailwind which led to us being high on final; and the Captain made the decision to go-around. We executed the single engine go around maneuver and advised Tower. They asked us what we wanted to do and we decided for a longer final for the longer runway. At this time the ECAM was complete so I was able to reprogram the FMC completely and get the proper approach loaded up. We got vectored around for the single engine ILS. I again notified the flight attendants that we would be on the ground shortly and to not expect an evacuation. We were able to accomplish a successful approach and landing. We taxied off the runway and had personnel inspect the engine who verified they did not see any damage. We taxied into the gate uneventfully.",,"A320 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after experiencing an engine failure shortly after takeoff.",

He became very ill; very fast; in what I would describe as extreme pain; as well as nausea and vomiting. It came in waves; and got progressively worse. We brought the First Officer; who was on break; back to the flight deck early. The Captain retreated to the rest seat in discomfort. Due to the awkward switch out; the First Officer sat in the left seat. I remained in the flying right seat as the First Officer was disoriented and needed to be briefed. I remained in the right seat. I briefed the First Officer on the situation; as well as the lead Flight Attendant. Up until this point; the Captain did not want any medical treatment; because he was not wanting to interfere with the flight. When he retreated to the rest seat; his situation became much worse; and a doctor was paged for.I briefed the First Officer that I did not feel comfortable with the Captain returning; at any point; to his seat based on his condition. The First Officer agreed; and the lead Flight Attendant also in a separate conversation expressed the same feeling. The First Officer and I decided he would remain in the left seat; and I continue flying and execute the landing from the right seat. As the Captain's situation got worse; him returning became a non-issue; because he was unable to return to the flight deck and we deemed him incapacitated in the sense that we were now operating without referring to the Captain for decisions because he was being tended to by doctors; was in audible pain; violently vomiting; and all the symptoms of a bad kidney stone. The passengers didn't see anything.The First Officer and I worked with dispatch; medlink; and together formulated a game plan. After a warm compress made no difference; the decision was made by Medlink; the onboard doctor; and us; to divert. The Captain also expressed that he was a '12 out of 10' in pain. Having flown with the Captain before; for him to even admit pain means it's big. For him to now be ok diverting confirmed he clearly was not in good shape. His audible pain and vomiting continued. After considering multiple airports; an airport was decided on due to it being exactly 170 miles in front of the nose; a hub; access to medical care; connecting flights for passengers; and a known airport since we'd now be taxiing the aircraft. It was middle of the night; clear weather; and while we knew this airport is busy; this situation warranted it as a diversion.I [notified] ATC. I was also the pilot flying now and the First Officer took care of the rest of the satellite call with Medlink and Dispatch; worked the cabin aspect; and other Pilot Monitoring duties. ATC was great and we barely had to turn; we received a straight in to the runway. We made sure not to mention the word 'captain' on the radio due to the sensitive nature of the emergency; however after inquiring; ATC did know it was a member of the flight deck crew. We also left the PAs very vague and did not say it was the Captain to avoid panic. We followed the diversion [procedures]; and had a rather uneventful diversion and landing. The First Officer did a great job with a quick taxi - we rolled to the end of the runway; and simply made the left turn to the terminal. That's where the problems began. As soon as we turned onto the ramp; I did not see any blue flashing lights. That worried me; because they knew for the last 25 minutes that we were diverting in with a severe medical emergency; and needed an ambulance. None was inside. To summarize; we waited 40 minutes after touchdown for a simple paramedic in a sedan to come. He gave us attitude; said he just got out of work [very early in the morning]; do not rush him; and he would determine whether or not an ambulance was needed; not us. When he determined an ambulance was needed; we waited almost an additional hour for the ambulance. The final times I recorded looked like this: ON at XX:55Z; IN at XY:09Z; paramedic showed up at XY:35Z; and ambulance at XZ:23Z. Unacceptable.I tried multiple frequencies; begged multiple people; including operations; and Tower even though we were parked at the stand to get help. None was available; and the Captain now appeared to almost be going into shock. People became curious and we tried to keep everyone seated. Excuses from operations; paramedic; and staff was that we were the third flight needing an ambulance that morning. I will not go into more detail as my feelings are beyond strong that the airport failed us on the medical front. It not only was an embarrassment; but the Captain could have become more injured. Finally when the ambulance came; the Captain walked down on his own power. I made sure to cover his uniform and hide his hat/jacket so the passengers wouldn't take photos out the window 'of the sick captain.' He went to a hospital; and we waited a few more hours to wrap up hotel and the logistical aspects. I'd like to personally say our whole crew; dispatch; medlink; ATC; and airport operations staff were all fantastic. A great team effort turned this medical emergency into a smooth rolling practiced procedure.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B767 flight crew reported diverting due to Captain's illness.",

Weather was 040/09kts; 1 SM visibility; BR (mist); OVC002. We departed off RWY XX using Flaps 5 with Engine Anti-ice ON. Assigned to fly runway heading to 10;000 feet. Once level cleared direct to ZZZZZ intersection and climb and maintain 23;000. PF (Pilot Flying) commenced the turn and climb using VNAV and LNAV. Passing through approximately 18;000 the PNF noticed the left engine oil quantity at 6 quarts and decreasing. PNF remarked that he checked it prior to departure and knew that it was good. PNF mentioned to PF that we should level off and slow down to monitor the engine parameters. ATC was informed; 'we may have a potential problem and need to level off.' ATC granted an early level off and asked the nature of our problem. The PNF stated that the left engine oil quantity was decreasing but all other indications were normal. PNF and PF discussed the possibility that it could possibly be only the one gauge indicating a malfunction but decided that it would be prudent to turn back towards ZZZ in case other indications began to manifest. The PNF asked ATC for a return to ZZZ stating that the left engine was still operating but there was a possibility of an engine shutdown should the left engine indications continue to deteriorate. PF followed ATC instructions. PNF looked through 737 QRH for an ENG OIL QTY LOW checklist but there was not one. PNF did find an Engine LOW OIL PRESSURE and Engine High Oil Temperature checklist but neither of these applied. PNF began to review the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist in case it became necessary to shut down the engine. Soon afterwards; the left engine oil quantity decreased to zero; the left engine oil pressure dropped to zero (?); and the left engine oil temperature turned red. The PNF then performed the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist and secured the left engine. ATC was informed that the left engine was now secured; the need for delay vectors to complete all required checklists and program the FMC for the approach and landing; and the fuel remaining and number of souls onboard. The PNF sent a quick message to Dispatch stating;' Left ENG oil quantity zero. Return to ZZZ.' The PF flew all assigned headings and altitudes. The PNF completed the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist and informed the lead Flight Attendant of the nature of the emergency and that we would be landing in approximately 15 minutes. The PNF then informed the passengers of the situation and that we would be landing shortly. The PF used the autopilot at all times and was able to program the FMC and set up the approach while the PNF was finishing up checklists; briefings; PA announcements. The PNF then ran the ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE LANDING checklist using VREF ICE speeds. Landing weight was approximately 1;000 lbs below max landing weight; NON-NORMAL CONFIGURATION LANDING DISTANCE for One Engine Inoperative Landing Flaps 15 was adequate. PNF told the PF to continue to fly the ILS XYR approach to landing since he had a good feel for the aircraft and its trim condition. PNF quickly set up his own approach plates; and confirmed crossing altitudes; minimums; frequencies; etc. Both the PNF and the PF felt confident that the aircraft was well stabilized and ready for the approach and landing. PF flew the ILS XYR approach and landed very nicely. The ZZZ fire trucks had already been alerted and were standing by. Normal landing and taxi to the gate.

We got off the gate several minutes early; followed by an early takeoff. After a normal takeoff; we began our climb out and accelerated towards 300 KIAS.Passing approximately 11;500 feet; I noticed a faint electrical smell and asked the CA (Captain) if he picked up the smell. We immediately looked outside for indications; scanned instruments; and checked systems pages. All appeared normal. Very shortly after scanning and passing approximately 13;000 feet; we experienced a loud 'bang;' followed by pronounced roll into the number one engine. A quick instrument scan revealed excessive EGT; followed by rapid decrease in engine performance. We vocalized what appeared to be engine failure number one. CA called ECAM; which also displayed/confirmed a failed number one engine. I immediately started a level off. After several verbal confirmations of a failed number one engine (we wanted to be certain we were focused on the failed engine); the CA ran the ECAM. Having determined we had a damaged engine; we confirmed no desire to relight and CA discharged agent one.I turned back towards ZZZ and CA [notified ATC]. I then took over coms; coordinating our descent and vectors to ZZZ; while CA communicated with dispatch; FAs (Flight Attendants) and let passengers know our situation/intentions. Because we had just landed at ZZZ one-hour prior; we were familiar with the weather; approach and 12;000 foot runway. With some clouds in the surrounding area; we briefed our plan to use vectors RNAV XX (same approach we flew one-hour prior) as our tool to get a solid visual lock on the field; then remain VMC. Once visual; we wanted to focus on flying a stable single-engine visual approach to landing (without the added effort of flying an IFR approach in VMC conditions). With briefing complete; CA became PF; while I became PM (Pilot Monitoring). Continuing our descent and well prior to FAF; I confirmed emergency equipment on rollout; called field in sight; and we proceeded inbound visually.CA flew a beautiful single engine landing. We landed at XX:50Z; we flew for 22 minutes.I made callouts; announced 'remain seated; remain seated' and coordinated for a stop and inspection. Once determined safe to taxi; we taxied to gate.",,"This was our 3rd flight of the day in the same aircraft. Approximately 10 minutes after takeoff; climbing through approximately 13;000 feet we experienced a loud bang; jolt; followed by aircraft roll to the left. Number 1 (left) engine experienced a compressor stall with aircraft EGT extremely high (735 deg) and then engine failure. FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying) and I accomplished ECAM procedures for Engine 1 Failure with damage. Engine 1 was shut down; Fire Button pushed; and #1 Bottle discharged IAW with ECAM procedure. [ATC was notified]; vectors to return to ZZZ. I sent Dispatch an ACARS message; coordinated with FA's (Flight Attendants) (did not need cabin prep at the time); made a passenger PA announcement; and reprogrammed the FMGC for a return to ZZZ. I then got back in the loop with the FO and took over PF duties and had FO refer to QRH procedures. We accomplished a quick brief for the RNAV RWY XX as that was the only approach available and we had previously flown it. It was VFR conditions below 2000 feet. We were cleared direct ZZZZZ and cleared for the approach. I needed some maneuvering to continue normal descent just east of ZZZZZ; then at 2000 feet airport was in sight and informed controller we were descending to 1500 feet because I wanted to be completely stable by FAF. Controller informed us we were descending below minimum vectoring altitude and we let him know we were VFR with airport in sight. Continued on approach course for RNAV and flew in visual conditions to uneventful single engine landing. Stopped straight ahead on runway and had Fire/Rescue team inspect engine and aircraft. Taxied back to gate after confirmation of no damage to aircraft. Estimate engine failure to landing was approximately 8-10 minutes. When local maintenance inspected the engine the compressor blades were okay but they found metal fragments in the engine.NOTE: Just prior to this event the FO said he smelled something faintly that may have smelled electrical. We checked all systems screens and everything was normal; we talked about a divert plan just in case and continued to monitor but everything was normal. Shortly after the engine failure occurred.

A substantial climb was directed from the RA guidance. The target showed 0 feet deviation from our altitude and at our location. The RA maneuver was performed without delay. Traffic was never seen. ATC was advised of the TCAS RA climb. ATC said there was no radar traffic in our vicinity. Just as suddenly as the target appeared it then disappeared. Could this have been a device other than another aircraft?ATC asked if we could still do the approach and we answer with the affirmative. As we were configuring; ATC slowed us to 170 knots. This added difficulty to get on the profile. We were on path but still fast approaching 500 ft radar altitude and a 'go around' was executed immediately. A 20 kt tailwind for the majority of the approach; a 170 kt speed assignment; along with our prior RA maneuver prevented us from being stable at 500 ft call.

We receive deviation clearance to the left from Control. We change course and continue descent. Visibility zero. When abeam of the cell on our right side; we flew through some imbedded cumulus and a short burst of rain.

A lot of confusion at the gate after the passengers deplaned with an army of cleaners coming aboard to 'turn' the aircraft. I saw FA A was moving aft to speak to FAs C and B while the cleaners and ground supervisors were on the airplane between us. The paramedics had left the jetway with the ill passenger. It was going to be difficult to wade through the cleaners to speak to my crew who were scheduled to fly the aircraft back to [origin]. Not having heard from them while at the gate; [First Officer] and I assumed our cabin crew were okay. We exited the aircraft to start our overnight.24 hours later; [First Officer] and I arrived at the aircraft for the northbound flight to [origin]. FA C and FA B were present and met us. It was then when we heard that they had sustained injury during the previous day while standing in the rear galley from the moderate turbulence jolt event. Both crew members complained of back and shoulder strain. In addition; FA C had sustained a small cut on her hand while grabbing a hand hold to steady herself.The event occurred because I failed to warn the cabin crew of possible moderate turbulence during descent. So; the crew was completing normal duties when the unexpected turbulence occurred. As is well known; turbulence effects are magnified when in the aft section of aircraft and also there was no warning of small bumps before the big jolt took place.I need to communicate better with my cabin crew during flight to warn them about turbulence ahead and also at the gate after such an event (by intercom; if necessary); to make sure that they are okay.

We requested to level off (FL 180); and started the QRH procedure for a -700 Pack Trip Off. The procedure calls for increasing pack temperature to reduce load; which was unresponsive in both auto and manual modes; and a reset of the pack was also unsuccessful. During the reset attempts; cabin pressure began climbing; and a further descent was requested (10;000 feet). The Captain began an assertive descent; when around 12;000 feet MSL; the cabin altitude alarm sounded. We followed the memory items to don masks and establish communications; and leveled at 10;000 feet shortly thereafter. Since masks were no longer required; we took them off; elected to return to our departure airport; and landed without further incident. Being a very dynamic situation with limited time and procedures complicated due to an already deferred pack; some of the procedures and communications could have been better to facilitate CRM and lessen distraction and confusion during the event.",,"We departed ZZZ with MEL 21-1-XX; Left AC pack inoperative. Passing through approximately 16;500 feet; I noticed the cabin rate was climbing and the cabin pressure was approaching 8000 feet. We asked for a level off at FL 180. At level off; the Right Pack Trip Off light illuminated and I asked the FO (First Officer) for the Pack Trip Off Checklist. The cabin pressure continued to rise and we asked for (and were granted) a descent to 10;000 feet. As the Pilot Flying; I lowered the nose using Vertical Speed mode and the speedbrake to get the aircraft down to a safer cabin altitude. Passing through approximately 14;000 feet; the Cabin Altitude Warning horn sounded and the Cabin Altitude light illuminated. We immediately performed our QRC memory items; donning our oxygen masks with regulators set to 100% and commencing to establish Crew communications. After leveling off at 10;000 feet; I noticed the Cabin Altitude light extinguished and the cabin pressure altitude was at a safe level to remove our masks. We continued with all of our checklist procedures and the Right Pack would not reset. After requesting a return to ZZZ; we were given the ZZZZZ Arrival direct to ZZZ1; and subsequently ATC said they would be giving us vectors back to ZZZ. As we continued completing our checklists; I didn't come back and ask if the headings were given because of any navigational errors. ATC asked if we were [advising] and we told them 'No'. Landing and taxi to the gate were uneventful and the masks did not drop in the Passenger cabin. The flight attendants and First Officer confirmed they were doing fine; and I am not aware of any medical issues from the passengers after our return to the gate.Even though it was not the middle of summer in ZZZ; I am not sure it is good Customer Service to fly Revenue Passengers on a flight with only one operating AC Pack when considering passenger comfort. Taxiing out; I noticed the aircraft was not as cool as normal. As the Captain; I felt I gave a thorough Captains brief with the FO during our preflight briefings. Using both of our EFBs; we went over the entire MEL and Pressurized Flight with One Pack Inoperative. I noticed during climbout the cabin pressure was higher than normal; but attributed this to having the use of only one operating AC pack. In retrospect; it would have been a better idea to have asked immediately for a lower altitude the first time I noticed the cabin pressure increasing; instead of just asking to level off. Additionally; over the past few years we have had increased training using our oxygen masks in the simulator. Even with training; we initially had difficulty talking with the mask; so I recommend continuing to emphasize this training with our Aircrews.",,"737 flight crew reported a return to departure airport due to a loss of pressurization.",

About six miles out I noted from TCAS that we were 3.5 miles in trail. We configured then to get a little more space. At that point the aircraft ahead disappeared from the TCAS screen but was still in sight. As we passed approximately 350 ft the 767 cleared the runway. At approximately 150 ft we began to encounter the wake vortices with a rolling moment that required full lateral controls to counteract. Still within the vortices; I sensed that the 'bottom was beginning to drop out.' I directed the First Officer to go around; which he immediately did. At the same time a plane was taking off from 24L. At this time I believe Tower directed a heading 270; about 20 degrees right; [and] to contact Departure on a frequency I missed and to state reason for go around. At about the end of the runway I reported the [other] aircraft in sight; but we then got a TCAS RA. We began to respond to the RA; which I believe was initially to descend. Once clear I stated reason for the go around was for wake turbulence; got the right departure frequency and called Departure. Departure gave us a climb to 5000 feet. Due to the fact of the RA and what I believe may have been our failure to select TOGA on go around we were not getting any flight director guidance. Puzzled by this; we were slow to climb. ATC informed us they couldn't turn us back until we got to 5000 feet. I took the aircraft; climbed quickly and ATC turned us back to SMO for another approach.

No one else I spoke to during or after any of these events had ever experienced or heard of this either. Now I know this odor is associated with fume events. In the future; I would not accept an aircraft after a similar series of linked events during preflight without further investigation and correction into the root cause. In this situation; I should have taken the time to pre-plan what to do if Pack 2 produced fume odors during various phases of flight. More generally; I will learn from this experience and incorporate it into risk assessments for accepting deferred maintenance items.The Safety Department should publish de-identified summaries of this and other fume events to allow other crews to learn from this experience as well--particularly that this type of smell can exist.The Safety Department should follow up with the flight attendants to ensure that they receive appropriate medical care and that no disciplinary action is taken against them for calling out sick on the line.[The company] must continue to investigate the causes and prevention of fume events. In particular; the same aircraft had numerous fume events in the several days following this flight. Repeatedly returning this aircraft to service without correcting the root cause is unacceptable.The mechanic attempted to intimidate and interfere with me in the performance of my duties contrary to 14 CFR 91.11 and 121.580; and he refused an opportunity to reconsider and learn from his actions. This indicates his conduct was willful. Mechanics are well-trained and experienced employees held to a high standard. The Company must take disciplinary action against him.Flight Operations Management was not concerned that a mechanic attempted to intimidate and interfere with me; and Management did not provide my requested assistance in expediting transportation to the hospital for the flight attendants. Instead; Flight Operations Management was concerned about whether I had implied liability to passengers; why I had requested ARFF; and whether I was going to be unable to operate my next flight. The Safety Department should discuss with Flight Operations Management the need to provide requested assistance to flight crews dealing with emergencies; and the need to avoid creating undue pressures against flight crews taking the safest course of action.The flight attendants' immediate communication allowed us to correct the problem right away and substantially reduce the severity of the fume event. The First Officer did a great job on this flight; as well as during the entire trip. He completed the abnormal/emergency procedures and communications I delegated to him quickly and correctly so I could focus on landing. Maintenance Control and the other local mechanics took the time to thoroughly discuss the event with me to assist in their troubleshooting.

He had trouble getting bags in bin and slammed bins. He approached fwd galley asking C Flight Attendant for Band-aid with finger bleeding. The OPS agent came to finish up and I asked him what was going on with this passenger. I was told he was okay; they couldn't smell alcohol on him. He was probably tired from being out with business friends during the night. I voiced my concern of his wobbling; and his very slow movements and drifting off. I was told he was fine. The door was closed. During takeoff; he was loud trying to engage passenger in 1-A who feigned sleep. During service; he continually got up for the forward galley restroom but could not find the door; even trying the cockpit door. I stayed in the galley unless he was sleeping during most of the entire flight for security reasons. The B and C flight attendants were made aware of the situation. He continued his lavatory routine many times. At one point; he was returning to his seat and I heard a thud. He had fallen into the bulkhead row and was picking himself getting back to his seat. I asked if he was ok and he at first didn't respond. I asked again and he mumbled yes. I went back to fwd galley and I turned; he was right there backing me up saying he went to the doctor and had taken codeine and I had no right to ask him anything. I explained that I wanted to be sure he had not injured himself with the fall. He returned to his seat. He then shouted that he wanted my name. I stepped to the aisle and stated [my name]. He wanted my last name which I said we do not give out [last names] but [Company] has that info and knows who is working. He was upset. I turned to my galley and he jumped up and came at me with his phone and snapped my picture. I immediately asked him to delete it. He returned to his seat saying NO. I calmly told him that he cannot take a crew members picture without permission and he needed to delete it or have ground personnel meet the plane when we land. He refused. So I clearly stated; you are making the choice to have someone meet the aircraft because you are refusing to delete the picture. He just sat mumbling. The C Flight Attendant had come forward at that time and saw most of this. She then went back to take care of the cabin. I did tell her I was going to inform the Captain and ask for ground assistance. I did call the Captain; however; at that time; they were being diverted due to runway issues in ZZZ so he told me he would get back to me. I stayed in the galley waiting for the Captain to call. I was cleaning up when this passenger; who had been mumbling and talking most of this time; came up at me again; backing me up saying I was going down the wrong path with him. I firmly told him to sit down. The Captain called and informed the crew of the diversion and ZZZ issues. He asked about the passenger situation. I quickly gave a summary and asked for ground assistance. We diverted to ZZZ1. On landing; this passenger jumped up to get his bags saying he was leaving. Ops met the plane and police were quickly there along with ground Supervisor. I gave a statement to police. We received witness names and numbers along with a statement from a passenger who witnessed this passenger in [departure airport] in the gate area. This was given to police.Stop allowing passengers that are clearly under the influence of something to board. I don't know what else to say. These passengers are allowed and enabled. There should be no arguement or debate. If someone is asking if you have been drinking or taking medication; then it's a pretty good bet your behavior brought attention to you. Flight crew DOES look out for these issues. Our FAR states we cannot let them onboard. WE do not! We bring attention to the OPS agent or Supervisor or; our Captains; and then we are continually told 'they are fine' or 'they will sleep' or 'this is the last flight out'. Someone has to stop allowing this. Deny boarding; and stopenabling this behavior. Alcohol related issues are one of the biggest conversations among crew. [The passengers] expect ENDLESS alcohol. Drugs are unseen and are hard to detect but just as dangerous; and then you mix the two. Something has to be done to stop allowing this without there being serious consequences to the passenger! This situation has shown me just how vulnerable we are. I could have been physically hurt. I was trapped by this man. For the entire flight; I was on the highest alert in my head. My anxiety level hit me after we landed back in base. I am still having anxiety each time I have to file a report. My passengers could have been hurt. My Captain was busy with a last minute flight diversion due to runway issues in ZZZ; and had to acknowledge this situation. This puts everyone in harm's way. This man should NEVER have been ALLOWED on this aircraft. One of the witness statements was that he observed this man in [departure airport] and was shocked he was allowed on the aircraft at the very last minute. 74 people were trapped at 35K with him.

While at cruise at 35;000 ATC called and requested that we slow to Mach .76. At that same time; we encountered moderate turbulence. While reading back the Mach .76 call; I requested lower to smooth air. ATC then said that it was smooth at 31;000 but to descend to 33;000 for now. I started descending to 33;000 via level change. When descending through 33;500 ATC then asked if we were on frequency. I replied that we were and he had literally just slowed us and cleared us to descend to 33;000. At that point; the controller said to maintain 35;000 and turn right 20 degrees. I started a climb back to 35;000 and a turn. Realizing the situation and that the automation was not moving fast enough; I clicked off the autopilot and auto thrust and turned and climbed back to 35;000. Once level; ATC seemed confused about the clearance but fortunately we had an additional pilot in the jump seat and we all clearly heard the clearance and call sign. I told ATC that fact and he was extremely apologetic realizing what had happened. During the event; both the jump seater and I noticed on the TCAS that we were within 100 feet of the other aircrafts altitude! At that point; we did not have the other aircraft in sight but shortly after; a [aircraft] went under our nose and left wing. Once clear of traffic; ATC then cleared us lower again and handed us off to the next controller. He again apologized and thanked us for our help. The end result is that we did not get a TCAS RA; but it was a close encounter. I believe had I left the automation on; it would have resulted in a RA or even worse!

As a result; he used the cockpit speaker to listen and kept hot MIC on.The sounds of breathing made it very difficult to understand what was being said. We deployed the speedbrakes and extended the landing gear (on speed) in order to increase our descent rate and expedite a landing at [the alternate]. I took over the radios while the Captain coordinated with the cabin crew. This allowed me to listen to and understand what ATC was saying. Next; the Captain ran the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Non-normal Checklist. While descending through FL270; we received a call from the cabin that a USB battery device was found to be the source of the smoke. It had been placed in the containment bag and was no longer smoking. They also indicated that the smoke was clearing out from the cabin. We elected to level off near FL250 and await confirmation that the situation was safe. With this confirmation received; we removed our oxygen masks and reviewed the remainder of the [procedure] per QRH guidance. We elected to cancel the [divert]; climb; and continue to [destination]. The Captain gave a PA explaining the situation and that we were continuing to the destination. A non-Company FA (Flight Attendant) was onboard and assisting our Flight Attendants with the situation. Being a fluent Spanish speaker; she also repeated all of the Captain's PAs in Spanish; which was extremely helpful in keeping the customers calm. We asked that [ground personnel] meet us at the gate to inspect the containment bag. Additionally; EMS was requested because one of our FAs had received an injury to her hand while securing the device. A normal landing ensued and our aircraft was escorted to the gate by [ground personnel]. With the device in the aft galley area still secure in the containment bag; we decided to deplane the customers. Once this was accomplished; the Fire Crew tended to the containment bag while EMS attended the injured FA who was treated briefly. We were given the 'all clear' by the Fire Crew and the event was concluded. This situation was successfully handled because of the professionalism and teamwork demonstrated by our crew. Our Flight Attendants (including the other airline FA) reacted quickly and assertively. Because of their actions; this flight had a successful outcome. Our situation was clearly mitigated by the containment bag. Without it; we would have diverted and emergency egressed at [the alternate].Difficulty that we encountered in the cockpit was an inability to communicate clearly with the oxygen masks on. The Captain's mask would not fit over his headset; so it was quickly shed and communication was established by use of the speaker and hot mike. This technique works well in the simulator however; in the airplane; descending rapidly with the landing gear down; there was too much background noise mixed with regulator sounds to allow easy communication. In hindsight; a better technique would have been to not use the speaker; but put the headphones on over the mask straps. Additionally; only using the yoke push to talk interphone switch when speaking would have also reduced the noise level in the cockpit and on the radios.",,,,"B737-700 First Officer reported initiating; then terminating a diversion for smoke in the cabin and difficulty with flight deck communication using oxygen masks.",

They asked if they should reset them; and I told them definitely not to. We checked the cockpit circuit breakers; which were all normal. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them know about the circuit breakers and asked them to pass it along to Maintenance Control. Just prior to descent; we smelled a strong sulfury odor in the cockpit that dissipated after about a minute. We had the same odor a few minutes later. At this point; we thought that it was someone in the lavatory. The flight attendants called us to let us know that they also smelled it; but that there was no one in the lavatory. The smell was gone again shortly; so I told them to keep us informed. By the third time that we had the smell; I asked them to see if someone could have a colostomy bag or if there was an obvious source that could be the cause. They said that the passengers in the front rows of the airplane all thought that someone had bad gas. They checked and said that there was no bag. I asked; but at this point it did not smell like any type of a fire to them. I asked them to try to isolate the location of the smell and to check for smoke. At this point we were about twenty minutes from landing. At about 12;000 feet on the arrival; the flight attendants called to tell me that the odor was strongest at about row 10; there was no obvious smoke; and the passengers in the forward cabin all had their noses covered. They said that they now smelled an electrical burning smell at row 10. I asked if they all agreed with this; and they all did believe it was electrical. I had transferred control of the airplane to the First Officer to fly the arrival and approach as we were now descending through about 8000 feet. We let Approach Control know that we were [requesting priority] and would like to have emergency personnel standing by at the runway to check for any obvious smoke. We were immediately cleared for the approach and cleared to land. I ran the 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes' checklist as we configured for the approach. After we finished the checklist; I quickly informed the flight attendants of what would happen once we landed. We landed and cleared the runway to hold on [the] intersection. I informed the passengers that we were going to have a fire truck inspect the aircraft due to the odor on the airplane out of an abundance of caution. Fire Personnel did an inspection of the aircraft and saw no smoke or hot spots on the aircraft. At this point; we had no odors in the aircraft and had not since we had run the QRH checklist. We asked them to follow us to the gate so that we could deplane the passengers and have them inspect the interior of the aircraft. I made another PA to the passengers to let them know that everything was fine and safe; and that they would see the fire trucks as they followed us to the gate.At the gate; I quickly spoke with Dispatch to let her know what was going on and that I would call back once we had deplaned and inspected the airplane. We deplaned the passengers as I spoke with the Fire Personnel in the jetway; and they said that they still saw no hot spots on the aircraft but would inspect the cabin. At this point; our A Flight Attendant let me know that both of the forward galley circuit breakers had popped at some point and that all of the water had drained out of the potable water tank. The passengers all seemed happy and no one seemed concerned. We saw no evidence of a fire in the airplane and there was no remaining odor. I spoke with my Crew to make sure that they were okay to continue on our next flight and then had a conference call with Dispatch and a Chief Pilot. I also spoke with Maintenance Control to explain what had happened. The aircraft was taken out of service; and I made a logbook entry and stayed with Maintenance until he let me know that Company was sending Mechanics.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B737-800 flight crew reported sulfur and burning electrical odors in the cabin.",

It showed Aircraft Y level at FL360; head on with our track at our altitude. Unbeknownst to us; a TCAS circuit breaker had tripped prior to this event; causing it to not generate any aural warnings for traffic. It took both of us a moment or two to process what was happening due to no aural alerts. I immediately executed the TCAS RA escape maneuver and initiated a shallow descent per the green VSI indications. We descended approximately 200 feet and Aircraft Y executed a rapid climb. We cleared each other by 1100 feet as we crossed each other. The controller implied that Aircraft Y had overly delayed their climb to FL370. I queried ATC about the clearance Aircraft Y had and received no response; as if the incident never happened.

Police Officers and TSA came onto the plane looking for evidence and could not find anything. When we deplaned the aircraft we stayed in the gate area while on the phone with Operations. In the gate area; we noticed the passenger shaking the police officers hand and walking away. As he was walking away; he dropped the vape pen on the ground and picked it up. We notified the police and they detained him. The police tested the vape pen and it tested positive for THC (marijuana).

I checked his ID to make sure he was of age and said no problem. As I was taking the next rows order; he interrupts me asking where to buy the snacks. I explained to him we'd be around shortly with pretzels as our snack option. As I went back to taking orders; he interrupts me again asking if he could use the lavatory. I explained to him the seatbelt sign was on and I was not able to give him permission as long as the seatbelt sign was illuminated. At this point; I finished taking orders and waited behind the B Flight Attendant as she finished taking her last row of orders. Passenger apparently got up right after I informed him the seatbelt sign was on because I felt a hard tap on my shoulder of him explaining he had to use the bathroom. I told him politely that we both needed to wait until she was done taking her last order. At this point; I informed the B of unusually behavior from him. As I was pouring drinks and the B was putting pretzels in the snack basket; the passenger came bolting out of the lavatory; leaving the door wide open. As I went to close the door; the B and I both realized he smelled strongly of marijuana. I walked into the lavatory and smelled an even greater odor of marijuana. There is no doubt in my mind at this point; that the passenger was smoking weed in the bathroom. We went up to talk to the A; called the Captain and all decided that we needed police assistance upon landing. We also decided to monitor the passenger. Passenger appeared paranoid and edgy as he watched us call the Captain and watched each of us every time we walked by. Upon landing; police met him and questioned him.

We held for 1 hour. All runways were closed and nil to poor braking was reported. After the 1 hour holding delay we were cleared for the approach to ILS10 C. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and our fuel status and our options. We confirmed our plan with dispatch and decided to continue to ZZZ. On the first approach; we were vectored off to give spacing with a heavy international 787. After a delaying vectors we were once again recleared for the approach. We were assigned a speed of 160 knots 15 miles from the runway. We complied. Approximately 1 mile from the field; the Tower instructed us to go around due to loss of separation. We went around and stated we were now in a minimum fuel state and could except no more delays. ATC vectored us back for a second approach. The weather had deteriorated more to 1/2 mile visibility and slush covered runway at reported depth of 1/8 inch completely covered. We opted to perform a flaps 40 Cat 2 autoland per the approach plate. On the second approach at approximately 300 ft. from touchdown; the Tower instructed us to immediately go-around stating the preceding airplane had slid off the runway. We performed a second go around and immediately diverted to ZZZ1. We were at our minimum fuel and decided that was the safest course of action. We did a 3rd low IFR ILS Autoland into ZZZ1 and it was uneventful. We contacted Crew Scheduling about what they wanted us to do. Their first plan was for us to refuel and fly back to ZZZ. We stated that we thought we were close to the end of our duty day. Scheduling then said that they wanted us to sit on the plane and wait for a possible inbound crew then deadhead to ZZZ. The First Officer and I discussed this and decided it was best to get some crew rest at that point due to the long and very difficult flight we encountered. We felt we were extremely exhausted and not functioning with very clear thought process and our communication skills were degraded. We decided that to layover at ZZZ1 was a safer option.

As we passed through 10;000 feet; they began to smell an odor of alcohol and nail polish remover that made them feel uneasy. As they came forward to inform the A and C (FWD) flight attendants; these flight attendants confirmed to them that they had a similar feeling on the way to ZZZ; but did not share that with anyone else. I followed our QRH for fume removal and the odor did not dissipate; but remained mild while in cruise for the remainder of the flight. I had the AFT flight attendants come forward to the cockpit and administered oxygen. This had the desired effect and they both started to feel better. I had them stay in the forward galley for the remainder of the flight. As we started our descent into ZZZ1; I asked them to return to the AFT galley and [let] me know if the odor changed in intensity. Within in few minutes; they called to inform me that the smell was intensifying and that they were again becoming disoriented. At this time; the passengers; starting with those seated in the last rows; started to complain about the odor and quickly the rest of the plane began to complain.  I told the flight attendants to leave the AFT galley and to take a seat in the cabin for the remainder of the flight. Hence; they were not in their safety positions on landing.It appears there was deice fluid trapped in the airplane that may have caused the event and as the airplane pitch attitude changed; so did the trap fluid.

We received a further clearance to descend to 8000 ft and go direct ZZZZZ. I inserted the direct and pulled for open descent. Step 2 of the QRH did not apply. Step 3 says if engines stalls; go to the engine shutdown procedures. So as a precaution; we found and reviewed this checklist in the QRH.

I gave control of the airplane to the FO and then called the flight attendants and advised them of the situation making sure they understood it would be a normal landing and we would taxi to the gate. I also quickly told the passengers so no one would be surprised by the emergency vehicles on landing. I took the airplane back; the FO told [ATC] we would need the emergency equipment and asked them to advise [our company] of the situation. All of this occurred very quickly. We descended to 3000 feet and were given vectors for a short approach. I flew the ILS XXL with the No1 engine in idle following single engine approach guidelines. We landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate. The No1 engine ran smoothly at idle the whole time and we shut it down at the gate using normal procedures.",,,,"A319 Captain reported the Number 1 engine developed a compressor vane problem and was only producing idle power.

We looked at the Hydraulic Panel on the Forward Overhead Panel and noted ENG 1 LOW PRESSURE light was illuminated. We then looked at our MFD (Multi Functional Display) System on Lower Display Unit and noted quantity in the Hydraulic A system read 21%. I was pilot monitoring and told the First Officer to continue to fly and take over communications while I referenced the QRH. I followed checklist for Hydraulic Pump Low Pressure; which led us to turning off the ENG 1 Hydraulic Pump switch. We continued to monitor the quantity and noted that it was continuing to decrease at a decent rate. I told the First Officer of my intentions to [advise ATC] before the situation deteriorated and he agreed with my assessment. We [advised] ATC and flew direct to ZZZ. I notified Dispatch of our situation and briefed flight attendants. In anticipation of possibly losing System A we reviewed the 'LOSS OF SYSTEM A' QRH checklist. I referenced the Non-Normal Configuration Landing Distance table and asked Dispatch to also provide me a value to check against my calculation; and the values agreed. Again; this was just preparation in case we lost System A.Eventually; our quantity indicated 0%; but we still had good pressure in the system with no other warning or caution lights. Once communications had been completed and QRH checklists run and reviewed; I again took over ATC communications. We briefed the approach and again reviewed our plan if we lost system A. Except for indicating no quantity in system A; but still with good pressure; we had a normal descent and approach. We lowered gear and flaps earlier than we would normally; considering the possibility that the increased demand on the system could lead to a loss of pressure. When we lowered the gear; we noted quantity increased to 20%; where it stayed for the entirety of flight. We had an uneventful landing and taxi into the gate. We debriefed with local Maintenance. We also debriefed our performance. We felt we maintained safety; managed the emergency well; followed standard procedures; communicated and considered possibilities if the situation deteriorated and how we would handle those situations.",,,,"B737 Captain reported main hydraulic system malfunction during cruise.",

Approximately 3-5 minutes later the Captain called to ask if we had noticed a rapid descent. We confirmed that we had noticed a change in cabin pressure because our ears had popped. The Captain said we had just experienced a depressurization but the cabin altitude never got high enough for the masks to drop and they decided not to deploy them manually or make a public address to inform the passengers what was going on. In this the Captain assumed we were fine because we had not figured out we were experiencing hypoxia.Several minutes later all 7 crewmembers were experiencing various symptoms of hypoxia. Taking all of this into account I decided it would be advisable to administer oxygen. Flight Attendant 5 contacted the flight deck to advise them that we had used an O2 bottle and get clarification on what was going on. The Captain took the initiative to contact paramedics to meet us at the gate. It was also in that moment that the Captain told us we 'shouldn't be experiencing these symptoms;' giving us the impression that he was negating our symptoms.Upon our arrival into ZZZ we discovered further miscommunication occurred when the paramedics gave us the impression they were told to expect many passengers being ill and that we had experienced a rapid decompression. The Captain then pulled all of us aside for a discussion of what had happened. He then explained that an air conditioning pack had overheated and went inoperative. He said that the remaining air conditioning pack was failing to keep the cabin pressure pressurized and that they were alerted to don O2 masks when the cabin pressure reached 10;000 feet. He said the cabin pressure never got above 12;000 feet and that's why the masks never dropped. He then told us the event was called a 'controlled loss of cabin pressure'. An abrupt departure from his earlier term of 'depressurization.'4 of the 7 crew members chose to be evaluated by paramedics and declined transport to a hospital. The concern of the entire cabin crew was that the flight deck failed to inform us of what was going on when it was occurring and chose to wait until several minutes after the fact to let us know what happened. Our concern lies in the fact that in failing to inform us of what was happening we were not given the opportunity to take appropriate measures; such as being seated or donning oxygen as a precautionary measure. Additionally; the crew is concerned that in reporting our symptoms; the Captain's words and actions invalidated our concerns by telling us 'that shouldn't be happening'. Additionally; the crew is concerned that this is the 3rd reported cabin pressure issue with this particular tail number [in four months] and that this tail is still in service. We cannot perform our functions as safety professionals if we are not properly communicated with by the flight crew and are allowed to work on an aircraft that has known pressurization issues.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported lack of oxygen and a feeling of hypoxia and that the pilot advised that they; 'shouldn't be experiencing these symptoms.'",

After running the QRH; I handed the aircraft to my First Officer and had him fly the remainder of the flight due to my limited visibility. We notified ATC and [advised them] and told the controllers we wanted to turn back to ZZZ; slow down and descend to 10;000 in case of loss of pressurization.

I looked at the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) display; but there wasn't a target where I thought the traffic should be. At approximately 7;000 feet; we got a Resolution Advisory telling us to descend; followed by another telling us to increase descent rate. The FO (First Officer) complied with the RA (Resolution Advisory) and performed the descending maneuver. The TCAS display showed an aircraft right on our nose within 100 feet vertically. I called ATC and informed them we were descending in response to an RA. We descended approximately 1;000 feet during which time the TCAS continued to command a descent. After that 1;000 feet; the TCAS commanded Climb/Climb Now. The FO complied with the climb RA command. The target on the display continued to show an aircraft on our nose within 100 feet; and we began to realize that our TCAS system was more than likely malfunctioning.

The entire crew arrived early; (1 hour prior to departure) introduced ourselves; and talked about the flight. We briefed security; weather; MELs; and most importantly safety. Boarding was uneventful. The weather in ZZZ1 was a 1/4 sm and VV002. We asked Dispatch for an ALT as there wasn't one on our release. We also had to remove an additional MEL on our release that was previously cleared by Maintenance. We ended up leaving 13 minutes late waiting for a printed out 2nd release. Pushing back I asked my First Officer (FO) to start engine Number 1. He started engine Number 1 while I monitored the push and talked to the ground crew. The FO immediately brought to my attention the large plume of smoke coming from the engine during the start sequence. All engine parameters were within limits. After the start there were no unusual smells or indications. We attributed the smoke to a possible over-spray of deice fluid onto the engine (not uncommon); as well as it was the first flight of the day; and it was cold outside. We taxied out on 1 engine per suggested procedures via spot XX to runway 34R. In sequence for takeoff engine Number 2 was started and the APU was shutdown. We ran all appropriate checklist. There were no abnormal instrument indications. There were no fumes or unusual odors prior to flight. I was the Pilot Flying this particular leg. Taking off Runway XXR was uneventful until acceleration altitude. Shortly after I brought the thrust levers back from takeoff to climb detent; I noticed an unusual smell. It was very light at first. I asked my FO if he could smell anything. He initially couldn't smell anything different than normal. We were extremely busy on the departure and cleaning up the aircraft. We were handed off to Departure and were told to make a left turn which was opposite of the departure procedure. It was somewhere around this time that my First Officer told me that he could smell something as well. It was faint at first and not distinguishable. The odor grew stronger and began to irritate my throat. If I had to choose it was more chemically than the musty sock smell. I had my First Officer don his O2 mask and call the back to see if they had anything unusual to report. I continued to fly the plane and was handling the radios. I turned the AP1 on at this time to reduce the workload and focus on the fume problem. The Flight Attendants (FAs) had nothing to report. We told them to let us know if anything changed. We began to troubleshoot the problem turning the bleed fans to high. It seemed to me that the smell was dissipating as time progressed. Initially I thought it was one of those smells that come and go just as fast. A good example of this is a familiar smell flying through the thin layer going into ZZZ2. We had FA B come forward to the cockpit to give us a second opinion on whether the odor was still lingering. When she came upfront she immediately noticed the smell. I had a conversation with her I'm a bit foggy as to everything she or I said. I do remember FA B saying it hurt her throat. She left the cockpit and I donned my O2 mask. I don't recall the exact amount of time or altitude this all transpired as we were obviously busy and the aircraft was light and climbing fast. I did occasionally remove it for a few seconds to see if the smell dissipated. After FA B left; we discussed the QRH and whether or not to return to ZZZ. My throat was pretty sore; I felt light headed; and we both had O2 mask on. The safest thing to do was return to ZZZ. The First Officer made the request to ATC [and] they gave us an altitude and heading. They asked if we were requesting priority handling. My First Officer acknowledged with FOB; SOB; and the nature of our situation. I called the back and told our Flight Attendants that we [notified ATC] and were returning to the field because of the fumes in the cockpit. I was talking through the O2 mask and I believe I said there weren't going to be any PAs explaining everything to the passengers from us. The FO called the company enlightened them on our situation and got us a gate. I was pretty foggy at this point even with the O2 mask on. My throat hurt and I was coughing. My First Officer conveyed that he felt better than I did and offered to be Flying Pilot. I transferred controls to my FO to be the Flying Pilot. ATC gave us direct ZZZ and eventually cleared us to land for Runway XXR. I ran the checklist and handled the radios. The First Officer did a flawless approach and landing. We exited the runway and taxied at a steady pace to spot XX and cleared to gate XX. Arriving at the gate we had no rampers and the spot was blocked by a row of baggage carts. I had both engines running and every light on to hopefully get everyone's attention. Still having my oxygen mask on I opened my window stuck my head out and waved rapidly at the rampers at the next gate over. They saw me and quickly came over to clear the area and parked us. We pulled in and shut down. Ran the checklist and opened the cockpit door. The emergency crews were already there. We collected our bags and followed the paramedics to the gate area where they evaluated us. The three of us all went to the hospital for further evaluation. We all tested positive for high CO levels in our blood. Looking back at the event; it seemed to me a few times that the odor was dissipating or gone. I felt that the conditions were the most toxic shortly after I reduced thrust from takeoff thrust. I realize today that I was completely acclimated to the odor and what I was sensing was inaccurate. Unlike an engine indication or a warning light there is no way for a pilot to definitely determine that the problem still exist with this particular fume event. I remember looking at the QRH saying 'but the odor is decreasing.' I've had several 'fume events' at this airline and each one unlike the first. The Flight Attendants did an excellent job. They understood the severity of the situation and passed the necessary information along quickly. We called them several times and they were very straight to the point and factual. When the cockpit door opened on the ground and we exited the aircraft not one passenger was standing. Without a doubt they had positive control on the cabin. FA B coming forward in helping us asses the cockpit fumes was crucial. She remained calm; told us the conditions in the back; and immediately went into what she smelled and how it was affecting her. I lastly want to commend my First Officer. He offered several solutions as what he thought the problem was. My FO did all that he could to keep the workload down and assist me as well as reminded me if something was missed. We did deal with the situation together. We were lucky that we had flown with each other for the last 3 days and understood one another. We kept the cockpit communication open and flowing. Finally after deciding to return to ZZZ my First Officer realized the condition I was in and offered to assume control of the aircraft. I agreed with him as that was the best decision. He has good character; makes the right decisions under pressure; and is a pleasure to fly with. He will make an excellent Line Captain. Maintenance returned the aircraft back to service after performing the cabin air troubleshoot form. They discovered deice fluid on the APU inlet. They deactivated the APU and returned to flight where the next crew had another fume event. I disagree with Maintenance's solution to the problem. We did not have the APU running when we had the problem for one. Secondly the chemical smell that I experienced wasn't the typical deice smell. Does boiling deice fluid produce CO? I'm not sure? I've had fume events before and the air filters were replaced. I see nothing in this report that the filters were checked or replaced. I've heard countless remarks from Maintenance on the line that we are using different oil in our APU and not changing ourair filters regularly. What happened to the carbon filters that we were getting? What happened to Maintenance running the bleed on the ramp to high temperatures for burn off procedures like [other airline]? This is my 3rd fume event. This is too common of an occurrence and the only way to prevent this is by actually cleaning the bleed systems; changing the air filters regularly; and tracking the aircraft fume events between airlines.",,"Flight was our first flight of the day and the fourth and final day of our trip. It was also the first flight for the aircraft after remaining overnight in ZZZ. The inbound flight arrived in ZZZ at approximately XA00 local the same day. Upon arriving to the aircraft; I noted a 'Pre-Deicing Notification' form on the center pedestal indicating Type I de-ice fluid had been applied to the wings and tail. I also took note that maintenance had likely been at the aircraft as both L/R engine oil quantities were indicating 18.5 quarts. All three hydraulic reservoirs were at or near the top of their respective scales as indicated on the system synopsis pages. I performed the outside pre-flight inspection and did not note any physical damage or abnormalities. I did notice a medium quantity of residual de-ice fluid on the lower portion of the main landing gear assemblies as well as the main tires.We were cleared to push-back. At some point past the hold point; Captain asked for the #1 engine to be started. I started the #1 engine and because we were still being pushed back; I noticed a large plume of black smoke on the left side of the aircraft. I commented to Captain that it seemed larger than normal. I continued to monitor the Engine Warning Display during start and the engine start sequence completed with no abnormal indications. We proceeded to Runway XXR on one engine. While in sequence for takeoff; I started the #2 engine and shut down the APU with no abnormal indications. We ran the appropriate checklists and awaited takeoff clearance. No abnormal odors or fumes were detected before takeoff. The initial takeoff from XXR was uneventful up until approximately 1;000 ft MSL when Captain asked if I could smell an odor. Initially I could not. Due to the cold temperature in ZZZ; I had all of my vents and the eyeball air vent on my side closed. I opened the eyeball vent on my side and adjusted it to point towards me; I immediately noticed an odd odor. The odor was not of a smoke or burning nature; so I was not overly concerned initially. We were still in the initial climb phase and my attention was quickly diverted to our ATC handoff from Tower to Approach. We had also reached acceleration altitude [and] I completed the After Takeoff checklist. Upon check-in with Approach; they gave us a left turn HDG 270 which was the opposite direction of the RNAV SID we were assigned. Captain and I confirmed the heading and at some point during the left turn I noticed he was coughing and indicated his throat was hurting. He asked that I don my oxygen mask to get some fresh air for a few seconds and then remove it to see if I noticed the odor and could gauge how strong it was. I donned my mask and took several deep breathes. I then pulled the mask a few inches away [from] my face and noticed a very strong odor. I donned the mask again and ensured it was well sealed. I then chimed the forward flight attendant (I may have even chimed both forward and aft attendants - I cannot recall) and asked if she noticed any unusual smell. She indicated she had not noticed anything. During this period we were cleared to climb to a higher altitude; I believe 15;000 ft. With less than 100 passengers and 21;000 lbs of fuel; we were climbing very quickly. Captain then suggested we get a third nose up front and get their opinion. He chimed the forward attendant and asked one of them to immediately block while the other enter the Flight Deck. [The Flight Attendant] entered the flight deck and immediately noticed the odor. While Captain and [the Flight Attendant] were talking; I was focused on the aircraft navigation and climb state. I recall her saying she used to be a Ground De-ice Coordinator and was very familiar with the smell of both liquid and burning glycol. She indicated it did not smell like glycol. After a very short period of time she indicated a burning sensation in the lower portion of her throat. The Captain asked that she return to her seat. Once [theFlight Attendant] had exited the flight deck; Captain and I briefed on the current state of the aircraft (navigation and altitude assigned). I believe it was at this point he donned his oxygen mask and we agreed a return to ZZZ was the best course of action. He called the flight attendants and indicated we were returning to ZZZ. I mentioned the 'Elimination of Foul Odors in Flight Deck and Cabin' QRH checklist and Captain began to run it as I advised ATC of our intention to return to ZZZ; programmed the MCDU (Multifunction Control Display Unit) for the ILS XXL; obtained current ATIS; and sent for Landing Performance Data. ATC asked us if we were [requesting priority handling] and I acknowledged with SOB (Souls Onboard) and fuel. At this point we were at approximately FL250. ATC cleared us to descend to approximately 16;000 ft and we initiated a descent. ATC then gave us a left turn and cleared us direct to ZZZ. Since I had already loaded the ILS XXL approach into the MCDU; I advised ATC we were proceeding direct to ZZZZZ; a fix outside the FAF on the ILS XXL. I still had the Company Ops frequency dialed into COM2; I called Ops and advised we would be returning and requested a gate. They must have already known we were headed back as they quickly assigned XX. I also sent an ACARS message to our Flight Dispatcher indicating we were returning to ZZZ due to a strong fume/odor. We completed the approach checklist and continued our descent. We were later assigned Runway XXR; I made the change in the MCDU and we proceeded direct ZZZZZ1 on the ILS XXR. At some point; approximately 20 miles from ZZZZZ1; I could tell Captain was feeling much worse than I was. He was coughing frequently and indicated numerous times he felt light-headed and his throat was burning. I advised that I felt okay to fly and could take over as PF (Pilot Flying) if he wanted me to. He agreed that would be best and transferred aircraft control to me. The final approach and landing on XXR was uneventful and Captain proceeded to briskly taxi to the gate as I completed the after landing checklist. As we rounded the corner past Spot XY; I called out a vehicle and four baggage carts that were directly blocking our path to the jet bridge. There were a few ground service folks standing around and they did not seem to be in much of a hurry until Captain opened his side window and leaned out; with oxygen mask still on; motioning the ground service personnel to move the vehicles out of the way. The airport fire trucks following us may have also come into view and caused the ground service personnel to expeditiously move the vehicles blocking our path. This wasted a solid two to three minutes. We arrived at the gate; shut down; and completed the parking checklist. As Captain exited the flight deck to speak with the flight attendants and meet the paramedics; I ran through the after landing and parking checklists one more time to ensure I had not missed anything. As I was waiting for external power to be plugged into the aircraft; one of our mechanics entered the flight deck and advised that he would take control of the aircraft and we could leave everything as-is. One of the airport firefighters entered the flight deck with a handheld device that I assume was to take readings of gaseous components or maybe it was an infrared camera to look for a potential fire. I never heard the results of the test. We collected our bags and followed the paramedics up to the gate area where we were evaluated before being transported to the hospital.Post Event Notes:Knowing de-ice fluid was sprayed on the aircraft; an odor was not unexpected nor unfamiliar. I am familiar with the smell of glycol in the bleed system and have experienced it many times in the past on various aircraft. The odor on our flight was; in my opinion; not glycol related. I have also experienced the dirty sock/locker room odor in the past and while this was somewhat similar; I would not attribute what was experienced during this event to that particular odor. It also did not seem like an odor that would come from engine exhaust and certainly not the type from an electrical fire. I cannot recall ever experiencing the smell of a phosphate ester fluid; such as hydraulic fluid; coming in contact with a very hot surface; so am unsure if it was similar. The best I can describe the odor we experienced is a pungent chemical smell; and a strong one at that. Of the three of us that were sickened by the noxious odor; I think I experienced the symptoms to the lesser degree. That can possibly be explained by donning my mask the soonest; my age; my overall fitness level; and of course the fact that everyone's body reacts differently.I feel very lucky to have been flying with Captain when this event occurred. Having had flown together for the previous three days only helped. I feel that we exercised great CRM and were able to non-verbally read each other well. We both had an extra ear out for each other during the whole event and filled in or reminded one another when something was missed. Captain demonstrated exceptional leadership skills throughout the entire flight and that is to be commended. Decisions were made on a joint basis; he kept our flight attendants informed; and most importantly; he was never shy about stating his overall condition. This allowed us the ability to make the best decisions with the greatest amount of information available.TRACON was an excellent resource and gave us whatever we requested. I imagine we were on a discrete frequency at one point because I remember the radio chatter being very minimal until being handed off to the tower; that was appreciated.One thing that surprised me a bit was how loud the audio through the speakers was from the oxygen masks. Even after turning the intercom and radio volume knobs all the way up so I could hear Captain and ATC better; it only made the extremely loud sound of the oxygen flowing worse and was distracting. I considered moving my intercom switch to the off position to silence the sound of oxygen flowing but did not want to have to move the switch every time I wanted to talk through the intercom. We were simply too busy for that.Recommendations:Starting both engines; and thereby shutting down the APU; after pushback could potentially reduce the likeliness of introducing any new odors into the bleed system shortly before takeoff. Not sure if this would have changed anything we experienced. It was very frustrating arriving to the gate only to find ground service vehicles blocking the safety area with ground service personnel just standing around. I advised station operations in excess of ten minutes prior to our return and feel they could and should have ensured the safety area was clear and personnel were standing by to marshal us in expeditiously. We did have a jet bridge operator and that was appreciated.The single most frustrating and disappointing part of this event occurred after I was released from the hospital and was working on getting myself home. I called Scheduling to ensure they were up to speed on the situation and confirm I was released from duty. I requested that they positive space me home; from ZZZ to ZZZ1. They said they could only deadhead me to my base. I then called my Chief Pilot; and asked for his help. He was happy to call Scheduling and make the request. He reported back to me that despite his best efforts; Scheduling would not do it out of fear that a grievance would be filed. I offered to state on a recorded phone line with scheduling that I would not file a grievance for the company sending me home. It is sad and disappointing the folks in Scheduling could not think big picture and consider the circumstances to 'Do the Right Thing.' I would like to suggest an MOU or side-letter be drafted between the company and [the union] to ensure crewmembers can be positive spaced home if certain circumstances are met.

During takeoff flight deck door inadvertently opened. I was working C position and strapped into my jumpseat. When this event happened. I quickly turned and attempted to shut [the] door even though it was physically impossible to do so at takeoff speeds and initial climb ( being it is a steel reinforced door and extremely heavy at that point during flight). I did my best at what I was trained to do; protecting flight deck from a possible breach; while holding the door closed to a point until I could get out of my jumpseat to actually close it. In the process; I was hurt by the strain on my left side of my body (arm; shoulder and neck) at that particular angle being strapped in for my safety during takeoff. I did not know the extent of my injury until a few hours later as my neck and shoulder region began to swell up due to the strain. I did seek medical treatment via company afterwards later in the day as my trip was over. Our B flight attendant claimed that this was not the first time experiencing the MAX 8 door inadvertently opening during takeoff. This was my first experience. My concern is are people reporting this. Is this a possible problem with the MAX 8. I personally can not claim human error or equipment problem. But worth investigating to ensure safety of flight crew as this could be a possible security breach in the worst case scenario. There is no protocol for an inadvertent flight deck door opening during takeoff in our manual; so I did what I instinctively knew. protect flight deck from a possible breach. In the meantime I did get hurt in this event as it is truly difficult to close that door at takeoff while strapped in the forward jumpseat. I want to bring light to this subject in what is the right thing to do in this event.",,,,"B737 MAX Flight Attendant reported incurring a minor injury while attempting to close the flight deck door when it opened during takeoff.",

The CA (Captain) queried her for more specifics (related to identifying type of odor) and they agreed to monitor for changes. The CA and I reviewed the 'odors' flight ops bulletin and discussed the potential of a developing fumes event. After a few minutes the 'A' reported an increase in intensity with eye irritation. We decided that this was likely a fumes event and proceeded to run the 'fumes' checklist from the QRH; selecting Pack 2 off as we had no indication or any fumes in the cockpit. We also advised Dispatch of a potential need to divert and discussed ZZZ or ZZZ1 as possible choices. Dispatch advised ZZZ as closest (which we already knew). After the required 5 minute interval the CA queried the FA and she reported the condition had worsened. We then switched pack configuration per the QRH with Pack 2 on and Pack 1 off. Just before that 5 minute interval ended the FA reported continued worsening with fumes now affecting the passengers in the first few rows of the cabin. We made the decision to divert to ZZZ. The CA advised ATC. As I was already the Pilot Flying the CA had me continue as such and gave me the radio communication duties as well so that he could coordinate better handle the growing non-flying duties. ATC gave us priority handling and the remainder of the descent and landing was uneventful. Emergency equipment was offered and I accepted as well as requesting EMTs to be waiting at the gate. After landing we decided the fumes were not at a critical level so we continued to clear the runway and proceeded to the gate. We had not received any gate confirmation and were unable to contact station ops on the radio so the CA decided to proceed to our 'normal' gate and after a few minutes delay station personnel arrived. We asked all passengers to deplane and the EMTs met/treated FAs and passengers as needed. We at no time noticed any fumes on the flight deck during the entire event. Suggestions: fume event as described. We diverted to a low use station and were lucky station personnel happened to be there. Dispatch should have offered more suggestions for possible divert choices based on operational factors other than closest airport. In hindsight; ZZZ1 was probably a better choice and not any further away (time wise) as we were too high/close to descend straight in to ZZZ. Also; we were unable to contact station ops once on the ground. In my experience; this has been an ongoing system wide systemic problem and in my opinion one day our collective luck will run out.",,"During cruise flight at FL370 I received a call from our A Flight Attendant (FA) informing me she smelled a smoky burning smell by the L1 door and in that general vicinity of the aircraft. She had confirmed it with another FA and while they could not identify the source it was prevalent. I inquired about the possibility of fume/odor event and initially; having experienced several of these type events herself; the A FA believed it was not that kind of smell. I told her my FO (First Officer) and I would discuss it and review some procedures and get back to her in a few minutes but for her to keep me posted on events in the cabin. I looked at the Navigation Display and determined we could divert to ZZZ or ZZZ1 as they were up ahead just in case things took a turn for the worse. My FO and I then reviewed the memo on odor decision making tools and the QRH for odor/fume event. We discussed the possibility of setting up a bathroom break to check the cabin for ourselves. I also sent a message to Dispatch giving them a heads up about the possible situation. About that time our A FA called back and informed us the smell was getting worse; it was now a smell typical of fume events; and confirmed by another FA experiencing symptoms such as burning eyes; difficulty breathing; etc. I informed her we would be diverting to ZZZ and to keep me posted. We continued to run through the QRH procedure in the cockpit which we completed; [notified] ATC and diverted to ZZZ where we landed without incident. During the descent the A FA called me several times with updates that the smell continued to get worse and that passengers were getting sick in the first few rows. The smell appeared to be isolated to the first few rows of the aircraft but during the descent it began to permeate the entire aircraft. I told her to do whatever she needed to do to take care of herself and the passengers and FAs. Once we arrived at gate XX in ZZZ passengers were informed to deplane and to seek medical attention with paramedics who were waiting in the terminal if they felt it was necessary. Suggestions: while there are certainly a number of lessons I learned from this event there's one thing of importance which I want to mention here and will pass on to various company officials and it's in regards to guidance received from Operations Control. As I mentioned; when I first learned of this event possibility I sent a message to Dispatch as a heads up. I received a message back telling us ZZZ was a better diversion point than ZZZ1 as it was closer. In that sense I'd agree. But what we didn't know and had no way of knowing if there weren't going to be any [company] people available in ZZZ to meet the flight! After we had deplaned we conversed with the ZZZ station manager who informed us we were 'lucky' they happened to be there. [Company] has no operations in ZZZ during that time of day and it's only by happenstance (the actual reason I can't remember) that anyone at all was there to work the flight when we arrived. In fact; we had to wait a few minutes for people to show up (we had received a message from Dispatch they were notifying ZZZ of our arrival). So in other words; we could have arrived in ZZZ with an aircraft expecting support and been left stuck out on the ramp with nowhere to go and plane load of people in need of medical attention. The ZZZ station manager informed us that ZZZ1 has a full service operation all day and would have been a better place for us to divert. Now; I'm not trying to throw our Dispatcher under the bus here and I'm not blaming him for anything at all. But it seems that ZZZ wasn't that much further and that's the kind of information the Operations Control should know and provide to us when we make our decisions. We the pilots had no clue about the station staffing situation and in a time compressed situation didn't really have time to contemplate the merits as such when our concern was getting the airplane on the ground and the people off the plane. ZZZ is a major city served by [company] and this could have been really ugly if we'd arrived with no station personnel to meet us. Anyway; just something to consider.",,"A320 flight crew reported Flight Attendant informed them of acrid odor in the forward cabin area. Flight crew executed a diversion due to fumes intensifying.",

Almost simultaneously at the rotate callout; there was a load bang heard just beneath the flight deck. First Officer (Pilot Flying) suspected a nosewheel tire blowout and elected to leave the landing gear down. Pilot Monitoring asked Tower if there was debris on the runway and they did confirm there was tire debris on the runway. We received vectors to the west and were assigned to hold at BLOND to burn fuel and to discuss a plan of action.We took off with 36;400 pounds of fuel; so we had over 20;000 pounds of fuel to burn to be under maximum landing weight. With the landing gear down; flaps 5 at 6;000 feet and 230 knots; it would have taken over 2 and a half hours of holding to burn the fuel. While holding; we discussed our plan with Dispatch to return to ZZZ. We elected to conduct a low approach at ZZZ to see if the Tower could verify which tire had failed; however; they were unable to see which tire had failed. We then returned to holding at BLOND to finalize our plan and to burn more fuel. In agreement with the Dispatcher and the [Chief Pilot]; we elected to accept an overweight landing on [Runway] 1L at ZZZ.  The plan was to make a full stop on the runway and have Crash Rescue assess the status of the aircraft and to have the aircraft towed from the runway to prevent any further damage to the nose gear or engines. The Captain (Pilot Monitoring) elected that he would land the aircraft due to the potential for loss of directional control since he had the tiller. The landing weight of the aircraft was 136;300 pounds and was an uneventful landing to a full stop with no loss of directional control. Crash Fire Rescue initially stated that they did not see anything wrong with the tire; however; we asked them to take a close look; at which time they noticed the right main tire was missing the tread. At this time; we shut down the engines and were towed from the runway to the pad where the passengers were offloaded onto buses and returned to the terminal. Upon inspection; the failed tire caused damage to some support brackets and wiring on the aft side of the nosewheel and the undercarriage of the aircraft had several dents from the tread that came off.",,"On takeoff (at rotation speed); we heard a loud thump coming from just below the flight deck. We suspected that we may have damage to the nose wheel and elected not to retract the landing gear. No other irregularities (engine or hydraulic) occurred. [Advised ATC] and we went into a holding pattern to coordinate with Dispatch and to brief the flight attendants and inform the passengers. In discussions with Dispatch; we agreed that a landing back at ZZZ would be the best (and safest) option. Before landing back at ZZZ; as an extra precaution; at 1;600 feet we went by the ZZZ Tower so that they might be able to assess the extent of the damage. The Tower could not determine the extent or if there was damage. Before returning back to airport for landing; we went back into the holding pattern to brief the approach; brief Flight Attendants; and to coordinate with Dispatch and ZZZ Ops with regards to ground handling of the aircraft and deplaning of Passengers. We made a soft touchdown on Runway XXL and stopped on the runway. The landing was uneventful and did not feel any unusual characteristics during roll out. The aircraft was met by CFR and ZZZ Maintenance. Maintenance determined there was damage to the right nose tire. The aircraft was towed to remote parking and all passengers were safely deplaned.

Checked the status page and the C HYD quantity was dropping quickly. Turned off the C HYD pumps without the checklist in attempt to stop the leak. Requested to level at 19;000 to diagnose. F/O [First Officer] took the flying and ATC duties and I worked with the IRO to accomplish checklists. The C HYD SYS PRESS EICAS was now illuminated. ATC was advised of our problem and provided delaying vectors. [Notified ATC.] We began with the C HYD QTY checklist; which was the initial alert we had gotten. That directed us to the to the C HYD SYS PRESS checklist. We read and accomplished that checklist. We concluded that continuing to ZZZ1 was not practical and a return was necessary. Dispatch contact was first via ACARS to quickly tell him of our loss of the C HYD SYS and our thoughts to return for landing. We also told him of our plan to dump about 10;000 lbs of fuel. Then a phone patch was established and we discussed all of the previous and perhaps landing at ZZZ2 for a longer runway. ZZZ XXL landing distance was only 8207 ft and the wind was a slight quartering tailwind when we took off. Dispatcher provided landing data for 22L [and] XXR. ATC offered XXR with the full ILS. With a calculated required landing distance of 5800 ft and XXR having 9560 ft available the winds were now a headwind the decision was made to land ZZZ XXR. Permission was given from Center to dump fuel. Dispatch was notified and we ran the fuel dumping checklist. Flight Attendants were now advised of the emergency. During the test briefing I told them a normal landing was planned and not to prep for evacuation but mentally review the procedures. The passenger announcement was now made. When the decision was made to return to ZZZ; [Center] ATC cleared us to hold at intersection on the ZZZZZ Arrival. We held for approximately another hour and a half to burn around 21;000 lbs of fuel to reach max landing weight of 350;000 lbs. During the hold time; Dispatcher continued to provide us with the necessary support by arranging emergency equipment; ATC priority and ZZZ Operations coordination. While in holding we reviewed the checklists several times and numerous check-in's were made with the flight attendants. At least one additional PA announcement. Left the hold at 350;000 lbs and accomplished the alternate gear and alternate flap extension checklists. A normal landing was made and with the reserve brakes and steering we were able to easily make the turnoff under our own power and taxi to gate. After block in a full cockpit and cabin crew debrief was performed. The deplaning passengers were very understanding and supportive of the safety decision to return. This flight attendant crew under the Purser XX_33 XX_21 was outstanding from the onset. It was their caring and attentive attitude that lead to a calm and cooperative demeanor of the passengers. This crew is a fine example of the true spirit the company strives for. A maintenance debrief was conducted. The technicians said the ADP was leaking. They asked us if we had conferenced with [Maintenance]. I had not considered this option because I felt that the loss of the C hydraulic SYS was a clear situation that continued ETOPS flight was not an option and the written checklists were precisely all the guidance we needed to conduct a safe flight. I debriefed only with the [Chief Pilot] as the Dispatch shift had changed. However; the Pilot/ Dispatcher communication and cooperation was textbook and exactly as you would expect it to be handled. In retrospect there are several takeaways for me from this experience. First is the false sense of time available. In our training environment; time and fuel are always critical resources. Usually once an emergency happens; it is resolved and you are back on the ground within 45 minutes. In this emergency we had just departed and the amount of fuel we had; created excess time available. There was no urgency to land or make hasty decisions. Despite this fact; I still think the mindset was to accomplish all tasks ASAP. As a result of this misconception; I think I chose to dump fuel early thinking it would expedite the landing. When in fact after the dump we still had to burn 20;000 lbs. I think a better decision would have been to hold off on this checklist and perform it at a later time and perhaps a different location. I still believe dumping the fuel was the right thing to do. It saved another hour of airborne holding which may have reduced some anxiety that the passengers may have been feeling. That all being said; everything did go like a training scenario. We all felt prepared and comfortable with the checklists and the duties required of us. This is truly a credit to our training center and all of the dedicated individuals who selflessly teach and help to maintain our flying skills every year. Thank you.",,"During climb out from ZZZ we received an EICAS message for C HYD QTY and C HYD SYS PRESS followed by an warnings. We noticed a rapid decrease in the Center HYD System pressure and quantity and performed the checklist associated with the system malfunction. Due to the aircraft being too heavy we dumped 10;000 lbs of fuel from the center tanks and then entered holding over ZZZZZ intersection to burn fuel so we could get below landing weight. We also [notified ATC] with ZZZ Center and communicated with company to formulate the best course of action. After getting to our landing weight we departed holding finished the emergency checklist and landed in ZZZ on runway XXR without incident. We were able to taxi the aircraft to the gate under its own power. After parking at the gate we de-briefed the cockpit crew; cabin crew and the maintenance personnel.

I felt no movement within the flight controls. I turned back on the auto pilot. The bumping was consistent with regular intervals of around 1 to 2 seconds. It was not turbulence that was causing the bumping to occur. My FO (First Officer) and I were uncomfortable with continuing the flight. I notified ATC and requested rescue vehicles upon landing. We leveled off at FL 250; I slowed the aircraft to 250k and the bumping stopped. I handed the aircraft over to my FO. I took at the QRH to see if there was a check list for our flight condition. I call Operations (we were still in radio range) and told them we had an emergency and to please contact my Dispatcher. I called and briefed the lead FA (Flight Attendant) and made a PA to the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZ. I took the aircraft back from my FO and proceeded back the ZZZ. My FO sent the logbook entrees to maintenance via ACARS. We continued to ZZZ at 250k with no further issues and made a safe over weight landing. Maintenance met us at the gate and was briefed.

My FO (First Officer) and I immediately donned our O2 masks and followed the procedure for 'Smoke.' I complied with the emergency procedure while the FO (PF; Pilot Flying) [notified ATC].

FA (Flight Attendant) in the aft galley stated that she had pulled circuit breakers in the aft galley in an attempt to eliminate the smoke/fumes. However; she reported that she could still smell the fumes. Captain and I put on O2 and we decided to divert to ZZZ as it was the closest usable airport. The Captain told me that he would run the Smoke/Fumes checklist on the QRC. He asked me [to contact] with Center and let them know we were diverting to ZZZ. I [explained the situation to Center and] told them we were diverting to ZZZ due to smoke/fumes reported in the aircraft. I then asked for a heading to the airport. Told ATC that we would like the emergency vehicles standing by to meet us on the runway. ATC gave us a turn to the airport and cleared us to descend to 3;000 feet. During the descent the Captain communicated to the passengers that we were diverting due to a report of smoke/electrical fumes in the aft galley and that this was the safest course of action. He also continued to communicate with the cabin crew to confirm if the fumes were getting worse or not. They reported that the situation was not worsening. We continued the descent into ZZZ and landed safely. The emergency operators met us on the runway and were able to confirm that there was no smoke/fumes in any of the cargo holds. Once they had completed their inspection of the aircraft exterior we taxied to the gate.The cabin crew in the aft galley reported smoke/fumes in the aft galley; but could not determine its origin or exact location. Based off of that information we diverted to ZZZ. Since the only information that we had was a report by the cabin crew of the smoke/fumes we felt it was safest to land ASAP to avoid a potentially worsening situation.I don't know what we could have done to avoid this situation. Obviously a report from a FA of smoke/fumes in the galley is serious. Since they could not determine where it was coming from and since we had no ECAM indications to possibly provide us with some more information of the only safe choice to make was to land quickly.

We called dispatch immediately and had a phone patch to [Maintenance Control] to discuss the issue. The oil pressure continued to drop during our roughly 3 minute discussion. Based on our current position; we all agreed the safest and most prudent course of action was to divert back to ZZZZ. The First Officer immediately called for the 2 Relief Officers; who were currently on break; to return to the cockpit. Everyone was briefed on the situation; as we had already turned back to ZZZZ. We informed the Purser of the issue and asked they begin picking up all trays and secure the cabin for landing in approximately 55 minutes. We also informed the passengers of our return to ZZZZ because of the situation. As we continued toward ZZZZ; the oil pressure continued to drop. We then [advised ATC] with ZZZZ1 ATC as it was becoming apparent we would eventually be shutting down the left engine; wanting priority handling to ZZZZ. We also began dumping fuel; which took 31 minutes to complete; to get us below an overweight landing situation. When the right engine pressure dropped to 14; we elected to disarm the left auto throttle and bring it to idle. We descended to FL240. Within 3 minutes of descending; the oil pressure was reading 9; the oil quantity was 0; [using] the ECL [Electronic Checklist] [for] the Engine Shutdown Checklist. We shut the left engine down as per the checklist. The Purser was notified of the current situation (TEST) and prepared the cabin as necessary. We asked ZZZZ Center to coordinate fire trucks at the airport for our return. We briefed an ILS to [Runway] 16R single engine auto land approach. We landed in ZZZZ without incident; taxied to a hardstand gate and deplaned passengers to buses. The ZZZZ Aviation Authority came on board the aircraft; asked us to write an incident report and took photos of our licenses and medicals before releasing us to leave the aircraft. I spoke directly with the [Maintenance Control] and Dispatch just prior to ZZZZ authorities boarding the aircraft; recapping the entire incident. [We] debriefed with our local mechanics of the engine issue and parameters we encountered prior to shutting down the left engine before leaving the aircraft and returning to the hotel.

The Captain (PM; Pilot Monitoring) called for a go-around which I executed and we informed Tower we had a gear problem. I continued the go-around; leaving the gear extended and accelerated and called for the flaps to be retracted to 1. I maintained 170 KIAS and climbed to 3;000 turning to a southeasterly heading (130?) as directed by Tower. I reengaged the autopilot and took over ATC radios as the PM Captain began running the ECAM. Running the ECAM basically entails recycling the gear which was unsuccessful. We then proceeded to the L/G Gravity Extension checklist. This checklist basically involves turning the gear hand crank 3 turns to the mechanical stop. This was also unsuccessful. I reached down and verified the hand crank was at the stop.At this time; we initiated a 'Dispatch Call me' and the Captain began discussing options with Dispatch and [Maintenance Control]. During this; I inquired about fuel (I think we had about 6;200 LBS) and we decided we would burn down to 4;000 prior to landing. I also coordinated a flyby of the tower so they could see the gear. During that flyby; tower said the gear appeared down and straight.I did not hear much of the conversation with Dispatch and [Maintenance Control]; but we then moved to the Landing with Abnormal Gear checklist. The Captain ran this while I maneuvered first in the Tower pattern and then out to an extended final. As the checklist was finishing I mentioned we were getting close to 4;000 LBS; so we decided to take a turn to the runway. Since I had been flying we elected to have me do the landing which basically involves landing and holding off the nose until just prior to loss of elevator authority. We also discussed the need to maintain below 1;000 PSI on the brake pressure during the stop. The checklist also mentions moving passengers aft; but since we were close to full that was not an option.I re-configured normal full flap and landed; holding off the nose and gently lowering it to the runway. The full stop was uneventful.After landing; fire and rescue met us as well as [Company Maintenance]. Upon inspection of the nose gear; Maintenance informed us that it was not over center and they could not put the pin in to be towed to the gate. Initially we were going to put jack the nose up; but that was deemed too dangerous with passengers on board and the relatively gusty wind conditions. We then elected to put a jack under the nose to prevent collapse and deplane the passengers via 2L and air stairs and bus them to the terminal.

They reported that the smell was stronger than they had experienced in the past but reported no smoke. I was going to go on break soon; so the Captain sent me to the cabin to assess the situation. Around row 18; I started noticing a strong electrical burning smell. One of the passengers reported seeing a flash above row 18 right before the smell started. I returned to the forward galley to talk to the Captain using the inter-phone. While telling him what I had observed; I thought it looked hazy in the back. I asked the Purser if he thought it looked hazy and he said 'It does look a little hazy.' I informed the Captain that we observed some haze and that I wanted to take one more look. I wasn't able to gather new information; so I went back up to the flight deck. We all discussed it and the decision was made to return to ZZZZ. While the Flying First Officer started the divert back to ZZZZ; the Captain directed me to finish the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist. He said he had completed the first 5 steps; so I reviewed the first 5 steps to ensure they had been done. We discussed the issue of oxygen masks but decided it would have been a larger threat to communication by donning them; with no evidence of smoke in the cockpit; than not donning them. After finishing the smoke fire or fumes checklist; the Captain directed me to accomplish the Overweight Landing Checklist as we had decided not to dump fuel. I accomplished that checklist and figured the performance limit weight and required landing distance using the performance tab in the QRH. A few times on the descent we received an R HYD SYS LOW PRESS and BRAKE SOURCE EICAS messages. We determined the right hydraulic system had pressure and appeared to be operating normally and reviewed the BRAKE SOURCE QRH even though it ultimately was not needed. Once the non-normal checklists were completed; we gave the flight attendants a briefing and made a PA to the passengers.

To get ahead; he conducted walk-around while passengers deplaned. All tires and other items appeared normal during exterior preflight. The aircraft mechanic later confirmed with me; during post flight; that he also checked the tires; with no issues noted. During preflight the F/O wrote down the hydraulic quantities of 92% A; and 87% B. We were near our max structural take-off weight. Load Planning confirmed with me that we could not take an off-line pilot jumpseater; and closely monitored the weight of the last bags; the jetway was even brought back to the aircraft to remove a standby passenger to lower our weight. We needed to burn (at least) 400 lbs of fuel to lower our weight during taxi. We began taxiing with 44.2k lbs; and requested a delay near the end of the runway to reach 43.8k lbs. Our weight at the beginning of the take-off roll was 174.1k lbs.During the take-off roll; Runway XR seemed rough to me; as if it needed repair; especially along the blackened center area during the first third of the runway. No asymmetry noted. I did note a very small; slightly abrupt jolt; upon lift-off. After lift-off we heard the next aircraft tell Tower that they were unable to take-off due to FOD (Foreign Object Damage) on 1R. We had noticed none. A couple minutes later; Departure told us that there were tire pieces on the runway; probably from us. They asked our intentions; whether we wanted to return to ZZZ. With autopilot on; I remained PF (Pilot Flying). The F/O and I discussed our lack of secondary indications; and the seemingly normal take-off. As we were overweight; I was not in a hurry to land unnecessarily. We had many landing options enroute ZZZ1; and could also ask ZZZ1 for assistance if needed; upon arrival. We told [Tracon] we would continue. Within a minute; the ENG1 LOW PRESSURE light; on the A side of the Hydraulic panel; illuminated. We assumed it was related to tire damage.The F/O ran the HYDRAULIC PUMP LOW PRESSURE QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) checklist; and we secured the ENG1 pump. Upon checking the hydraulic system; the copilot first saw 18%; and I saw 14% quantity. Pressure still indicated normal (2900+); but we doubted that would remain within limits for long. We told Approach we would be returning to ZZZ; and began reviewing Loss of Hydraulic System A QRH. A system pressure began dropping within a couple minutes. The F/O ran the LOSS OF SYSTEM A QRH. He also ensured an emergency was declared with ATC. I briefly notified the flight attendants; to not begin service; we would return to ZZZ within 30 minutes; we had a tire and hydraulic problem; and that I would most likely ask them to prep for Evac (Evacuation). Weather was perfect at ZZZ (VMC); winds 290/8; BKN70); and XR and XC were both 11;500 ft. We did not want XR; due to FOD; and planned/requested XC. F/O set up FMC (Flight Management Computer). F/O ensured that Approach knew we wanted emergency vehicles upon landing. I asked F/O to reiterate significant checklist items that would affect landing; and said we still needed approach brief; descent & approach checklists; and time for a PA announcement. He reminded me of the timing of the manual gear extension checklist as well. I also asked him to check FM (Flight Manual) for any guidance on overweight landings; and we found none. Instead; we calculated landing ground roll per emergency checklist (5-6;000ft); and discussed higher speeds (165kts for approach) in comparison to flap speeds. Dispatch additionally volunteered that XL landing would be 5000ft. I gave PA announcement to passengers; explaining problem briefly; plans to safely prep for all contingencies in back; and emphasized that they needed to listen to their very well trained flight attendants. F/O took control of plane while I briefed approach. We ran remaining checklists; reviewed evacuation checklist; and successfully extended gear manually.  F/O emphasized that gear would not retract during go-around. I discussed importance of F/O's 'remain seated' call during landing roll-out; as back of aircraft was thinking extensively about evacuation. We decided we would be spring-loaded to initially say this; and it could be changed later. I had F/O talk directly with F/A's to clarify how he would communicate with them (which he did exceptionally well.) Approach volunteered glideslope was out for XC ILS and offered visual. I requested LOC G/S out; to keep us matched more closely to planned approach. F/O also had box programmed for VNAV vertical guidance. Even though G/S indications were still received; and appeared correct; we referenced step-down altitudes on approach as well. About 3;000 feet; I disconnected autopilot and auto-throttle; and flew manually; to preclude excess automation programming on a VMC day; and focus upon approach speeds. PAPI 3-1 back-up; VNAV profile on FDI (flight Director Indicator); and step-down altitudes provided more than enough guidance. (Plus; we had emergency declared.) I touched down about 2;500-3;000 feet down runway. I sacrificed earlier touchdown; to prioritize rate of descent and a smooth touchdown; to minimize gear impact. Touchdown was very smooth; I used reverse during first 5;000 ft of roll-out; with no asymmetry noted; and brakes during last 3;000 of roll-out. As there was no asymmetry; minimal roughness; and aircraft did respond well to initial use of (alternate) nose-wheel steering; I elected to turn onto taxiway XX; and then stop immediately after hold-short. Approximately 5-10 emergency vehicles were waiting. I started APU immediately. F/O decided to leave flaps in down position. Fire Rescue gave us a contact frequency; and we spelled out we wanted tire inspection; check for smoke; excess heat; and leakage. They found significant tire damage; no smoke; temperatures of left and right brakes at 350F; and leakage. I had them clarify whether leakage was fuel or hydraulic; and it was hydraulic. They also found damage to underside of left wing; and we again asked for clarification on any fuel leakage from wing (there was none.)I was surprised that no tow vehicles were present. As we needed to stay on ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) and Ground frequencies; I ACARs'd Dispatch to request towing. It took 15 more minutes for tow tug to arrive. Beyond that; it took another 20 minutes; for ARFF to finish inspection; and clear out the 50+ people and 10+ vehicles. We made about 4 PA announcements; keeping passengers informed of fire inspection; request for tow equipment; arrival of tow equipment; and arrival gate. I additionally checked with F/A's (Flight Attendants) as to how they were doing; and how passengers were doing. They said all passengers were doing very well; which I believe is due to the excellent job our F/A's did; and the 20+ years experience they had. We were towed to gate X. The tow team requested that we initially request taxi. This led to confusion as to who was communication with Ground throughout the remainder of the towing operation; especially when we entered the ramp. It would be better to just have the tow operator communicate with Ground/Ramp; per their usual procedures; rather than add pilots into the mix. We can easily just monitor the same frequencies. Passengers deplaned uneventfully. Even though F/O did a phenomenal job with every step of this event; he and I decided that we did not want to fly any more until the following day. Chance of distraction was too great; and we needed a break.  I talked with Flight Manager and ALPA (Airline Pilots Association) Incident Hotline.",,"The Captain and I met early in the [pilots office]. After downloading all flight planning information; we discussed the dynamics of the flight to ZZZ1. Once at the airplane; I performed the walk around while the aircraft was deplaning. After all preflight flows and FMC (Flight Management Computer) loading; the Captain and I briefed the departure where the preliminary takeoff data for Runway XX was obtained. Once all briefings were complete; we completed the checklists (Preflight and Before Push) and were cleared to push from [gate] to expect Runway XR. On the push back; we started both engines. Upon completing the After Start checklist; we received an ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) message stating that our weights were invalid and we soon got new weights. I then got takeoff data for Runway XR. We taxied slow to Runway XR since we needed to burn 400 pounds from 44.2 to 43.8 to be at max takeoff weight. Seeing that we needed more time to burn taxi fuel; I requested to pull off in the run up pad of XR. After burning the 400 pounds; we told ground that we were ready for departure and ground told us to contact Tower. After 2 arrivals; we were cleared to line up and wait on XR and then cleared for takeoff. During the takeoff roll; nothing seemed out of normal. Upon rotation and the positive rate gear up call; I raised the gear and flaps as commanded and on schedule. Before being handed off to Departure; we heard an aircraft tell Tower that there was FOD (Foreign Object Damage) about 2000 feet down the runway. We checked in with Departure and were cleared to 7000 and direct to HAYGR on the MCRAY2 Departure. Subsequently; we were cleared to 11000 and then notified that the airplane to takeoff behind us reported FOD on the runway. [TRACON] then asked if we wanted to return to ZZZ. Since we had no indication at that moment we had a problem; the Captain and I discussed continuing. In due time; we got the LOW PRESS light above the ENG 1 hydraulic switch. I completed the QRH (Quick Reference handbook) for that light and brought up the SYS page on the lower DU (Display Unit) where I noticed that the hydraulic quantity on the A system was at 18 and dropping quickly (it started at 92). This eventually led to the LOSS OF SYSTEM A which the Captain and I were already discussing. We then [notified ATC] with [TRACON] and got delayed vectors to complete the QRH; prepare for the XC approach; TEST the flight attendants; and attempt to look up overweight landing procedure. We completed the XC approach to a safe landing where we exited at X1. ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) met us and we discussed at length if there was any possibility of fire. They thoroughly checked out the aircraft and we eventually got towed back to gate XX.",,"B737 Flight Crew encountered tire tread failure during takeoff.",

The flight was in normal cruise flight at 36;000 feet; approximately .81 Mach approaching the ZZZZZ waypoint; shortly after traveling north. During a scan of the engine instruments; I noticed that the right engine EPR (Engine Pressure Ratio) was reading 1.03 with a reduced fuel flow of about 3.0. The left engine EPR was much higher and the fuel flow was greater than 7.0. I pointed out the discrepancy to the Captain. We began to troubleshoot the problem and determined it was not an indication error. Movement of the right throttle caused no response in the right engine instrumentation nor was [an] engine response was felt or heard. The aircraft was maintaining 36;000 feet but had slowed down to approximately .78 mach. It appeared as if the right engine was stuck in idle. The right igniters were placed in the 'Flight' position; no positive response was indicated by this action. A fuel imbalance was noted so we began to balance the fuel. After a short discussion of available diverts; ZZZ was decided upon if required. Upon reaching waypoint ZZZZZ we checked in with ZZZ Control and informed them of the possible need to divert to ZZZ. I believe it was about 250 miles away at the time. Captain informed the cabin crew and summoned the First Officer that was on break. The Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via SATCOM. I concentrated on flying the aircraft and making radio calls. When the FO returned to the flight deck the Captain briefed her on the divert and the engine status and pulled out the QRH in case the status deteriorated. He also briefed the Purser; who also had to be gotten from break; with the TEST items and that we had 30 minutes until landing. Dispatch sent landing data and weather. The right engine continued to only produce an EPR of approximately 1.03. We informed ZZZ Control of our need to divert because of an engine issue and [requested priority handling]. We were given a vector and descent to 11;000 feet. During our descent to 11;000 feet; passing through 25-30;000 feet; the right engine failed which was indicated by oil pressure in the red. The Captain executed and FO read the beginning of the engine failure QRH. It was determined by an indication on N1 and N2 that the engine re-lite checklist would be accomplished. The EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) showed the relight altitudes and airspeeds and we were within those parameters. The QRH procedure was followed but the engine did not relight. The Captain informed ZZZ Approach that our engine loss of power was now an engine failure and that we were single engine. He also informed dispatch of the change in status and [Maintenance Control] and the Purser. ZZZ controllers gave us vectors to the ILS Runway X at ZZZ. We reviewed the emergency procedures to ensure we didn't miss anything. I briefed the approach IAW SOP. On localizer interception; the aircraft was high and fast so I disconnected the autopilot and hand flew the now visual approach. The approach to land was high all the way until approximately 300 feet. (My 500 foot callout was non-standard: I called out 'Correcting' the high flight path). At about 40 feet the Captain stated 'Flare'; and I did so: I landed the aircraft (normal touchdown and within the landing zone) and came to a complete stop on the runway centerline. The 4 right brakes showed signs of overheating (EICAS display of up to 9) so we exited the runway and executed the QRH Hot Brake procedures. While waiting for the brakes to cool; the emergency ground crew noticed fuel leaking from the right engine. We noticed the right Fuel Control switch was on with one of the lights above it illuminated; we placed it in Cutoff. The fuel leak continued so we pulled the right engine fire handle (but did not fire the bottle) and the fuel leak stopped. Additionally; the two; right; inboard tires deflated as their fuse plugs blew. After waiting the required brake cooling time; the aircraft was towed to the gate in ZZZ. A walk around inspection revealed the two deflated tires but no visible damage to the right engine. Earlier in the flight we did I receive two engine related status messages; one was the R ENG EEC (Electronic Engine Control) C1 and I don't recall the other. During the flight I looked it up in the MEL and it reads 'NOTE: C1 FAULTS ARE ANNUNCIATED FOR MAINTENANCE PURPOSES ONLY' so I disregarded it. I have no idea if this caused the engine malfunction or not.",,"I was the original pilot flying so I was taking the second break. Our break was two hours and forty five minutes. I set an alarm to have a few extra minutes to awaken before going back to the flight deck. On this flight I was awoken early by the Flight Attendant. I was then advised by another Flight Attendant that the crew mentioned possibly diverting. At this point I returned to the flight deck. When I arrived on the flight deck the crew was in communication with ZZZ Approach and beginning to divert. The crew [requested priority handling] with ATC. Due to workload at the time; I suggested that I become the relief pilot and the other First Officer continue flying. The Captain began briefing me on the communications he had made with dispatch and maintenance and the engine indications prompting a divert. He provided me with the paper copy of the QRH 'just in case' we should need it. I began to look up the engine section of the QRH. The Captain then contacted the flight attendants to brief them and they had to wake up the Purser from her break. I proceeded to add ZZZ to our flight and obtain the charts in Jeppesen Pro. At this point the landing data and weather came from Dispatch. The flight was cleared to descend from 30;000 feet to 11;000 feet. During the descent; between 30;000-25;000 feet the engine failed indicated by 0 oil pressure. The Captain called for the engine failure QRH. I read the beginning of the checklist and the crew decided that we could attempt a re-light. I switched to the engine inflight start QRH. The EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Altering System) showed the altitudes and speed windows required for a relight. I read and the captain did the QRH. The engine did not relight. The Captain advised Dispatch and Maintenance that the engine did not relight and we were single engine. The Captain then advised ATC that our status had gone from a reduced thrust engine to a failed engine. He also called the flight attendants and spoke with the purser and gave her the TEST items with 25 minutes to landing. He briefed the passengers. The crew then briefed the approach for ILS X to ZZZ. We reviewed the QRH to make sure we got all the steps. I did find the QRH complicated because you had to skip over/verify [aircraft variant] procedures which are embedded in the same checklist. The flight continued to be vectored for ILS X and cleared to descend to 6000 feet. The crew began configuring the aircraft with flaps. The Controller asked if we were alright with 10 mile final; which they said they were. We were then cleared to 3000 feet and to intercept. The Captain queried the flying pilot that we were high at which point he made corrections to the throttles and from my vantage point I could see the green arc come back to where it needed to be. The crew continued to configure the aircraft so that we were fully configured with gear down and flaps 20. This assisted in correcting being high; but the aircraft was on speed and descending. We continued the approach and landed visually. The flying pilot did respond to the 500 foot call with correcting as he was making adjustments to the altitude. The touchdown was smooth; under control and on centerline. Rollout felt and looked normal. The crew stopped the aircraft on the runway. Emergency equipment was waiting for us. At this point we noticed that the right brake indicators were 7-9. The crew communicated to tower that we needed exit the runway and remain on a taxiway. I read the Hot Brakes/BRAKE TEMP QRH and I turned to the BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) chart and read it to the crew. The crew followed the chart and notes in the warning area. The flight attendants were advised it would be at least 60 minutes before we could move. The aircraft was chocked and left engine shutdown. During the ground inspection the ground crew advised us that the engine was leaking fuel. At this point we noticed that the fuel cutoff switch was still in run. An identified error/omission fromthe Inflight restart checklist. It was moved to cutoff. The ground crew was asked if the engine was still leaking. They said yes. At this point the crew decided that we needed to pull the engine fire handle. After doing this the ground crew advised the leak stopped. The ground crew also advised us that the two inboard right tires had blown their plugs. The Captain contacted Maintenance to confirm if we could be towed with passengers on board. They said yes; so we arranged with ground personnel to tow us to a gate. During this time we received helpful messages from Dispatch as to the plans for Customs and our passengers and crew. However; I made numerous attempts to contact ZZZ Operations personnel so that we could verify. I was unable to reach them by radio. I also tried to call them on the phone number listed. No answer. It wasn't until we were at the gate that an agent came to the flight deck to advise us the plan for the passengers and flight.",,"B767 flight crew reported an engine failure; resulting in a diversion.",

The next 20 or so times this occurred; the pitch trim wheel spun back; in a trim up direction varying from .2 to .8 units followed by the autopilot disconnecting. We tried both autopilot 1 and 2. After a few attempts with the autopilot engaged; this continued to occur. We then kept it disconnected and manually flew the rest of the flight to a landing in ZZZ. The event only stopped occurring once we got the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) message ELAC (Elevator Aileron Computer) 1 PITCH FAULT; and ELAC 2 PITCH FAULT. This put the aircraft into Alternate Law. We made the decision to divert to ZZZ once this kept happening while the autopilot was disconnected. We followed through with all ECAM actions and landed in ZZZ.

My First Officer needed to use the rest room. He called the crew and within minutes; the Flight Attendant entered the cockpit and the First Officer stepped out.I was placing my mask on when I realized that something just didn't sound right. Specifically; when I first pulled the mask out of the stored position. There was no hissing sound or any flow of oxygen. I pulled up the oxygen page and realized that all cockpit crew oxygen was completely depleted. At that point; I did not want to alarm or panic the Flight Attendant that was currently in the cockpit.I waited for my First Officer to return and requested from ZZZZ Control to descend to FL250. I also requested that the Relief Pilot return to the flight deck. I got a hold of Dispatch to inform them of our situations and diversion options. At this point; I had already informed ZZZZ Control Sector that we were working on an issue with the aircraft. I told Dispatch that due to our current aircraft status; we couldn't continue and needed to divert. I mentioned I was looking at ZZZZ1 and ZZZZ2. The Dispatcher informed me that those two airports could only be used for emergency purposes only. I confirmed with dispatch that I would [be advising ATC]; at that point; we both agreed on ZZZZ1.I was very comfortable with ZZZZ1 because both myself and the First Officer had been there in the past and runways and facilities were adequate for our aircraft and passengers. Shortly after [advising ATC] we were asked to squawk 7700 by air traffic control. We were vector to a 15 to 20 mile final for Runway XXC. We relayed to ATC the souls on board of 248 and a total fuel on board of approximately 110;000 [pounds] of fuel. The landing waiting at touchdown was 397;000 pounds. The landing was were smooth and rollout was uneventful. Emergency personnel followed the aircraft to the remote stand. The emergency personnel inspected the landing gear we were given the all clear. I believe that from a CRM prospective; we all (flight crew; Dispatch; Maintenance; ATC; and emergency personnel) worked well together inside and outside the cockpit to get the aircraft safely on the ground.",,"During the preflight; I performed a full oxygen mask test by removing the mask; cleaning it; and then testing its operation by wearing it. Following the above; I finished the test by running oxygen through the mask for 10 seconds while observing the crew oxygen pressure in the Status page. Everything tested satisfactorily. Approaching intersection ZZZZZ at FL300 we started the process for a bathroom break. When the cabin was ready by the flight attendants; I transferred the controls to the Captain; and after letting a Flight Attendant in the flight deck; I went to the bathroom. When I returned; I noticed that the Captain wasn't wearing his mask. I sat on my seat and was informed by the Captain that the Crew Oxygen was down to 12 psi. The Captain transferred the controls back to me; requested a descent to FL250; and asked the Flight Attendant to coordinate the return of the Relief Pilot. While descending; I also took over the ATC communications while the Captain started communicating with Dispatch; [Maintenance Control]; and the Purser. After a short level off at FL250; we requested FL100 and [advised ATC]. We also agreed that ZZZZ1 was the best choice for a divert due to its proximity; runway length; weather; and emergency equipment/personnel availability. We were given vectors for an ILS XXC which was flown uneventfully. One of the challenges while configuring for landing was the min flap vrs max flap speeds that due to the weight of the airplane were very close to each other. The arrival was in smooth air so there were no flap over-speeds. We performed an overweight landing at 397480 lbs of which the ATC was informed. The touchdown was smooth with no side load and the deceleration slow so the brakes never heated up above normal. The emergency vehicles followed us to the remote stand and kept us informed of the wheel temps for approximately half hour after full stop; when they determined that there was no more threats related to hot brakes.We completed our crew debrief and discussed that we should have descended to FL100 quicker. Also; one of the flight attendants suggested to the Purser to send some portable oxygen bottles to us in the cockpit but he decided not to act on it not wanting to interrupt us during a busy time. We agreed that that would have been a good idea.",,"B767 pilot crew reported at cruise they discovered the crew oxygen system was empty.",

About the same time; TCAS issued a 'traffic traffic' call. We sighted the VFR aircraft; which appeared to be close off our left; and maintained visual separation as instructed by ATC.  Our recommended procedure of selecting TA on simultaneous parallel approaches (ZZZ 10-7) sets us up for not having TCAS RAs available following a go-around. We aren't trained; nor did I ever think about; going back to TA/RA after our Tower instructed go-around. It wasn't until we heard 'traffic traffic' that I remembered we were still in TA.

We reviewed the N1/N2 vibration indicators and they were well within the normal range. I suggested to the Captain that the vibration may be happening from something other than the engines. The Captain suggested that we review the vibration advisory in the QRH. We reviewed the QRH regarding engine vibration and noted what to do; in the event we had excessive engine vibration. The procedure was not needed under these specific conditions.The vibration was intermittent and hard to concretely sense it was really any concern. However; we did; for our own interest; review nearest airport options in case the vibration became significant.The vibration ended; and we didn't discuss more about it. Then about 10-15 minutes later; I smelled a burning smell towards the rudder pedals. It had the smell of something similar to when you light a match. I also felt some heat from the fumes. I advised the Captain that I believed we had smoke in the flight deck and we immediately donned our air masks. We then called the FAs (Flight Attendants); and they reported that they did not smell any smoke. We advised the FAs that we were keeping our masks on for now because we smelled smoke.  The Captain and I were slightly surprised that the FAs did not smell anything; because we were still smelling smoke. So to troubleshoot; we decided to look at all of our PEDs (personal devices) to see if anything was burning. PEDs were fine. While keeping the masks on; we did each take them off briefly to confirm we still had a burning smell; which we did.There were no indications from any of our instrumentation and advisory system screens that anything out of the ordinary was going on. But; I had no confidence that the burning smell was going to end. Rather; I was concerned that that situation was going to escalate from a burning smell to a fire. I shared my concerns with the Captain and that I felt we needed to divert to ZZZ (we were about 10-15 minutes from Top of Descent to [original destination]) if the smell persisted for 2 more minutes; and he agreed. The smell persisted; we advised Center that we needed to divert to ZZZ. They gave us vectors direct and to descend to 16;000 ft. We then advised the flight attendants we were diverting to ZZZ because we kept smelling a burning smell in the flight deck.Shortly after we started our descent; the FA's advised us that they also had a noticeable burning smell from the Exit Row up to the Flight Deck. Upon receiving this information; the Captain and I concurred that we should [advise ATC]; for priority into ZZZ and to have Fire/Rescue at the field. (Later we would also learn that there was a First Officer in Row 17; who also noticed a burning smell while were descending and asked the Flight Attendants if we were descending because of the burning smell.) I advised the FAs to grab their [emergency gear] at the ready; in case the situation got worse.We [advised ATC of the situation]; which triggered a plethora of ATC scripted questions to us; which workload permitting I answered. (e.g. the nature of the smoke?; where the smoke was?; were we wearing our oxygen masks?; souls on board?; fuel remaining?). Our priority at this point was to get the aircraft on the ground safely; but as quickly as possible. On the descent; I was very busy as Pilot Monitoring. First; we had our air masks on the whole time; which was cumbersome. Second; handling numerous comms with ATC; talking to the FAs; discussing the divert with the Captain; and loading a divert into the FMS for ZZZ. The Captain was handling the emergency descent; which took most of his attention. Center offered us any runway at ZZZ; I asked which way they were landing; they said west; so I requested XXL. The Captain was so busy with the descent that he did not change his instrument approach plates from [theoriginal destination] to ZZZ; nor did he have time to; so I asked for him to hand me his iPad and I loaded the appropriate plates for the divert to ZZZ.Approach checklist was handled through 18;000 feet; as is standard. Flight Attendants advised they were doing okay in the cabin. We discussed how to brief the passengers; FAs asked if we were going to say something to the passengers. But; because we were wearing our air masks; I asked the FAs to give the briefing; as I did not want to raise more panic by them hearing me sound like Darth Vader on the overhead speaker with my air mask on. The Captain advised them to say we were going to ZZZ out of a safety precaution. While getting ready for landing; I did not have time to get ATIS; were too busy; so I asked ATC for the weather; to enter into the FMS for performance. The weather was good; it would be a night visual. We did not have time to ACARS dispatch of the divert; that would have been too much of a time sink and a distraction. I thought about it; but did not see having any time to do it; nor did I think about asking ATC to contact company; was just too busy.When we got lined up for a long final approach; we were still too high; so ATC vectored us out towards the East. They asked me when we wanted to turn back to the field. I advised them that it was too dark in the direction we were flying; that we could not see the airport; we were descending at 3;000 fpm; and if they would help us by calling our turn back to the final approach course. I was also getting task saturated.ATC turned us a couple more times; then switched us to Approach Control. At this point they advised us that Rwy XXL was closed (I wish Center would have told us; since we requested XXL with them; that would have saved me time close in to the field). So; I was busy again loading the FMS for XXR. When handed off to tower; we advised that we anticipated a normal landing; and that we planned to taxi off the runway. Landing Checklist was completed. Fire and Rescue was all lined up; adjacent to the field. Landing was uneventful.Upon landing; we taxied off. At this point there began to be confusion. First; we called Ops and they said they didn't have a gate for us; Second; Ground Control advised that the Fire Department was on a different frequency and wanted to talk about how to scan the plane for hot spots; third; we had a bunch of caution/fault lights just come on after we taxied off the runway regarding Faults with the Avionics Blower and Extract Fan; requiring an ECAM procedure to override; and then the Fault warnings repeated even after we pressed the overrides. While talking with the Fire Department; they advised we needed to pull to a gate to scan the plane. At that moment; the FA's in the back called us and advised that they now; for the first time; were smelling smoke. We told them to update us if it got worse and that we were sorting out getting a gate.We quickly advised Ops that we needed a gate immediately; or we were going to request any gate at the airport. And if we didn't get any gate and if the smoke smell escalated; then the next consideration was to potentially have the air slides deploy to get the passengers off the plane. Ops responded to go to Gate Z. Upon getting to the gate; the ground crew scrambled to get us in; after parking we opened up our emergency windows in the flight deck; to get fresh air in the plane.Fire Department came on the plane first in full gear (while the passengers remained seated); followed by Maintenance in the flight deck where they reviewed the fault lights we had for the avionics. The Captain got real busy with Dispatch; maintenance; and observing the deplaning process.While we were super busy in the flight deck; a [company] Gate Lead popped in and interrupted us in front of maintenance to tell us that Crew Scheduling had us taking another Airbus; that was a RON (Routine Overnight); to take the passengers on to [the original destination]. The Captain politely told the Gate Lead that we did not know that and we weren't sure we were going to do that; and that we had to talk to several people before we consider that.The Captain called the [Chief Pilot]; and apparently the [Chief Pilot] said that we could take the passengers on to [the original destination]; but he had our back either way if we decided not to. At this point; that would have been an FDP (Flight Duty Period) extension. I told the Captain that I was shocked that the [Chief Pilot] would even suggest such a thing; us flying another leg and take an extension; after we had just had an emergency; performed an emergency descent; a divert to ZZZ; and had our air masks on for over 30 minutes. I found it to be incredibly insensitive; and inappropriate. The inconvenience to the passengers should be handled by another flight crew; it appeared to me that Management's view of Safety was getting blurred with operational needs to accommodate the stranded passengers.After the flight had deplaned the Captain; walked up the jetway to greet passengers to see if everyone was okay. There were no health problems. Meanwhile; the flight attendants and I discussed that we did not want to do another leg. One flight attendant in particular had already told the Gate Lead that he did not want to work another leg.While in the jetway; discussing the situation with the flight crew; the Gate Lead came down to talk to us; but she was still on the phone; talking to someone in Dispatch/Ops and telling them that she wasn't sure if the crew was going to continue to [the original destination]; because one of the flight attendants was having issues. The flight attendant told the Gate Lead that it was very insensitive of her to be calling him out in front of everybody as the problem for not continuing the flight to [the original destination]. The Gate Lead did not get what the FA was saying; rather she started to bark at all of us; that all her Managers had gone for the day; they had no real help from the company to accommodate the stranded passengers and that it was going to be a real inconvenience for them; if we didn't continue on with another flight.The Gate Lead left for a moment; and the crew discussed how we felt about flying another leg. All three FA's said they were tired and could do the flight; only because it was short. The Captain said he was fine to continue to [the original destination]; but if other's didn't want to go; he would support that decision. One Flight Attendant said because it was a short flight he could do it; but really didn't want to because earlier this year he had a fume event and got sick from it; and had to get medical attention. The Captain said; whatever you guys want to do; I'll support your decision. The Gate Lead came back again; she looked stressed and then got really pushy and was saying 'I don't know what's the hold-up; are you going to do the flight?' At this point I said that the Gate Lead was too overbearing; that she was smothering us and becoming the problem; pushing us after we had just handled an emergency; and we still needed time to decompress. The Gate Lead would not leave; and I told her that we were not going to make a decision until she gave us some space.After the Gate Lead left; I reflected on the day (three legs; and not wanting to do an FDP extension for a 4th leg; after an emergency). While I knew I could go to [the original destination]; I was now irritated by the Gate Lead singling out the FA that didn't want to go; and then being way too pushy to us to work the next flight. So; I told the Captain; there's no way I'm doing another leg; and we need hotel rooms in ZZZ. The Captain told the Gate Lead.While waiting for Crew Scheduling to figure out hotels; the Gate Lead approached me and said she was sorry; that she realized we have a very busy night; and she was wrong to push us.[Company] pushes crews after an emergency to work extra flight.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported mild airframe vibrations followed by a burning odor and fumes; which resulted in a diversion.",

Departing from gate.  This was my fifth right seat leg in the LCA training. My first leg out of ZZZ and on this ID. All preparations flows and checklists went well and the performance data was loaded for a reduced takeoff from XYR at [taxiway]. The final WT manifest showed:TOG: 159234TOW CHG: -615 ZFW: 130634 CG: 23.6 TAKEOFF DATA MSG SHOWED: 3KT HEADWIND 8KT CROSSWIND TOCG/TRIM 23.6 REDUCED NUMBERS WERE V1 147 VR 149 V2 153 On taxiout we were given taxi instructions for a XXL Departure. RWY XXL via [taxi route]. [En route during taxi] I reported going heads down to load the new runway and get new performance numbers. Ground traffic was light with minimal delays and minor ATC distractions encountered except for slowing to wait for a maintenance truck to move off and clear to the right as we turned onto Victor taxiway. The new runway was loaded; Performance requested and loaded; checklists completed; lineup and wait and takeoff clearance given. Takeoff roll and call outs were normal. As I recall; after the rotate call; the rotation felt normal. With the wheels still on the runway; and as rotation continued I felt an abnormal thump. We became airborne; began to climb and raised the gear. Initially; the Captain thought we must have blown a tire on the right side and reported that possibility to the tower. We noted that the gear came up normally and that all the gear lights were out (normal indications). Tower informed us they would inspect the runway and report the results through ATC.I thought initially that it might be due to dissipating wingtip vortices from a B777 that had landed recently on XYC [intersecting runway]. While waiting for a response from ATC the Captain called the flight attendants and ask if they felt the same anomaly. They confirmed that they felt the thump. We both suspected that ATC would confirm a tire failure. Somewhere close to the top of climb (FL340) ATC passed the word that ZZZ had completed a runway sweep and that no tire debris was located. We began to troubleshoot other options. Bird strike and cargo shift were briefly discussed and dismissed. I briefly considered tail strike but since my tendency is to rotate between 2-2.5 degrees per second; and my departure pitch is normally between 5-5.9 degrees (I can never recall more than 6.3 degrees); I thought it unlikely. However; since we were still stymied by the lack of tire failure confirmation I checked the [Flight Data Unit]. To my surprise Departure pitch was 11.2 degrees. On a B737-800 tail strike can occur at 11 degrees. I reported the discovery to the Captain and he immediately informed Dispatch as I pulled out the QRH. The Captain suggested a return to ZZZ (nearest suitable). Dispatch wanted a Conference Call with [Maintenance Control] and the [Chief Pilot]. Ultimately the decision was made to divert to ZZZ1 (nearest suitable after the conference call).The landing in ZZZ1 was uneventful and upon gate arrival maintenance confirmed a tail strike with the tail shoe scraped. Red and green lines remained visible on the cartridge. While airborne and after we determined that a tail strike was the suspected event I retrieved all of the departure paperwork and reviewed it for errors or anomalies. What I found was: TAKEOFF DATA FOR RWY XXL that was loaded AND EXECUTED was: 8KT HW 3KT XW CG 23.6 FLAPS 5 BLEEDS ON ASSUMED WT 130.8ASSUMED TEMP 65CREDUCED EPR 89.8V1 127 VR 133 V2 138I had loaded and requested ZFW as my TOG wt. What's worse is that after executing those TO speeds we received an ACARS msg that said: ************WARNING'************ REQUESTED TAKEOFF DATA MESSAGE ASSUMED WT 130.8 LESS THAN FINAL WEIGHT MANIFEST TOG 159.3 I recall getting that message about the time the maintenance truck was becoming an issue. WhenI returned to look at the message my eyes went straight to 130.8 and I failed to read the entire message. I confirmed 130.8 on the TOW page and accepted and executed the speeds for takeoff.This was clearly a costly error on my part and I make no excuses for my lack of attention to detail in this matter. Lack of experience in the right seat and ACARS performance work is no excuse. I also should have shown the Captain the message which would have slowed me down and; I am confident; would have prevented the tail strike.",,"I am a Line Check Airman; during this event I was performing right seat training for a new LCA (Line Check Airman.) We had planned departing off of runway XYR and programmed the FMC. During taxi we were advised of the runway change and [the FO (First Officer)] went heads down to begin working on the task. We had to respond to a couple of instructions from the ground controller that required his attention. When [the FO] was inputting our weight into the ACARS Take Off data page (see attached) he did not enter the correct aircraft weight and our V-speeds were significantly less than what they should have been for our actual weight.When the tailstrike occurred I initially thought we had blown a tire. We both heard and felt a soft thump. I asked the tower to inspect the runway for evidence of the blown tire and they responded that he would and the TRACON would advise us of what they found. Several minutes past and the Center controller advised us that they did not find any evidence of a blown tire. We considered other threats to and ruled them out. Bird strikes; cargo shift. After ruling those threats out [the FO] check the ACARS [Flight Data Unit] pitch report and it was 11.1 degrees. I called the flight attendants and asked them if they had felt or heard anything and they responded that; yes they heard and felt the noise but weren't sure what it was. [The FO] and I looked at the tail strike QRH checklist. The checklist said to not pressurize the airplane and land at the nearest suitable airport. We were already at cruise at FL340. I contacted our Dispatcher (see attached) and he arranged a conference call with the [Chief Pilot]; [Maintenance Control]; and the Fleet Technical advisor. After discussing the issue at length we agreed it continue to [our destination]. At this point we were abeam ZZZ1 and I made the decision to divert there to have the aircraft inspected (see attached) instead of continuing to [our destination].

Fairly heavy B737NG at 174;000 lbs; 35;000 lbs of fuel bound for ZZZ1. At approximately 2;000 MSL I began to detect a burning or melting plastic odor; smelling identical to what a piece of Tupperware that had fallen onto the heating element in a dishwasher and melted would smell like. I asked the First Officer if he smelled it and he replied 'YES'. We were still sterile cockpit; but the flight attendants called from the back and were very concerned with the same odor that was 'filling the cabin.' I told them to search the cabin to see if the source of the odor could be isolated; lavatories; ovens; coffee maker etc.; and call back. We had leveled at 5;000 feet and when ZZZ Departure issued us another climb; I declined the climb and told ATC we had an issue and would get back with them. At this point the First Officer's audio control panel went haywire with extremely loud static being broadcast into his headset and speaker; regardless of what radio was selected and he was unable to transmit. The Purser called back and said that the source of the odor could not be determined but it was strong; and she now smelled what she described as 'burning paper.' This aircraft had just returned to service after a change of the #2 engine and this was the first flight after the change. The engine in terms of performance was operating normally but the possibility of it being involved in creating this situation did give me further concern. With the combination of the unidentifiable odor and failure of communication equipment; I made the decision to [advise ATC] and return back to ZZZ.Once [advised]; ATC was very efficient in getting us back around for a landing on one of the long western facing runways and things happened rapidly. We were landing overweight and I wanted a long runway for braking and winds which were quite gusty with a crosswind component. The First Officer remained as the Flying Pilot and executed a normal approach and landing to Runway XXR. Upon exiting the runway; we had fire and emergency personnel inspect the aircraft for a potential fire source. No abnormal heat source could be detected; and we returned to [the] gate without further incident.",,"I was the Pilot Flying taking off from Runway XXR out of ZZZ when passing thru 2;500 feet we started smelling a plastic like burning smell.

At this time; the Captain was talking to the Flight Attendant and I was flying and working the radios. At 5;000 feet we were given a climb and I told ATC to standby. Shortly after that; my radio comms 1 and 2 went completely to static. At that point; the Captain [advised ATC] and wanted vectors for an immediate return. We worked through the checklists and set up for an ILS to [Runway] XXR due to the strong crosswinds and overweight landing we wanted a long runway. ATC helped out with getting us back and notifying the emergency equipment to be ready when we touched down. On landing and rollout everything was normal. The emergency personnel inspected the outside of the aircraft for any signs of fire and smoke and gave us the OK to continue back to gate.

After lengthy delay for weather and ramp closure; taxi to and departed RWY XXR ZZZ on ZZZZZ2 RNAV SID. After hearing windshear alerts/warnings being issued by ATC; we pulled out of line to check performance numbers and decided to use improved performance with TOGA and APU on for an abundance of caution given the weather and takeoff weight of the aircraft. Departed XXR without incident on heading 340 for weather avoidance with subsequent radar vectors to rejoin the departure. APU was shut down normally as part of after takeoff flow. Approx. climbing through FL210 to FL300; two ECAM caution messages illuminated (AIR ENG1 BLD ABNORM PR and AIR ENG2 BLD ABNORML PR). FO retained control of the aircraft and assumed radio communications; I (CA) began completing the ECAM action items; which did not correct the malfunction. The QRH was referenced for follow up action which allowed for two reset attempts since the takeoff was completed APU on. However; the QRH was not clear in the event of both EBV failing. We attempted the EBV resets with no resolution of the malfunction. Noting that there was no air being directed to the packs; the cabin altitude was beginning to rise; and started the APU to mitigate the pressurization issue as an added barrier for safety. The cabin altitude then stabilized normally. I (CA) then contacted IOC via the sat phone app for other maintenance guidance and discussing a likely return to ZZZ. During that call an additional ECAM caution message air APU bleed fault and noted then APU bleed valve also closed to the packs and cabin altitude began to rise rapidly. At that point; a request was made with ATC to return to ZZZ along with an immediate descent with a pressurization issue. We began a left turn to heading 180 and began emergency descent to FL100 while monitoring cabin altitude which peaked at 8;900 feet. I briefed cabin crew; passengers and dispatch with emergency and plan return to ZZZ. The flight crew discussed and determined an immediate overweight landing was the safest course of action given the multi-system failures; current aircraft weight of approximately 175;000 lbs; and unstable weather in the area. Completed QRH overweight landing procedures and reviewed landing performance data for ZZZ RWY XYR. A request was made for ARFF [airport rescue firefighting] to be available during landing and taxi in the event of a hot brake complication. Normal flaps full; low auto brakes landing was made with vertical descent rate of less than 100 FPM. Full reverse immediately applied at touchdown and auto brakes off about halfway down the RWY with stopping distance assured. ARFF reported nothing abnormal with gear and followed aircraft to gate. With brake fans on; single-engine taxi procedures used to reduce further brake load. Peak brake temp of 290 c.

While we were following the ECAM for the gear not up locked; Captain called for Flaps 1 and we got another ECAM for flaps locked and continued following the ECAM. While dealing with both of these ECAM messages we [advised ATC] as we realized we had multiple hydraulic issues as more ECAM messages popped in. The first was the green hydraulic system overheat. While addressing that we got the yellow system overheat and began to realize we had a serious hydraulic issue. We followed ECAM protocol and had a red 'Land ASAP' message along with several others. As we received vectors for ZZZ1 which was our request for our [situation]; we quickly assessed that we could have full flight control failure and asked to turn to Runway XXL immediately to land as quickly as safely possible. We had to gravity drop the gear; we had flaps jammed at Position 1 and we finished all ECAMs. ECAMs complete; screens normal. Ran landing checklist; let cabin attendants know we were diverting to Newark and to remain seated with seat belts fastened.The landing was normal and smooth. As the plane touched down I noticed the left side was a little lower than the right but the Captain was able to keep it on the centerline as he decelerated. Braking felt normal. As it slowed down we began to drift to the right and the Captain was able to keep it mostly on the high speed taxiway with just a small portion of the aircraft off the side. We completed the evacuation checklist per SOP and evacuated the aircraft. Both Captain and I followed checklist and SOP for verifying the aircraft was clear; and evacuated ourselves.",,"Normal takeoff from ZZZ. Soon after takeoff; got a landing gear not up locked ECAM. While addressing that issue; we got a flaps locked ECAM and pressed on with both issues via ECAM. After addressing ECAM issues; [advised ATC]. Then while working with ATC; got several more ECAMs. First one was green hydraulic system overheat; followed quickly thereafter by yellow system overheat; worked both ECAMs and started to assess situation in general. A red Land ASAP was displayed on ECAM. [First Officer] and I completed ECAMS. Stated ECAM complete; screens normal and came to the conclusion that we had two hydraulic system overheats leaving one hydraulic system available. Implications being if we lost the remaining hydraulic system; we may lose control of the aircraft. Made an immediate turn towards XXL in ZZZ1 honoring Land ASAP message and crew resource management. While keeping in mind; gravity gear extension and flaps locked ECAM checklist. Landing was normal except a slight left dip upon touchdown with light winds. Fairly normal deceleration; all things considered; then a gradual yaw to the right despite full left rudder. Prearranged for fire trucks to be standing by. Departed runway surface by about ten feet despite maximum effort to maintain centerline. Completed evacuation checklist per SOP. Conclusions upon raising the gear; multiple ECAM occurred; the most concerning being left with one hydraulic system as two overheated. Therefore; landed in ZZZ1 as soon as possible.",,"A319 flight crew reported multiple hydraulic failures shortly after departure resulting in an uneventful immediate diversion.",

We were in ZZZ on an originator. Runway XXR was the active runway.  During takeoff at approximately 90 knots the First Officer and I both started to smell a faint odor in the cockpit.  We briefly discussed it as it continued to intensify and I made the decision to continue takeoff.  As we passed through 500 feet AGL; the odor turned into heavy burning oil-like fumes.  I could noticeably feel tingling in my fingers and a slight light-headedness.  We both went on oxygen.  At approximately 800 feet AGL; the flight attendants called and reported significant fumes throughout the cabin.  I notified ATC; [advised]; and requested vectors for a return to Runway XX. We stopped the climb and while the First Officer flew the aircraft; I ran the Smoke; Fire; or Fumes Checklist using the QRC.  After completing that; the QRC directed us to the QRH; Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist.  The QRH checklist seemed designed for electrical fire/fumes; as it called for shutting down multiple electrical components. The First Officer and I agreed that what we currently had was not an electrical problem and decided to stop that checklist and prepare for the return.  We gathered landing data via [weight and balance system] and completed the Descent and Approach Checklists as well as quickly referencing the Diversion Checklist.  The First Officer flew the aircraft and prepared the FMC and cockpit for a landing on Runway XX at ZZZ. When I talked to the flight attendants a second time they reported the fumes were still very strong and I could hear them coughing while trying to talk.  We focused on getting the aircraft on the ground as quickly and as safely as possible.  I briefed the passengers on the PA and told them we would be returning to ZZZ.  When we were established on final approach; I took the aircraft from the First Officer and we made a normal landing (we were under max gross weight for landing).  We stopped on the runway to allow the Fire/Crash Crews to inspect the exterior of the aircraft.  They did not see anything out of the ordinary and we asked them to follow us to the gate.We pulled into the gate and had the passengers exit normally using the jet bridge.  The First Officer and I were on oxygen from 500 feet AGL after takeoff until engine shutdown at the gate.  After all passengers had deplaned; I debriefed with the crew.  All five of us reported symptoms that included headaches; numbness in fingers; soreness in throat/chest; shortness of breath; dry cough and light-headedness.  We went to a local emergency room and were released five hours later after continuous oxygen treatment and carbon monoxide blood tests.After the flight; Maintenance told us they had performed an engine wash the night before the incident and that it is possible that it had something to do with the fumes.  If that is the case; then perhaps the engine wash and subsequent engine run procedures need to be reviewed in an effort to prevent this type of event from happening again.",,,,"Flight crew flying 737-700 encountered fumes in the cockpit after takeoff.",

We finally figured out that the problem was his ACP (Audio Control Panel) panel. It was causing problems with his speaker and Mic. He could only hear out of my side. I told him to make the landing and I will do the radios. It was just after that time we got a F/CTL ELAC 2 PITCH FAULT ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). We got the book out and went through the reset procedure. When we reset the ELAC (Elevator Aileron Control) we received a FLT CONTROL ELAC 2 FAULT and F/ CTL L ELEV FAULT. I should also mention that on takeoff on [Runway] 28L in ZZZ when I rotated the aircraft it felt unresponsive with pitch initially. I even mentioned to [First Officer] that the CG must have been wrong; so this now got my attention. Descent was now upon us and we started down. When reading the notes in the book about no use of the speed brakes and Flaps 3 landing with a note that said we would lose normal law and revert to direct law when we dropped the gear. I decided to try to communicate with Dispatch and Maintenance. I had them call me and with the radio issues and was able to confirm what we had read in the handbook. The work load was really starting to increase at this point. I told [First Officer] I would take control of the aircraft. With the degradation of the elevator system along with being unable to use the speed brakes to meet ATC constraints on the STAR; I decided to [advise ATC]. I briefed our Purser about the situation but did not prep the cabin. ATC got us right in and we landed on Runway 9 with no issues.

First flight was to ZZZZ in Aircraft X. During my walk-around I took a picture of the tail skid; which had a small amount of green visible on the warning decal. I showed this to the CA (Captain) when I returned to the cockpit for SA (Situational Awareness). All phases of ground ops were normal. Captain was PF (Pilot Flying). We got to know each other more during cruise and found out we lived very close to each other. He thoroughly briefed the planned arrival and landing into ZZZZ. We reviewed all Jepps thoroughly and complied with all checklists. He flew the ILS Runway 07 to a very good landing. We had normal ground ops at ZZZZ. [The next day] when we arrived at the aircraft our FAs (Flight Attendants) from the prior day were on board. During my walk-around I found the tail skid had the same small amount of green visible on the warning decal as the day prior; so I did not take a picture as it was exactly the same as the day prior. I updated the CA with this info when I returned to the cockpit. My preflight ops were normal. I got departure clearance and final weights came in. I rejected the FMC (Flight Management Computer) takeoff data because the GW (Gross Weight) was 160.7 and the TOW (Take-off Weight) was 160.2. I requested ACARS takeoff performance for 160.7. I was expecting to do this because the CA had added on an extra 1000 fuel for weather. During pushback and engine start ACARS alerts were received by both of us and the FMC was updated. I checked the take-off data for correct altitudes. I set flaps 1 and called ground for taxi. During taxi; the before takeoff checklist was accomplished. I was verbalizing ACARS printouts on my yoke and verifying on the FMC pages. I set V2 of 130 in the speed window. I said that was a low V2. I adjusted the trim. We gave way to an aircraft crossing on 'G' as we taxied down 'A' and monitored Tower. When we got to the end of the taxiway; the CA asked if we were all caught up and I said we were. We transferred aircraft control lined up on centerline for Runway X. I held the brakes with my feet. Once cleared; takeoff roll began and I rotated at VR of 124. The aircraft felt light and different during my slow pull back on the yoke; so I slowly pulled a little more. It felt like a long time for the aircraft to lift off. I felt and heard a thump. I saw the taxiway for Runway XX to the right. Once airborne; the gear was retracted; I said that we met 3460 ft; then the CA said to watch my speed. I lowered the nose and the stick shaker activated. I lowered the nose again and we began to accelerate and continued turn and climb for ZZZZZ above 5000 ft in VNAV/LNAV. An FA called and confirmed the tail strike. We cleaned up the aircraft; accomplished the After Takeoff checklist and checked in with Departure. We wanted to get above the MSA (Minimum Sector Altitude) of 12900 ft before accomplishing another checklist. The autopilot was on and the CA started the Tailstrike checklist. We were above 18000 ft when the CA was able to coordinate a descent and fix for a holding pattern to burn fuel. We did not declare an emergency because we were unable return to ZZZZ due to our weight. Once below 10000 ft we manually depressurized the aircraft and entered a holding pattern at ZZZZZ1 at 9000 ft and 230 kts. ATC moved the holding pattern to ZZZZZ2 at 9000. In the holding pattern when the Tailstrike checklist was complete; the CA talked to the FAs; Dispatch and the passengers. The aircraft was stable - we aviated; navigated and communicated; so I started reviewing the ACARS print outs and ACARS messages. I found my error of 106.7 vice the correct weight of 160.7. I found the ACARS take off data warning message of assumed weight 106.7 less than final weight manifest of TOG 160.3. My heart sank! As weather moved in ATC reassigned the holding pattern to ZZZZZ1 at 9000 ft with 10-mile legs. We accomplished the Descent checklist and the CA briefed his approach andlanding for flaps 40 and autobrakes 3; ILS Runway X. ACARS comms were intermittent; so we manually checked landing distance for weight 146.0; applied corrections and verified runway length was greater than 7200 ft needed. The CA flew the ILS Runway X to a very good flaps 40 landing. We had normal ground ops to the gate at ZZZZ. The flight was just over 3 hours. The station wanted to know the CA's plan on what to do with the passengers. They gave the CA a message to call the Chief Pilot. I wanted to do a walk around to see the tail but moved quickly because there were so many people. There was a small amount of red visible on the warning decal on the tail skid. When I returned to the cockpit the Ops General Manager asked the CA to fill out a form and took pictures of our licenses for the [local aviation authority]. Later two [local] officials; who identified themselves as [aviation authority]; wanted information. They did not present any identifications. We asked FA to interpret. After all the passengers deplaned; they needed to move to the aircraft. We coordinated to complete our paperwork in the Operations office. We were delayed exiting Customs because the general declaration from the previous date was not acceptable and required extra coordination. After the CA completed the form for the General Manager; he helped to interpret the additional paperwork for the [local] officials who had followed us to Operations. After coordination with Scheduling we took a taxi to the hotel.",,,,"B737 First Officer reported entering an incorrect gross weight into the FMC for obtaining takeoff performance data.

There was an alternate and I added 1000 lbs of fuel. The aircraft was preflighted and we briefed. The brief included taxi; terrain; engine failure/t procedures and takeoff profile. The station and ground crew were ready to close/push early. I felt as though they wanted us to push early. We did not push until 5-10 min prior push time. The takeoff data was initially rejected the GW was greater than the TOW. The First Officer entered a takeoff weight of 106.7 vice the correct weight of 160.7. Also the takeoff data was for a flaps 1 takeoff. Both engines were simultaneously started after push. The taxi is relatively short and there were only 1 or 2 aircraft waiting for takeoff. During the taxi; the before takeoff checklist was completed; the incorrect weight was not caught by the crew. We held on the taxiway for a prop aircraft to clear. We took the runway and the aircraft was given to [the First Officer]. There is an upslope [this runway]; however; I did not feel the acceleration was unusually slow. During takeoff roll the aircraft was on centerline but the runway/roll was bumpy. I called out V1; Rotate. The pilot flying initially rotated to 6 degrees at a normal rate and momentarily stopped rotation. Then the rotation continued. The pitch was recorded at 11.4 degrees and the tail strike occurred. With a positive rate the gear was raised. On the climb out I believe the pitch was high greater than 15 degrees and the airspeed was low (and decreasing). At some point during this time the stick shaker activated. I called out airspeed; [First Officer] lowered the pitch and airspeed increased. We continued climb out flying the departure; all altitude and speed constraints were met. During climb out the flight attendants contacted the flight deck and confirmed a tail strike. We continued to fly the aircraft; [after] clearing high terrain I opened the tail strike checklist in the QRH. The aircraft leveled at 19000 ft. [and] was pressurized. We coordinated with ATC for a descent first to 12000; then 10000 ft. and eventually 9000 ft. At 9000 ft. via the checklist we set the outflow valve to manual. We held as shown on the approach charts. We held to burn fuel to the max limit landing weight. We talked and decided not to landed overweight and risk structural damage. We held for over 2 hours. ATC; the company/dispatch; flight attendants and passengers were notified of our situation and intended return to [departure airport]. The aircraft landed (flaps 40 brakes 3) without further incident. The passengers were boarded off the aircraft and handled by station personnel.",,,,"B737-800 Captain reported a tail strike occurred on takeoff when the First Officer entered an incorrect takeoff weight that was not caught by either pilot.",

Several passengers noticed to odor as well. The flight attendants began their efforts to determine the source and we began the 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes' Checklist. A Company Pilot was in the back and after several minutes; the flight attendants and the pilot determined the odor was increasing. We [advised ATC] and were given direct to ZZZ. I then advised the passengers of the situation and that we were a [priority] aircraft. The flight attendants prepared the cabin for landing and the First Officer and I determined a diversion to ZZZ2 was not warranted. We landed on [Runway] XXL without incident. As we cleared the runway; CFR inspected the aircraft and found the left main landing gear brakes were glowing. We proceeded slowly to the gate with CFR in tow. We called Ops to inform ground personnel to avoid the aircraft until it could be determined safe to approach the aircraft.In retrospect; I should have briefed the flight attendants in the cabin for normal landing. On final we heard the commands from the cabin; which was not warranted at that time which surprised us because I had the First Officer check on the situation just prior to base leg one more time and the odor was stable. Earlier; I had informed the flight attendants an evacuation was not warranted. Although; if I had just asked them to secure the cabin and the situation escalated; we would regret not preparing the cabin. Also; a BRACE! BRACE! BRACE! command was not warranted or given over the PA; so I am not sure the 'Heads Down Stay Down' commands were correct procedure.  There was a breakdown in communication and of overall knowledge of cabin procedures on my part to have the proper game plan in place before arrival.",,"At cruise FL 390; approximately 100 miles prior to planned STAR descent; a Flight Attendant informed Captain that a 'burning rubber' smell was prevalent near row 16. Neither the Captain nor I could smell it. It was asked if there was any smoke or haze visible and we were informed there was not. The Captain decided that an [ATC should be advised]. There was a brief discussion about nearby airports of which there were plenty; but we decided to continue to ZZZ with the priority handling (Direct ZZZ; speed/ALT our discretion). The smoke/fire/fumes QRH was actioned intermittently as workload/communication permitted. We proceed direct to ZZZ at high speed (300 knots). After [advising ATC]; I did not monitor communication between Captain and cabin; as to better monitor the aircraft state and communicate with ATC. QRH was not completed because of the short time to landing and the condition in the cabin not escalating. Speed was high on downwind and a short turn to final with a flaps 40 landing. 'Heads down stay down' could be heard upon slowing and turning short final. After clearing the runway; we stopped and ARFF was asked to inspect the aircraft briefly with much communication problems and the only thing to report was a 'glowing' brake. Taxi to gate; deplane; go home. The smell in the cabin seemed to create a false sense of urgency and greater distraction than necessary. At no time was there any smoke or haze visible; nor did the smell worsen. In addition; the company pilot traveling in the back was asked if he could smell it; and he stated that he could not smell it over the fragrance/lotion that someone had put on near him. At no time could it be smelt on the flight deck or the extremities of the cabin. Communication: There was a breakdown in communication between the cockpit and cabin as to 'emergency' Relevant to ATC; yes; [ATC was advised] as a precaution; but at no time was the safety of the aircraft ever in question. The 'emergency' word was used in communicating with the cabin which resulted in a misconception of how the remainder of the flight was going to be conducted with regard to safety procedures when in reality we just needed priority handling to land with no undue delay. The false sense of peril and urgency resulted in a confused state in the cabin and an undesirable state of the aircraft which put us in a far greater state of risk than the event which precipitated the 'emergency' in the first place. The Captain continued to perform Pilot Flying duties as well as frequent communication with the cabin during a high workload phase of flight. This was further compounded by a high energy approach and resultant unstable approach.",,"B737-700 flight crew reported strong burning rubber smell throughout the aircraft resulting in an uneventful landing at destination.",

The Captain was already there; we said hello; [and] I did my walk around then started my preflight duties. As we were boarding; we were having the standard (where are you from) conversation. Captain told me he lives out of base and is relatively new to ZZZ. He then said he was actually thinking about changing bases soon because he can't take the attitudes of ZZZ First Officer's. Personally; I have been a ZZZ First Officer for 5 years and have never heard of a problem. Being concerned; I asked what's been going on. He never really gave me an example; but he basically said that these First Officers have a problem with challenging the Captain. Then he said that he is sure that we won't have that issue on this trip because I don't seem like that type of guy. Then he continued and told me that if I do want to play the game of who knows more; that he promises that it won't end well for me. I assured him that I don't play those games and I only speak up if it's a safety issue or I feel it necessary. And that was about the extent of my briefing from the Captain. I thought it was odd that at this day and age; my briefing was basically 'don't challenge the Captain'. I then told him that he can't hurt my feelings and to please speak up if he sees me making a mistake.At this time; Maintenance comes into the flight deck to tell us a tire that was questionable was well within their limits and that we were good to go. Maintenance questioned what guidance we had and we explained our guidance is much different than theirs; usually more conservative. I gave the mechanic the example of the hydraulic fluid quantities and their 'normal fill' range. The book states if it is at all outside of those limits; even for thermal expansion; that we are required to call Maintenance. The Captain then spoke up and said that wasn't true as they've added a note saying that as long as we don't have any ECAMs that we don't have to call Maintenance. I was surprised he said that and asked when it changed. He said it changed a long time ago; probably 6 months ago. I said that I must have missed the change and we moved on. During the taxi; we had a crosswind that was technically a 1 knot tailwind. I said ok no problem; TOGA take off and I'll go to the TPS and work the number. Captain told me not to use the TPS but to just request a new TPS using 'request T.O. Data' and put the tailwind in there. I said that doesn't work. You can compute the tailwind penalty manually or call and have a new TPS sent with the tailwind penalty added. He said 'oh really; well you're the only First Officer that seems to think that'. He then continued and told me that about 30 of his last First Officer's requested a new TPS with the tailwind. I said that I found that odd because they make it every clear in training that you cannot do this. I asked if I could just do this manually for now and we could talk about the tailwind and the TPS during our flight to ZZZ1. He agreed. As I was heads down doing the penalty; the Captain was swerving down the taxiway because he was also heads down doing the same thing. I said I'll take care of this so you can taxi. He said no it's ok; I'm good at taxiing. So a short time later; I said ok we have a TOGA take off and our penalty is 970 LBS. off MTOW. He said; not its 1;050 [LBS]. I said ok maybe I looked at it wrong. I looked again and it was in fact 970 lbs. He looked again and agreed as he saw his mistake. We were legal to take off. Once we were on our way and not busy with ZZZ; I looked up the note about the normal fill for the hydraulics. I read the note and it still says we are required to call Maintenance. I showed the Captain. He read it and was surprised that it said what it said and that he must have missed the last sentence. We moved on and I said let's look at the TPS. I said that; like the hydraulic issue; I'm looking this up for my own personal knowledge. Things change all the time and who knows; maybe [Company] pushed the button that allows us to grab a new TPS with a tailwind. So I said I'll request a new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind and see what it says. He said; we are in flight; you can't request a new TPS because we are in flight. I said sure you can and pushed the button and spit it out. I showed him the new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind compared to our original TPS and both were identical. The Captain was in the TPS flow chart in the QRH and was in disbelief that it didn't say that you could request a new TPS with a tailwind. He then said 'damn it if I'm going to lose a beer over this'. At this point; I stopped him and said the he wasn't going to lose a beer because we aren't playing a game of who knows what. There have been a ton of changes and if something as important as when to call Maintenance or how to know if we're legal for takeoff; I want to know. That was it. At this point I realized that tension was building. The Captain was irritated that I was challenging him. I decided at this point that I wasn't going to speak up unless I absolutely had to. Now one thing I didn't mention was that the Captain briefed the flight attendants to stay seated for 1 hr and 30 minutes after takeoff as a precaution because of what was left of the hurricane. We were routed around to the north of it but he still kept them down. I thought that was excessive. The ride was smooth. I didn't say anything. Nor did I say a thing when we had to deviate around cells. He would do an all call and tell everyone to take their seats. We were deviating a long way around these cells and I had absolutely no doubt that it would be a smooth ride. We even had reports from other aircraft that the ride was smooth. The other thing I felt was odd; was that less than one minute after he called the flight attendants; he was surprised that they were still dealing with their carts and not already in their seats. I honestly don't think he has any idea what the flight attendants have to do to clean up and sit down. The flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 was mostly smooth. We have specific guidance in regards to the ride quality when it comes to flight attendants and passengers.Either way we had an uneventful flight to ZZZ1 and we had good conversation. The next morning we were getting ready for our leg back to ZZZ. We were ready for departure but I believe we had to wait for traffic behind us. The Captain put the delay for pay purposes into ACARS. I was just making small talk and said I heard there was a potentially easier way of doing it that might save him time. This set him off. The Captain kept saying; almost yelling 'it's amazing when you upgrade everyone tries to prove you wrong. Just you wait; it's amazing. Everyone just tries to prove you wrong.' This little rant went on for an uncomfortable amount of time. I finally stopped him and said that is absolutely not what I'm trying to do and that I'm sorry that I somehow came off that way. I said that there have been so many big changes that it's very difficult to keep up and so easy to miss. I told him how just last month I was told that I was doing a checklist incorrectly. We looked it up and sure enough they were correct. I told him there were no hard feelings and I was glad it was brought to my attention. That was the end of that conversation.  I want to be clear the reason I wrote such detail about the events leading up to the diversion is because I think it's important and can better understand how we ended up in ZZZ2. It's my leg to ZZZ from ZZZ1. We are in a full 320. We have been airborne for less than 20 minutes. The Captain is eating his kung pow kitty as the Flight Attendant calls. She said she turned the oven on and about 1 minute later smoke started coming out. Captain asked if she turned it off and she said she did. He instructed her not to open the oven and that we are diverting. He hangs up with her; looks at me and said smoke in the cabin; we're going down now! Before I could say a word he grabs the mic and [advises ATC] and said we needed to get on the ground immediately. He then dons his O2 mask even though there wasn't even a hint of smoke or even a smell in the flight deck. Because his was on; I grabbed mine. After about 2 minutes; the Captain realized he couldn't communicate very well and he takes it off; as do I. Now I can't remember if we knew on initial contact that the oven was no longer smoking or if it was just a few minutes later. Either way; the Captain and I knew that there were dinner rolls in the oven; it started smoking 1 minute after she turned it on and that it stopped smoking as soon as she turned the oven off.I could not believe we were diverting....for toast. The Captain was busy running the smoke in the cabin checklist and I was flying the plane and talking to ATC. I strongly considered talking to the Captain and asking if we should possibly reconsider the diversion since it doesn't seem to be a safety of flight issue. Considering the way he has responded to any type of questioning; and the fact that he was currently deep in the yellow and headed for the red; if I questioned his judgement; it would have put him through the roof and that would have been very unsafe in any phase of flight; especially a diversion. I decided the safest course was to just go along with his diversion and not question him. During the diversion; he must have fired off a text to Dispatch saying we needed to divert. I don't know what his message said. Initially I suggested we turn back towards ZZZ1. So we did. I then realized we were far too heavy for the short runway. I pulled up ZZZ3 and it was too far for the Captain. At this time Dispatch responds and said to divert to ZZZ2. I plug it in and it was 40 miles to the East. I said Dispatch said to go to ZZZ2. He said that's where he wants to go also. I told ATC and we started to head that way. I slowed the plane down to give us time; changed destination and set up for the ILS. I did the landing distance for our weight and it said around 8;000 feet; we had 13;200 feet. I briefed the Captain and told him I was doing flaps full with manual auto brakes. Since we had such a long runway I was going to stay off the brakes until under 100 kts to keep them from getting too hot. I told him I already spoke with ATC and said we'd either make a right turn off or back taxi. He cut me off and said we were going to be stopping on the runway and having the trucks look us over with their equipment and look for any hot spots and to also check our brake temps. I had a nice touchdown and used the brakes as I briefed. We came to a stop and watched the trucks surround us. As we sit there we put the brake fans on; the temps never got over 220. Minutes go by and I said I'll use this time to call Tower and ask exactly where we are parking. I got snapped at by the Captain once again. He said I needed to calm down and to stop interfering with their emergency procedures. A short time later; Tower called us asking if we were ready to taxi yet. Captain responded that after the fire trucks have looked us over and checked our brake temps that we'd then be able to taxi. Tower said he were completely fine. Again; our brake temps were never above 220. Captain tells Tower we are ready to taxi and we do. There were ramp personnel waiting for us and they parked us on the ramp just before where they park the RJ's so we don't block them. Air stairs are brought to our plane and the fire fighters confirm there is no fire and they leave. At this point we haven't deplaned. Captain looked to me and said he said he was done flying and that it would be unsafe for us to continue due to the nature of the high stress emergency. I said that I think we should consider just getting fuel and continuing. Of course we needed an overweight inspection. He said we were done. So now we needed to get the passengers to the terminal.

Turning base to final the autopilot started crisscrossing centerline trying to establish. I took over manually and was having a hard time concentrating on flying the airplane. I felt like I was woken from a REM sleep. I had been awake for over 2 hours. I had a difficult time doing two things at once. I wasn't scanning; just staring. My FO (First Officer) and [Relief Pilot] were offering guidance but sounded like distant voices. Around 700 ft. AGL I managed to force myself to concentrate and made a pretty sweet landing and turnoff. Upon setting brakes after a short 4 minute taxi I ran back to the bathroom and threw up a significant volume. The nausea hit me immediately. I threw up several times in a bag in the crew van and also a few more times at the hotel. I don't know what happened. I think I was developing physical symptoms of illness in the terminal area. Not the nausea which hit after parking the brakes. Maybe my blood pressure dropped or something but I was mentally out of it mostly on the approach. I didn't take any medicines or supplements but I did eat 4 hours before I got sick. It was clear and a million on the approach and though I only have been in the 777 [for several months] I have flown into ZZZ a couple dozen times. I felt OK; about 80%; the following morning and just slept all day. By pickup that evening I was fine. Though my chest was very sore from dry heaving. On the approach I think I exceeded flaps 30 max speed of 170 KIAS as well. The IAS was plus or minus 15-20 knots as it was very gusty from 4000 ft. to touchdown. I also had a glide slope warning at about 1500 ft. AGL I was told but I don't remember it. I think I experienced an initial insidious physiological sensory degradation from food poisoning. As I descended onto downwind. That's all it could be. I was so sick for the rest of the evening and the vomiting started maybe 8 minutes after the awful approach I conducted. I just do not fly an airplane that bad.",,,,"B777 Captain reported feeling partially incapacitated during the final phase of flight; possibly due to food poisoning.",

He went on to say; that Flight Attendant was well familiar with the odor as he had experienced four previous events. We quickly established sat phone contact with Dispatch and Maintenance. I advised them that I would keep them informed; especially should the situation worsen. Shortly thereafter; the lead Flight Attendant called and said the smell was expanding to cover approximately four rows around row 22; now AC left and right. He further stated that more flight attendants were feeling ill with dizziness; coughing and headache symptoms. At this point; I made the decision; with the help of the lead; First Officer and [Relief Pilot] (he had quickly been summoned back to the flight deck from break) to return to ZZZ. I asked the Flight Attendant to keep me informed. The decision to return to ZZZ was based; in part; that the smell was localized and pax and crew had been moved out of the affected area. Shortly after informing ATC and reversing course; the Lead informed me that the majority of crew were now suffering symptoms and that one was vomiting and on O2. At that point; I made the decision to [advise ATC about a medical event] and land ASAP which was ZZZ1. At that point we were approximately 60NM north of ZZZ1 at 37;000 feet. Through CRM; duties were assigned; and we began our descent. Because we were so close to ZZZ1; the complete QRH procedure was not completed.

Checking the engine instruments I saw that Engine 2 EPR had fallen to zero thrust (1.0); and that the EPR discrepancy indications were in view. Shortly thereafter the ECAM announced (I believe) 'ENG 2 FF DISCREPANCY'. I announced the failure; checked the Quick Reference Card; then confirmed that the FO (First Officer) would continue to fly the aircraft while I performed the ECAM actions. I complied with the ECAM action; and began to search for follow up action when the FO announced that airspeed was decreasing. I broadcast a 'Pan Pan' and advised ATC that we needed an immediate descent. ATC cleared us lower and I continued to look for follow up actions; which I failed to find in the QRH - although I did find them on subsequent review. ATC advised ZZZ was nearby; and with the support and information provided by the FO I elected to divert to ZZZ; and informed ATC of that fact. Meanwhile ECAM messages for generator failure; then engine failure were displayed; and acted upon; I notified the flight attendants and the passengers; and sent a diversion message to Company Dispatch.While I was thus engaged; the FO copied the ATIS; reprogrammed the FMS for the new arrival and provided supplemental information about runway length; etc.We completed ECAM actions; reviewed the non-routine landing considerations; updated the cabin crew; performed the Descent and Before landing checklists as appropriate; and the FO executed a smooth; overweight landing. After clearing the runway we communicated with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) and confirmed that there were no unusual indications exterior to the aircraft; then proceeded to parking on the hard stand and deplaned the passengers.Event occurred due to a loss of thrust from Engine 2.Throughout the early stages of this event I was presented with multiple demands on my attention from different sources in quick succession - primarily cascading ECAM warnings. I found myself frustrated by my inability to quickly locate information in the QRH. The multiple indexes and non-alphabetical organization of the 'alphabetical' index; combined with the location of the indices several pages deep in the QRH; made it difficult to quickly confirm whether further action was required; or available; and resulted in considerable back-tracking and re-assessing. Additionally; the listing of the system (i.e.: ENG 1(2)) before each individual ECAM item makes it difficult to pick out the relevant issue; since the identification of the specific issue only begins in the middle of the listing. Under the pressure of time and stress it is far too easy to miss the particular line applicable to the immediate problem.Another issue of note is that the engine failure follow up procedure in the QRH fails to refer to the 'Drift down and One Engine Cruise' procedure located elsewhere in the handbook. Further; the initial ECAM warnings (Fuel Flow and Generator issues) failed to address the primary issue; which was the loss of thrust from the #2 engine. The actions called for during the first couple of ECAM warnings were largely irrelevant to the larger issue of the engine failure; and attempting to work through those procedures served no purpose other than to delay and distract from the more important matters at hand. When the 'ENGINE 2 FAIL' message finally displayed - and it was notably delayed - we were well into the descent; and had already decided to divert to ZZZ. The fact that the initial ECAM warnings very obviously failed to address a far more serious issue only served to exacerbate the existing stress and confusion as I sought to locate guidance for an issue that the ECAM had not identified (though I had). Given a design philosophy that prioritizes the ECAM for emergency and non-normal procedures; coupled with a QRH that is not particularly user friendly; the failure of the ECAM to annunciate the engine failure until well into the diversion was a significant hindrance to timely; correct response to this significant failure.",,,,"A320 Captain reported a loss of thrust on the #2 engine which resulted in a diversion and landing.",

By the time I was back up front; the Captain and First Officer had already made communications with ATC and Dispatch to return to ZZZ. During this time; communication with the cabin crew continued. The Captain asked me to go back and check on the odor and crew. I was told the odor was concentrated on aircraft right; by the mid lavatory. As I walked towards the rear of the aircraft; it was as though I walked into a bubble of gas. Approximately 10 feet more and I was out of it. The smell was very strong and concentrated; fitting the descriptions in our QRH; [though] I would not categorize as transient (during cruise; descent and continuing until past sundown at landing). I would also categorize it as a STRONG Category A (sweet; sour; musty; dirty sock smell; irritating to the eyes). All of the cabin crew complained of similar symptoms (headache; nauseous; dizziness). Upon returning to the flight deck; I briefed the Captain and First Officer. I used periodic oxygen for the remainder of the flight as I too had some mild symptoms. The #1 Flight Attendant relocated several of the passengers. With symptoms continuing and the odor not diminishing; we decided that it was safer to land at ZZZ1. A medical emergency [was advised with ATC] and an overweight landing was executed to [Runway] XXL. Some observations were upon arrival at the gate; several emergency vehicles were inside the aircraft area. The most disturbing thing was that there was no urgency to get the passengers and crew off the aircraft.",,"We had just gotten airborne and were starting our service when the #2 Flight Attendant called and said there was a dirty sock smell in the aft and passengers were complaining about it.  The Second Officer was on his break and in the crew rest seat in the Business Class cabin and went to the back and smelled the same smell.  We advised the Captain and he requested we divert to ZZZ1 or return to ZZZ.  I didn't smell at first until after 5 minutes of them smelling it.  I became dizzy and nauseated and had to sit down as I was having difficulty breathing.  When we arrived in ZZZ1; the Fire Chief DEMANDED all flight attendants get off and get evaluated on the jetway and leave the passengers on the aircraft unattended.

She believed the passenger needed emergency medical attention. I returned to the frequency and advised the First Officer of the situation and that I was going to ask ATC to arrange for EMS to meet the flight. ATC acknowledged our request and gave us a vector for RUNTS and cleared us direct to the fix. As the First Officer was programming the FMC for the new clearance; I said; 'We're going to be high; I'll slow you down;' as I selected the Speed bug to the MASI UP bug. The First Officer acknowledged what I had done and I verified RUNTS on the LEGS page. The First Officer executed the change and selected LNAV. As he was doing so; ATC cleared us to 3;000 feet. The First Officer immediately called for flaps 1 because we could see that we had some excess energy; but the situation remained manageable. Just below 4;000 feet ATC asked if we had the field in sight. I asked the First Officer if he had the airport and he said he did. I called the field in sight to ATC and he cleared us for a visual approach. I felt we still had extra energy but did not say anything because I felt the situation was easily recoverable with speed brakes or landing gear. The First Officer then selected direct HOBEL on the FMC; asked for verification and executed the change. We were then immediately high on the VNAV profile. The First Officer called for flaps 5. Speed was about 200 knots and I thought we needed flaps 10/speedbrakes/landing gear. Again; I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be thought of as a micromanaging Captain. A few miles before HOBEL I finally said; 'Gear?' and the First Officer called for the landing gear. By then we definitely had excess energy. The autopilot overshot the final in the turn over HOBEL and the First Officer disengaged it and flew manually. I focused my attention inside the cockpit on glideslope proximity and airspeed. We were configured at 1;000'= feet but a little fast. I didn't call for a go-around because I was concerned about the ill passenger and we were correcting nicely. At 500 feet we were stable and I looked up to see that we were aligned with Runway 31R (the wrong runway). I called for a go-around. The go-around was poorly flown and I (finally) became much more directive; giving the First Officer headings and altitudes. We were cleared for closed left traffic. The First Officer configured early and got the aircraft slowed to 170 KIAS; but he was aware that he was descending quickly through 1;200 feet AGL much too early. I then took control of the aircraft; leveled off at 1;200 feet AGL and got the aircraft completely configured and on Speed. We completed the Before Landing Checklist and I stabilized the aircraft on the glideslope and localizer. Just above 1;000 feet AGL; I gave the aircraft back to the First Officer. The subsequent final approach and landing was within Company limits. I should have been much clearer much sooner that we were carrying extra energy. Later; I should have been far more directive in getting the aircraft slowed and configured. When the situation first happened; before I said anything to ATC about the ill passenger; I should have said; 'Let's not rush this; take your time and do this right.'",,,,"B-737 Captain reported having to execute a go-around after expediting the approach due to an ill passenger.",

I was Pilot Monitoring and the First Officer was Pilot Flying. It was a beautiful morning with clear skies and no turbulence. Suddenly we had an ECAM message 'OVER SPEED' accompanied by flashing master warning lights and a continuous repetitive chime. We accomplished the FIX strategy; with the First Officer maintaining aircraft control. We initially crosschecked our airspeed indications; but all 3 were in agreement with no abnormalities. I verified that the flap handle was up and the aircraft indicated a clean configuration. The only ECAM procedure indicated was 'VFE....235'; which was obviously impossible at our altitude. We discussed the situation and decided to execute the Unreliable Speed Indication/ADR Check procedure in the QRH. The Pilot Flying disconnected autopilot; A/T and flight directors and we double-checked pitch and power; which were appropriate for our flight regime. We did not turn off any ADRs because all flight instruments appeared normal and I did not want to 'compound' the emergency by taking the aircraft out of normal law at that time. At no time were we within 15-20 knots of Vmax.We were able to silence the repetitive chime by pushing the EMER CANC button but the ECAM message and flashing master warning light remained. I instructed the Pilot Flying to declare an emergency and turn toward ZZZ2; the closest suitable airport. In coordination with ATC; he began a descent and slowed to 280 KIAS; then 250 KAIS at 10;000 feet. I notified Dispatch; the flight attendants and the passengers; then discussed an overweight landing with the First Officer. After slowing down; the OVER SPEED warning would intermittently extinguish for a few seconds and then return (again with flashing master warning lights and continuous repetitive chime). After evaluating all relevant circumstances I determined that it was safer to land overweight than to continue flight until at or below maximum certificated landing weight. Because the OVER SPEED warning was not associated with an actual over speed condition I was concerned about possible alternative causes (e.g. an ADR problem or other unknown malfunction) that could affect aircraft controllability. The First Officer flew a textbook ILS approach to Runway XXC and executed a flawless overweight landing (185;000 lbs.); touching down at less than 200 fpm rate of descent and delaying brake application (with the brake fans on the brake temperatures never rose above 150 [degrees] Celsius after landing). We taxied to the gate; shut down the aircraft and deplaned the passengers. Aircraft mechanics arrived and conducted over speed and overweight landing inspections; finding no damage. [Maintenance Control] decided that since no actual over speed had occurred; all that was required was to reset the warning system by lowering and retracting the flaps (which the mechanics did) and the aircraft would be returned to service. I discussed the matter with the [Maintenance Control] representative and expressed my concern that this would not identify or address the actual cause of the problem. [Maintenance Control] stated that the only way to troubleshoot the aircraft would be to download and analyze the FDR data; but that the required personnel and equipment were not available at ZZZ2. They offered to reset the ADRs and Flight Warning Computers instead. At this point I told [Maintenance Control] that I would not fly the aircraft again unless further investigation was done; and made an entry in the aircraft logbook to that effect. The First Officer and I subsequently requested to be removed from flight duty for the remained of the day.",,,,"Captain reported ECAM Message OVER SPEED with all three airspeed indication reading no over speed; diverted for a precautionary landing at an airport without the technicians or equipment available to return aircraft to service; so flight crew refused the aircraft.",

It was a flaps-15 takeoff; so we continued the cleanup process while I hand flew the aircraft while donning my oxygen mask. We continued to fly the SID to the 4;000 hold-down; while notifying ATC of our [situation] and request for vectors for an immediate return.The remainder of the flight was uneventful. We launched off Runway 15R and recovered via a 'figure-8' left turn to downwind for the RNAV Runway 10. I touched down very gently; with the power up; because I knew that this would affect the overweight landing inspection procedure. I was easy on the brakes. The aircraft decelerated well in maximum reverse. Fire trucks followed us onto the runway and surrounded the aircraft. They looked the aircraft over and used an IR camera to examine the aircraft. After declaring no unusual observations; they then followed us to the gate.Once we donned oxygen masks; we were committed to making an expeditious recovery. Although we did not know the source or origin of the detected odors; we 'assumed the worst' and I was personally convinced that it was necessary to return as soon as possible. (I was later informed by Maintenance Control that they found a failed static inverter.)My First Officer; who is very experienced and ready for upgrade; was a great partner to fly with during this [situation]. He was eager to divide responsibilities. He flew the aircraft and talked with ATC as I read the QRC then QRH. Knowing the systems and the likelihood of the air conditioning packs as a source of trouble; I directed the First Officer to secure both packs. As we worked through the QRH; the checklist confirmed that shutting off the packs was going to be part of the troubleshooting process.We made one error which I would like to highlight for the purpose of enlightening other Crews to be on the lookout for repeating this same error: We were given quick vectors to recover to landing in a short time. This left us short on time to 'properly' prepare for landing in an orderly fashion.Adding to this self-imposed sense of urgency was the fact that we were wearing oxygen masks. The desire to 'end' the evolution with a sense of urgency led us to accept a prompt set of vectors to land. Since it was a 'Smoke; Fire; Fumes' Checklist; there is an ever-present sense of urgency and desire to get back on deck as soon as possible. This is my 'General Safety' concern.Specifically; while slowing and configuring for landing on final; approaching 150 knots; we realized that we had failed to set VREF and VARGET. This reminded us that we had not retrieved landing data via ACARS; as we would 'normally' do. My First Officer quickly selected the FMC default values; which I judged to be satisfactory; especially as we knew that we were intentionally performing an overweight landing owing to the nature of the [situation].In hindsight; I allowed the aircraft to slow without a solid plan and without having communicated a set plan for the approach. This 'speed error' was trapped; but we could have easily gotten slower; given all of the distractions. We also failed to use [weight and balance system] to gather requisite landing data. This is a procedural error; which we accepted owing to task prioritization.Needless to say; using oxygen masks is a huge and primary distraction. It makes communication of all sorts very problematic. It impedes and precludes 'normal' conversational speech to which we are accustomed. This is my first; ever experience in the 737 flying an approach and landing while wearing an oxygen mask.I think that we failed to 'assess the risk' associated with not running a normal Descent-Approach-Landing Checklist sequence. Also; because of the difficulties in communication while using oxygen masks; we restrained ourselves from speaking; excessively (or 'normally').I want to add that once we were established and had found our rhythm of breathing; then keying the MIC to speak; we felt very comfortable and confident. We both felt like we were completely unimpeded by the oxygen masks - i.e. no problems with vision obstruction or clarity nor mobility in the cockpit. It was almost like we weren't wearing them; except for the fact that we wanted to speak as little as possible!Simply put; the oxygen mask usage causes simultaneous failures to communicate; the loop is left open and the sender does not know if the receiver even heard what was said or if it was heard correctly. Once using oxygen masks; one must very deliberately repeat; interrogate and confirm that messages have been received; understood and acted upon. It takes deliberate follow-through and demands excessive communication at a time when both pilots are seeking to minimize conversation and distracting sounds/noises.",,"While climbing out of ZZZ; we stopped our climb at 4;000 [feet] and reported to ZZZ Departure that we had unusual fumes in the cockpit and cabin. Moments earlier the flight attendants at both stations had chimed us to tell us about the fumes; which were apparent in the cabin. We donned our oxygen masks; and completed the QRC Checklist. The PIC handed control of the aircraft and radios to me and continued to work the problem and the QRH. The PIC communicated with the flight attendants and the passengers. I handled the aircraft and communicated with ZZZ Departure to coordinate our return to ZZZ. We [advised ATC] and returned to ZZZ on Runway 10 approximately 15 minutes after our initial departure. The aircraft was stopped on Runway 10 while ARFF Crews examined the exterior and the Captain made sure everything was fine in the cabin. We then taxied to our gate where the passengers were deplaned; and arrangements made to continue to ZZZ1.We all worked well as a group; there was great communication between the flight attendants; pilots and passengers. ATC and ARFF handled our [situation] with professionalism. Only a few minor things could have gone better. One example of this was the Diversion Checklist. Most of the items were completed; but not because we read the checklist itself. It may have gone even smoother if we had gone to the Diversion Checklist after the QRH. Maybe a note at the end of the QRH Checklist to do the Diversion Checklist could help. Another minor item was talking with Dispatch. We sent a quick ACARS to Dispatch but didn't have a chance to ACARS back or call them until we landed at ZZZ. Dispatch did send performance numbers for weight and balance as well as landing performance via ACARS.Given that the SMOKE; FIRE or FUMES Checklist is long and somewhat difficult to get through; we completed it in a timely manner and returned to ZZZ safely.We used our oxygen mask for the whole event; communication proved to be easier than we expected; and we didn't feel it prevented us from having any further difficulties getting the aircraft back to ZZZ.",,"B737-800 flight crew reported a fumes event shortly after takeoff resulting a return to departure airport.",

With that said;How can I verify this for transparency; for each aircraft that I am flying on?1. ZZZ-ZZZ1; Flight # XXXX Serious illness work environment safety concern. After two hours of flying on this aircraft I started experiencing chronic symptoms (Listlessness; Headaches; Fatigue;) are just some of the symptoms I was experiencing as well as C-Flight Attendant and the inbound B- Flight Attendant briefly told me of her illnesses she was experiencing as well. I noticed that when we were on the ground and the galley doors were open; the symptoms went away. This continued all day to the point that I thought I was going to have to call scheduling to be pulled. I believe that this aircraft should be examined for whatever made me and my colleagues work environment physically fatigue.2. ZZZ2-ZZZ3; Flight # XXXYThe crew experienced jet fumes from the aircraft on takeoff from ZZZ2. When we landed in ZZZ3; the A and B Flight Attendants brought it to my attention how severely heavy the fumes they experienced on takeoff. These fumes weren't as heavily present in the back of the aircraft as the A and B Flight Attendants were experiencing. These aircraft fumes side effects caused me to experience a slight headache and pain in my eyes.3. Flight # XXXZ; ZZZ4-ZZZ5After 45 minutes into this flight; I started feeling symptoms; headaches; eye pain; feeling if I was going to faint; and nauseous. No; I am not pregnant! I woke up that morning feeling perfectly fine. Like I said before; the symptoms didn't start until 45 minutes after my first departure. The odor didn't appear to be as prevalent to me as it were for the inbound crew. I'm sure that whatever product they use to disinfect the carpet for that aircraft probably contributed to my temporary illness. In between flights I would step off the aircraft to get fresh air; this helped alleviate the symptoms and when my shift was over and I was off the aircraft I noticed the symptoms disappeared; so I know for a fact that the aircraft cabin environment was causing my symptoms.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported three prior fume events resulting physiological issues.",

I; at the same time; smelled a 'Dirty socks odor'. This is the 2nd time that in flight I have smelled this odor. [The First Officer] called the flight attendants and they reported the same odor FWD and Aft in the cabin. I told the [First Officer] to don his O2 mask and put mine on also. As I was the Pilot Flying; I handled ATC and flew while [the First Officer] contacted Dispatch through ACARS and sent a return to field message. I told ATC we needed to return to ZZZ and was quickly given a vector back to ZZZ. I noticed my mask's face shield was rather cloudy/dirty and hard to see out of. We returned fairly quickly. At 1;000 feet AGL I had to remove my mask in order to see well enough in order to land the aircraft. My mask was off for approximately 5 minutes. After clearing the runway and stopping I put my mask back on. We taxied to a gate where we were met by paramedics.After deplaning and speaking to paramedics on the jetway; I noticed several symptoms. I felt dizzy and lost my balance approximately 4 times; where I had to hold the wall of the jet way to steady myself. I could think of what I wanted to say but the word would not come out of my mouth. I could talk but not say exactly what I wanted to. I also had a sore throat. I felt disoriented and overwhelmed. I finally sat down on the edge of the jetway. I saw three men in suits standing together a little ways further up the jetway. None of them introduced themselves or offered any assistance. The whole crew was taken to [a local hospital] by ambulance. I was released approximately 5 hours later. I have had multiple health affects since that day. It was determined that the APU had an internal oil leak. The aircraft had another fume event on the line during passenger operations on a [recent flight]. This is an ongoing and known problem. This problem can be addressed by taking seriously the health risks caused by TCP (Tricresyl Phosphate) in the engine and APU oil. The Airbus aircraft have a high risk to the bleed air system because the APU air inlet is on the bottom of the aircraft and is easily able to ingest oil into the bleed air system where it is heated up and can enter the cabin and cockpit as a neurotoxin. To this day; I have no memory of actually landing the aircraft.",,,,"A319 Captain reported a fumes event shortly after takeoff which resulted in an uneventful return to departure airport.

We also had a [deadheading] FO in the main cabin during this flight and event. I briefed all my FA's before the passengers boarded as I do each and every flight. FO did the walk around no issues noted. Logbook review noted #4 tire replaced on [date]. Later review of logbook while completing abort info noted the #2 brake assembly was replaced 10 days prior to this flight on [date]. All briefs; checklists; engine start; ramp taxi and ground taxi to Runway XXR was completely normal. Tower issued us takeoff clearance and I taxied the aircraft onto the centerline and gave [FO] the aircraft. It was his takeoff and leg to ZZZ1. He flew the leg to ZZZ2 to start the trip sequence and I flew the return leg to ZZZ.Takeoff roll; engine power setting and acceleration all normal to 80 knot callout. Immediately after that the aircraft pulled/yawed to the left and [FO] returned the aircraft to runway centerline with right rudder. Wind was down the runway so this was somewhat unusual. Shortly after 100 knots the aircraft pulled/yawed even more violently than before to the left and this time I heard some kind of noise from the left side. My initial impression was a possible blown tire or some kind of mechanical malfunction based on the sound I heard. Our FO [deadheading] in main cabin told me afterward he felt the aircraft yaw two times and heard the same mechanical malfunction noise on the second pull/yaw as well. [FO] again used more right rudder to realign the nose of the aircraft to the runway centerline and simultaneously stated out loud 'Something is wrong.' We were approximately midfield and 135 -140 knots and I elected to reject the takeoff based on the second more severe pull; sound and [FO]'s statement of the aircraft's condition. I announced 'Abort; Abort; Abort' (as I said I might say on our first leg initial brief just because that is what I have used in my aviation career) and 'My Aircraft.' The abort was instantaneous with the throttles pulled to idle. The ground spoilers deployed immediately and the autobrakes grabbed on just like a 'max brake' landing. With very little correction runway centerline was maintained during the abort procedure and brake chatter started around 100 knots on the deceleration. I elected to override the brakes due to anti-skid cycling and manually stopped the aircraft on centerline around 8500 feet down the runway. [FO] contacted ZZZ Tower announcing our abort. After the aircraft was completely stopped I made a PA to both the FA's and passengers. This was my first high speed abort in my aviation career and I am sure for [FO] and the FA's as well. We asked Tower if they could see if we had a blown left tire. They said no.  No blown tires; no hot brakes; no fluids and no damage to our aircraft [was reported]. After communicating with ZZZ OPS for a ramp/gate we [were] cleared to taxi to the ramp. The aircraft didn't move. Attempted to taxi again with no movement. I cycled the parking brake (which has NOT been applied during this entire event and never was until aircraft shutdown) just to be sure it was NOT engaged somehow. Informed Ground Control we would have to call for a tug and get maintenance assistance. ZZZ OPS was notified of our situation. During the 20 minute wait we contacted our Dispatcher about our rejected takeoff on Runway XXR. We didn't need any further assistance from him at that time. Maintenance arrived with ZZZ Maintenance Supervisor hooking up on the ground headset. He and I communicated for the next 30 minutes or more on the remainder of procedures they tried. First they confirmed no flat/blown tires; no hot brakes; no fluid leaks and no damage. They had me 'pump' the brakes while brake technicians looked over our wheels. Second they hooked up a tug and tried to push the aircraft backward to either release the brakes or remove any debris from failed brakes. No movement. Then they tried to pull the aircraft forward. No movement. We 'pumped' the brakesagain and tried a second time with the tug. No movement. Supervisor said the brakes may have failed; fused; locked or been damaged somehow. He also stated we have had many similar situations with these particular brakes in the past. I explained to him what we felt and heard during the takeoff roll. He said he expected to find some kind of failure after they performed an inspection.Supervisor and I communicated more about the AML write ups for the abort and the aircraft info that needed to be included. He was outstanding in communicating what was happening under our aircraft and later what they found with the #1 and #2 brakes. We rejected our takeoff between 135 and 140 knots; our weight was 153;000 LBS. and our fuel weight was 24;000 LBS. I rejected the takeoff because of many quick decisions. A) The aircraft yawing/pulling left (harder the second time) with the unusual noise either a blown tire or mechanical failure; B) [FOs] direct comment 'Something is wrong' justified the aircraft was unsafe to fly in my opinion and C) We were halfway down [the runway] approximately 15 knots below V1. [FO] and I were shown brakes #2 by the Maintenance personnel who already had the aircraft on jacks left side and wheel #2 off. There are 5 or 6 brake elements and the outer two could rotate but inner 3 or 4 damaged; fused or failed somehow. The mechanics suspected that brakes #1 were going to be the same. Later [name] told me that in fact brakes #1 were the same failed; fused or locked. We were called by ZZZ Chief Pilot on Duty who came down and debriefed with me. We contacted Crew Tracking and informed them we were finished for the night. [Deadheading] FO later contacted me about this entire rejected takeoff event. He confirmed to me exactly what I recalled during this abort and he told me he actually expected us to abort the takeoff based on what he felt and heard sitting back in main cabin. He also verified how professional our FAs performed and interacted with our passengers during the entire time. My thanks to [our] First Officer. He was on top of everything helping with decisions and doing most of the communications.I suspect that there was a brake failure on either or both of the left side brakes #1 or #2 during our takeoff roll based on the aircraft diversions from runway centerline in a very noticeable pull or yaw two different times as the aircraft accelerated. Also the noticeable noise that I heard from the left side of the aircraft during the second more pronounced aircraft pull/yaw. We occasionally get a rejected takeoff scenario in our [recurrent] training that may be given with a 'blown tire scenario.' I; personally; have never experienced a blown tire either. I believe we have many documented cases of blown tires with aircrews on both takeoff and landing. I also believe we have had 737 brake failures of many different kinds either during taxi or takeoff/landing rolls. We might need more discussion about the feel; sounds and expectations associated with both of these type of events because I believe most of our [Company] aircrew have never experienced either of these events as well.",,,,"B737-800 Captain reported an RTO due to a brake failure/seizure.",

Dispatch conferred with Maintenance Control regarding the low oil quantity. Based on the absence of any further abnormal indications; the decision was made to continue. I continued to advise Dispatch of further decreases in oil quantity via ACARS messages.

The A Flight Attendant came to the back and said she couldn't see due to the customers (full flight). We decided to ask them to get up we needed to observe something. We had to ask 3 different rows of passengers in order to fully observe the entire engine casing. We reported we didn't see any oil that looked fresh. We all agreed to stay informed of any changes and continue to watch for any oil. We then got a call from the Captain to suspend service. Things were declining and he was on the radio with Dispatch approximately and hour from my understanding. We all three shut down galleys and double latched in preparation for things to possibly not improve. We then got a call we were diverting.We contacted the cockpit as to inquire what actions to take. The Captain was still on radio with dispatch. Clean up and be seated was all he was able to relay as they were very busy. We gathered our planned emergency cards and reviewed our responsibilities to be prepared for the worse. I messaged my family with 'I love you' just in case things turned out bad. Our descent was abrupt due to the air breaks. The customers were deeply concerned and asking questions. The internet was turned off. The cabin was quiet and things felt very surreal and tense. We made our landing safely and stopped for a bit on the runway; then taxied to the gate. Our pilots were pulled and scheduled to deadhead. No one contacted the flight attendants AT ALL. We were sent to gate XX to continue on with our day on a different aircraft. Our C Flight Attendant was visibly shaken; her knees felt weak and she was on the verge of crying. She called scheduling and Company Communications System and she was pulled when we arrived in ZZZ. After speaking with the Captain who was deadheading; he came to speak to us during the flight to ZZZ. After finding out how dire the situation was and how rapidly things declined; that he shut down our engine; it hit me.I began to tremble; I became very distraught that we were not taken into consideration of how this may have affected us. We worked the flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 in a daze. My service was horrible. My thoughts were everywhere and I felt extremely distraught when we learned neither Dispatch nor anyone else EVER inquired about the Flight Attendant crew. I couldn't think and fought back my tears. I can tell you our crew WAS affected. It was frightening and intense. I was made aware that the Company Communications System told our C Flight Attendant that they were told there was NO impact on the flight attendants. NO ONE asked. Our A Flight Attendant lost her place in the opening PA on the segment to ZZZ due to the stress. We could not think. If there is an incident and pilots are pulled the entire crew should be given the same consideration. I would like to believe we are just as valued as them. It is after all our job to get these people out should it come to that.We all are a crew; we all are in this together as a crew; every one of us should be valued and cared about equally. With the initial event the adrenaline kicks in along with our training you can put on your A game. Once the event is over and the adrenaline has subsided; the incident along with all the possible outcomes begin to sink in along with the anxiety; fear; and associated post traumatic issues. Then you are hustled over to carry on and work another flight. What state would a crew be in to handle another event?

The FO (First Officer) was the Flying Pilot on this leg. The FO asked first; if I smelled smoke. I said I did. I finished the after takeoff checklist and called the flight attendants on the inter-phone and asked if the ovens were on and asked if they smelled anything. I think at first they said no and the ovens were off. I turned on cockpit dome light to see if I could see smoke. I could not. The FO said he is going on oxygen. I said good idea. I called the flight attendants again and now they smelled something burning. I told them we are turning around and we'd be on the ground in a few minutes.I [requested priority handling with ATC] and put on my oxygen mask. The FO took over the radio and told ATC we need to return to ZZZ. I was having trouble communicating to the FO. He was on oxygen and head set; I was on oxygen and speaker. I heard ATC clear us direct to ZZZ. I tried to change destination in the FMGC. It was not immediately apparent to do this so I instead put in direct to ZZZ. I then put on my head set and confirmed communicating with the FO. [It] wasn't until this point that I actually stated you have the aircraft and radio. I sent an ACARS to Dispatch. All I had time to text was [7700 ZZZ SMOKE].I finally loaded ZZZ as a new destination and I put in XXL in the FMGC then asked what runway he wanted. He ask for XXR. I changed it to XXR. He asked me for direct ZZZZZ. The FO asked if I wanted to drop the mask for passengers. I said NO - I explained why later. ZZZZZ wasn't line selectable so I gave him ZZZZZ1 instead. I took over the radio and notified ATC that we were now direct ZZZZZ1. I asked ATC to have Crash Fire Rescue meet us on the runway. I saw we were below 3;000 feet; so I switched the weather radar off and put terrain on and asked FO if he'd like 2;200 feet in the altitude window for the approach fix floor instead of 2;000 feet.

I tried to call the FAs (Flight Attendant) but there was too much side tone to hear because [of] our oxygen mask; though off; were on intercom. I needed to know if we had actually smoke or fire so I directed the FO to jump in the back and have a look.CFR called as soon as the FO left the flight deck and said no fire or hot spots but a little smoke from bottom of engine one. I shut engine 1 down normal. No flight deck indications of smoke or fire at any time. Just smell. I got the speaker set and intercom off and talked to FAs. They said everything was okay. I made my first and only PA explaining CFR around us. With the FO back we decided to taxi to the gate with CFR to follow. The smoke smell was gone.

There was also a write up from the previous flight for one of the Engine Fire loops so we quickly discussed if that may have factored into the issue. Upon reaching a safe altitude; airspeed; and configuration; the Captain increased power in the Number 1 thrust level and we noticed no issues with the engine. It was. A few moments later; with both thrust levers in the climb detent; we attempted to climb and when the engines returned to full power; we noticed the Number 1 EGT slowly creeping up towards 790 degrees; about 40-50 degrees higher than the Number 2 engine. The engine Fire ECAM returned again and the Captain pulled back the Number 1 thrust lever which rectified the situation again. We decided to divert to ZZZ1. We ran all appropriate checklists; including the overweight landing checklist and a landing assessment. The Captain made an uneventful landing on Runway XXR and; after an inspection by the fire department; taxied to the gate.",,"Engine Fire Number 1 Warning received soon after gear retraction on takeoff.

Approaching approximately 4;000 ft. ATC issued a Traffic Warning 'pop up traffic 5 miles 4;000 ft. converging; moments later I had visual on the traffic and requested a hard right turn to avoid. We turned approximately 90 degrees right. When clear of traffic we were vectored left turn back to the airport. The First Officer (Pilot Flying) who was familiar with the airport said he had the airport I called the field insight and we began approach to Runway 4. Initially we were on glideslope and PAPI but no Localizer. I verified that ILS frequencies were correct. Then glideslope started showing us low still on PAPI. I concluded something was amiss and called for a go around with ATC. ATC said they suspected we were lined up on Runway 5 at GHY approximately 10 miles to the west with no previous warning. We were given vectors back to a 19 miles downwind cleared to OXBY and cleared ILS Runway 4 at GSP. Approach and landing was normal and standard. I canceled IFR clearance on the ground (Tower was closed) and continued to the gate.There were several circumstances that contributed to this event; first and foremost was the traffic alert at low altitude that required evasive action. After being turned back to the airport a bit task saturated led to some navigational and situational awareness being a bit behind. This is why I elected to initiate a go around. This gave us the crew time to set up the approach with no traffic distractions and conduct a normal standard approach and landing to the airport. In addition this was the First Officer flying first line trip after completing IOE with 29 hours in the B737. As pilot monitoring; I needed to be more attentive than flying with a pilot with more experience. Had the Tower been open and operating may have also helped in this situation.",,,,"B737 Captain reported distraction and workload due to a traffic conflict that caused them to line up with the wrong runway.",

An A320 was given clearance to cross the landing runway from right to left when I was approximately 900 ft. AGL. Crossing aircraft was slow to cross and cleared the landing runway when I was 100-200 ft. AGL. During flare with thrust levers at idle the aircraft rolled uncommanded to the left. I countered the roll with right aileron correction and a balloon ensued. I chose to go around at that point; but due to energy state; engine spool up time and ground proximity the main landing gear touched down before becoming airborne again. Almost immediately after becoming airborne we got master caution alerts and ECAM advisories of flight control malfunctions. Being the Pilot Flying I maintained control and asked what was going on. FO (First Officer) informed me that the autopilot was inoperative and he believed us to be in Alternate Law. We cleaned up the aircraft and both verified the ailerons were inoperative on the F/CTL page and roll control was available via spoilers. The aircraft had reverted to Alternate Law and was verifiable by indications on the PFD.I gave FO the responsibility of flying the aircraft and ATC as I referred to QRH pg 62 F/CTL L(R) AIL FAULT. The procedure simply states that if both ailerons were deflected we would use more fuel. I did a landing assessment with our current state and verified we needed approximately 5700 ft. of runway. I [Requested Priority Handling] and since I had no idea why we were in Alternate Law; I felt the safest course of action was to return ASAP to ZZZ for a landing as opposed to trying a computer reset. I had full roll and pitch authority and didn't know what would happen if I tried to reset the computer; nor did I know which ELAC was inoperative. A normal approach and landing was made to Runway XXL. No limitations were exceeded. I attribute the whole scenario to the slowly crossing aircraft. I have never had an uncommanded roll in the flare during landing. From now on if a crossing aircraft has not cleared the landing runway by the time I get to 400 ft.

The painted red plastic cover was missing and the bottom appeared scraped. The indicator decal on the skirt of the tail skid was showing green. The aircraft proceeded through the flight without disruption and arrived without further incident. As the damage went unknown through the flight; if it had been we would have executed the procedure established in the QRH directing us to depressurize and land at the nearest suitable airport.Upon further review of performance details and recollection regarding the flight afterward; it appears as though the aircraft was in an overweight situation on takeoff. I have recalled at the beginning of climb; the stick shaker vibrated very briefly and back pressure was decreased to compensate for this abnormality. When executing performance inputs via the company iPad performance software; both pilots verified the input details and CG corrections and the software accepted it. The corresponding data was entered into the FMC and reviewed by both pilots.ATC had advised us through a relay from the Panama departure ATC of a possible part left on the runway and were unable to provide a description. As there were no tactile indications or other; the damage to the tail skid went unknown until postflight checks were completed.On takeoff too much back pressure was applied. Lack of recent and continual experience with the NG (Next Generation) may have contributed to this; as prior to this flight I had only flown the NG once this year; and with the last recorded entry. Further analysis of performance indicates an unintentional overweight takeoff that contributed to this event.

I as relief pilot told the Captain that I would go back and assess the situation. When I arrived in the aft galley there in fact were several smoking ovens with real smoke. We immediately de-powered the galley and removed all food from the ovens. I called to Captain and told him that I was concerned that it was an issue different than spilled food because 6 of the 8 ovens were billowing smoke. There was no sign of spilled food or grease in any of the ovens. At that point the Captain advised ATC and made a turn to return to ZZZ for landing. I maintained coordination with the flight attendants and had them de-power all the galleys in the airplane including pulling the circuit breakers. I returned to the cockpit and took over all communications with Dispatch; the flight attendants; the passengers; and Crash Fire Rescue on the ground in ZZZ.

Crash Fire Rescue indicated the engine looked secure and we single engine taxi back to the gate with one fire vehicle following. The only out of order steps that the Captain chose to do after [requesting priority handling] was to start the APU immediately. While the First Officer was completing the extensive checklist the Captain also turned off the flap inhibit switch; selected flaps 15 speeds in the FMC and turned the engine ignition on the good engine to CONT. The Captain decided to use Captains Authority for this checklist deviation as configuring for a single engine landing was more preferred than a complex high altitude go around with terrain at Las Vegas. The First Officer followed up with all of these items as he completed the checklists at 1;000 ft. Upon debrief with Maintenance it appeared through data link that it was #4 engine bearing seal failure and N1 seized.",,"Approaching ZZZ; we heard a pop with accompanying vibrations in the aircraft yawed and rolled to the right.

Both the Captain and First Officer verified engine failure with the right (number two) engine; the Captain executed the critical actions and directed the Engine Fire; Severe Engine Damage; and Engine Separation QRC. Both crew members slowed down to verify the correct engine prior to shutting down the malfunctioning engine. The First Officer performed the QRH followed by the One Engine Inoperative Landing checklists.

The First Officer coordinated with fire response for escort back to the gate; where we parked and deplaned. The First Officer then completed the logbook entry. The only out of step items the Captain accomplished was to select CONT on the operating engine; select the flap inhibit switch; immediately start the APU and select flaps 15 speeds in the FMC.

At approximately XA:45 near ZZZ1 airport and approximately 40 minutes from landing; we received the ECAM Cautions HYD G RSVR LO LVL; G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR; AND G SYS LO PR. These indications of a loss of Green Hydraulic System Quantity were confirmed by the Hydraulic page indicating no quantity in the Green system. I stated 'my aircraft' and we proceeded with the FIX (Fly Identify Execute) strategy. The FO/PM (First Officer / Pilot Flying) checked the QRC (Quick Reference Checklist) and determined it was not an Immediate Action or ECAM exception. I transferred aircraft control to the FO and accomplished the ECAM procedures. Then referenced the QRH for follow up procedures. We also received a call from a flight attendant informing us that they heard a loud noise that sounded like the hydraulic pump and then it stopped. I asked if she could see any fluid or other indications and she said she didn't. I thanked her for the information and informed her we were running a procedure and to contact me if she noticed anything further. After completing the ECAM and QRH follow-up procedures we formulated a plan. We would [request priority handling] with ATC. We were now just a few minutes from start of descent into ZZZ; and we determined a landing at ZZZ would be the safest and most appropriate point of landing. From the procedures; we knew that we would have to gravity extend the gear; the flap/slats would be slow; we would need to accomplish an abnormal landing assessment; normal braking was INOP (Inoperative) but we had alternate braking with Anti-Skid; and nose wheel steering was INOP. This would require at least a 15 mile final to accomplish the Gravity Gear Extension Procedure and to account for slow moving Flaps. Due to inoperative nose wheel steering we would not be able to taxi and a full stop on the runway with a tow in to gate would be required. We also wanted Fire Equipment standing by and wanted to be inspected upon stopping regarding the fluid leak. I instructed the FO to send a message to dispatch to communicate our emergency and plan; and to prepare for arrival/landing at ZZZ. I [requested priority landing] with ATC and communicated our problem and plan; including our intention to full stop Runway XX and require a tow in. After this; I ran the Non-Routine Landings Consideration Checklist in the QRH. I contacted the FA's and communicated our emergency and our plan for a precautionary landing and tow-in. I made a PA to do the same for the passengers. We performed a normal descent on the ZZZZZ arrival to Runway XX. At the appropriate time I gave control of the aircraft back to the FO and extended the landing gear using the QRH L/G Gravity Extension Procedure. I resumed aircraft control after the gear was down and locked and the procedure was completed. We made a normal landing. Aircraft control was noticeably more difficult than I was expecting decelerating through 80 kts. with only differential braking but we maintained centerline just fine. After coming to a stop I made the PA to remain seated and that we would be inspected by safety vehicles. The safety vehicles performed their inspection and informed us of an obvious hydraulic leak on the number one engine. After performing the after landing flows; we shut down both engines. Dispatch had already coordinated with operations for the tow in crew and they met the aircraft within a few minutes. We were towed into the gate with one of the fire vehicles following us.

I heard the Flight Attendant make a PA for medical personnel to ring their call button. A few moments later; we got a call from the Flight Attendants. The Captain answered. The Flight Attendant told him that a passenger was unconscious in the back. We began to prepare for a possible medical diversion. I pulled up the QRG Medical Guide and Diversion Planning Guide and we starting reviewing. The Flight Attendant called back a short time later and said that medical personnel on board believed the passenger was having a stroke and recommended landing. We immediately sent a message via ACARS and started discussing diversion option while trying to reach Dispatch and Medical. The Captain began pulling weather; etc. After not getting a response from Dispatch; we sent another message via ACARS and continued discussing options. I'm not sure how much time went by; but it was too long. We sent one more 'call me' via ACARS and I queried ATC to get an ARINC frequency. She was able to provide one. I called ARINC and requested our dispatch and desk number. At this point; the situation in the back with the passenger had not improved. We got Dispatch on the radio and tried to discuss what was happening and requested Medical; but we were having extreme difficulty understanding and communicating with dispatch. Given the medical situation and our inability to adequately communicate with dispatch; the Captain suggested that we go ahead and divert to ZZZ. I fully agreed with his suggestion and he implemented the command decision. We diverted and landed. We had to work around some weather and set up for the approach. Also; [we requested priority handling]. We fully prepared; briefed; ran checklists as well as referred to the diversion guide for guidance. All items were completed and we kept our speed up below 10;000 ft. as we felt the [situation] warranted expediting to the field; we informed ATC of our speed.The major concern in this incident was our inability to effectively communicate with Dispatch. We never received an answer to our 3 'call me' ACARS messages; and when we got them on the radio; we couldn't understand due to poor radio coverage. In the debrief; we discussed it and both expressed that we felt like we were somewhat on our own making the decisions. Given our resources and time constraints; we chose ZZZ as we felt it was a close 'sure bet' for providing care; as well as suitable to land; on the list of serviced airports; etc. It would have been helpful to converse with Dispatch on these decisions; and also; to speak with Medical prior to diverting; but it wasn't feasible given the Comms. Given the challenges; the Captain did an absolute superb job commanding the situation. I would say that our crew effectiveness and CRM was excellent and we worked the problem together successfully.",,,,"B737 pilot reported an inflight passenger medical emergency that resulted in an immediate diversion.",

Jumpseating off-duty [pilot] was riding in the back. Departed on Runway XXL; normal operations with no indications of any engine abnormalities. Passing through 27;000 ft.; [there was a] loud bang; [the] aircraft shuddered; and yawed slowly to the left. After the bang; ENG 1 N1 rolled back - [the] trend arrow for N1 on engine indications decreased to near idle. Due to our high deck angle; being heavy; and at an altitude where we normally lose a lot of available climb thrust; there was an immediate loss of airspeed. Although FO was flying; CA (Captain) reached over and selected 20;000 ft. to start and pulled open descent to prevent any further climb and lowered the nose. We then called ATC to [request priority handling] and initiated a 180 degree turn back to the airport. ECAM actions were started for the ECAM 'ENG high engine vibrations.' ECAM directed us to apply High ENG Vibrations QRH. While in the middle of QRH; FA (Flight Attendant) had called to ask us questions. I quickly told her that we were having some engine issues; plane was under control; but I would need to call her back with a TEST since we were still taking care of the situation. ATC then gave us direct to ZZZ and descend to 10;000 ft. Descent rate was normal and did not exceed approximately 2;500 fpm.At this point; about 2-3 minutes had elapsed since the initial bang. N1 on engine #1 never got above approximately 40-50% N1... thrust seemed minimal. ENG #1 then failed and auto shut-downed for about 10 seconds; then auto-restarted as we noticed the AVAIL light appear. I resumed the high vibration QRH and were about to coordinate reducing engine #1 thrust to control the vibrations when ENG #1 failed again. FA called again and quickly told her I'd call her back. We decided to switch gears and do ECAM actions for ENG #1 Fail. We secured ENG #1 per ECAM and completed ECAM actions. Due to the loud bang and initial high vibrations; we elected to blow the fire protection squib as well. Yaw of aircraft was affected with thrust changes from engine #1 failing and restarting.Weather and numbers were pulled up to confirm that we could land safely in ZZZ on XYL and weather was still ok. I then called the FA to brief her on the situation and gave her a TEST briefing. She then informed me that there was smoke in the cabin and passengers reported fire coming from engine #1. I told her that was probably residual smoke from the engine failure but if the smoke persisted then to call me back and we would reassess the situation from there. There were no fire indications in the cockpit so I proceeded as planned. [The Jumpseater off-duty pilot] at this time had made FA's aware that he could be of help and we let him in with the door keypad. CA briefed him on the situation and asked him to call Dispatch and specifically watch our ENG #2 for any abnormalities. Made a PA to passengers sometime during this time advising them we had an engine failure; aircraft was flying fine and that we would be returning to ZZZ in 25 minutes.We needed more time to finish last QRH's for overweight landing and SE (Single Engine) straight in approach. I requested a PPOS (Present Position) hold for 5 minutes. We then continued and finished the overweight landing QRH and single-engine straight in approach QRH's. We then held in the vicinity of ZZZ and expressed to crew that if there was anything that happened to our #2 Engine that we had ZZZ1 MCAS at our disposal. At this point; Engine #2 displayed no abnormal indications. CA set up the approach; briefed approach; then switched controls so CA was now PF (Pilot Flying) for remainder of flight. Approach checklist was completed and we advised ATC we were ready for the approach as well as confirming that ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) would be standing by for us. CA also checked in with FA's to see if smoke was still an issue since crew didn't smell anything. They confirmed that the cabin was clear and everyone was ready for approach. I also made one last PA to passengers advising them our ETA and that fire trucks will be assessing us on the runway.Turned on APU Bleed to power packs as per overweight landing checklist. LDA XYL approach in to a normal landing. Full stop; made a PA for passengers to remain seated. We had requested a discrete code for ARFF but it was not working on ground so we just talked to firemen on Tower. Firetrucks looked us over with particular attention to engine; gear; tires and cabin damage. Firemen gave us the ok and we elected to remain emergency aircraft and taxi back to gate with trucks following us in the case of any other issues. We also elected to leave flaps down in full position as I wasn't certain if there was any damage to flap fairings or flap area. Taxied to the gate; canceled emergency with ARFF reaching alley; pulled into Gate XX; and shutdown secured aircraft per SOP.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"A321 flight crew reported experiencing a compressor stall and subsequent failure of the #1 engine resulting in a return to the departure airport.",

An hour into the flight; we were cruising at FL380. We received a call from the Number 1 Flight Attendant letting us know that there was an odor in the back of the aircraft that smelled like burning wire. He said he could smell it from about 3 rows from the aft galley. No smoke was seen. The Captain asked about the 2 flight attendants in the back. The Number 1 stated they felt a little nausea and headache; but they were doing okay. At that point; the Captain elected to [advise ATC] and land at ZZZ1. We were about 40nm from ZZZ1. I continued flying while the Captain coordinated with ATC; the Company; and the flight attendants. Captain also made a PA to the passengers. We were given radar vectors to land on RWY XXC. We landed uneventful on [Runway] XXC and stopped on the runway. We talked with ARFF and had them check the aircraft for smoke and anything out of the ordinary. ARFF said they saw nothing and we continued to the gate with ARFF following us. Once parked at the gate; the passengers deplaned. The two flight attendants in the back deplaned and were met by the EMTs and checked out. Maintenance boarded and checked the aircraft for possible sources of the smell.

Normal taxi-out and departure from runway. Climbed to FL330 in smooth air and first 45 minutes of flight unremarkable. FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying) and Captain PM (Pilot Monitoring). Engine 1 experienced a stall accompanied by partial EPR rollback on ENG 1 and an ECAM 'ENG 1 STALL.' FO retained control of flying and took radios and Captain began ECAM and QRH. Engine recovered itself with no action required and remained stable with no further indications of a stall.Crew resumed normal PF/PM duties and we reviewed the ENG 1 STALL QRH to ensure all considerations taken. We discussed monitoring engine and reviewed the driftdown QRC items to be prepared should another event occur. FO reviewed our single engine performance capability to confirm capability at present weight. Captain shared event information with [Company] Maintenance via ACARS and notified Dispatch. All parties believed it was a momentary event and engine was operating normally.A second; deeper Engine 1 Stall occurred about 35 minutes later and again FO remained the PF and took communications so Captain could run the ECAM and QRH. Per the procedure when thrust was slowly brought back up on Engine 1 further vibrations and stalls began and thrust lever was returned to idle where engine idled with normal indications. We coordinated a driftdown with ATC while we completed our analysis of the engine status and advised ATC working a degraded engine situation. Dispatch was also advised; and closest airports were reviewed with consideration to single engine performance ability as well as overweight landing performance for a weight of 150;000 pounds.Captain decided safest plan was to land in ZZZ; [Requested Priority Handling] with ATC and advised Flight Attendants of plan. Dispatch was advised of diversion to ZZZ with degraded engine. A brief passenger announcement was also made. Flight attendants advised Captain passenger was not feeling well and oxygen was being administered. A medically trained passenger was assisting crew with the ill passenger. A pass-rider Flight Attendant also stepped up to assist cabin crew for balance of flight.We prepared and briefed a descent to ZZZ and requested Runway XXL. Performance data received from Dispatch and Captain elected to fly the descent and approach. FO provided excellent PM and callouts. An uneventful landing on ZZZ XXL completed with [airport rescue and firefighting] equipment positioned on the adjacent taxiway. Aircraft was able to safely taxi to gate with a fire truck escort.Maintenance release codes were sent for ENG 1 STALL ECAMs and a used oxygen bottle. A phone call to [Technical Support Maintenance Control] was made by Captain as well to log the overweight landing and describe events. Captain and FO debriefed in ZZZ to review CRM elements and outcome. Crew deadheaded back to ZZZ1 later in the afternoon.",,"We had an inflight engine stall that resulted in a reduction of power on the number 1 engine. The flight started with no unusual indications departing; it was my leg to fly. Climbout to FL330 was normal; smooth air and no icing conditions. About 45 mins into the flight; we had our first engine issue. In cruise flight the Captain and I heard a loud sound and the number 1 engine EPR starting to reduce; a few seconds later the ECAM 'engine 1 stall' appeared briefly. The number 1 engine had recovered; returning to normal operating conditions. At this point the Captain ran the associated QRH to completion with the number 1 engine continuing to operate normally. We discussed the situation and decided to continue; using the time wisely we reviewed where we were on our flight; roughly south of ZZZ2. We also reviewed the drift down procedure and discussed all of our options should the number 1 engine fail on us. We reviewed the single engine performance at our current weight and the grid mora altitudes along our route of flight; FL180 was our single engine performance and 16;800 feet was the highest grid mora in the area west of ZZZ. I maintained flying the aircraft and took over ATC communications so the Captain could message Maintenance and Dispatch to get their input in our developing situation. On advice from Maintenance we submitted a write-up for engine 1 stall in level flight no shutdown. They advised to continue and they would inspect in ZZZ1. We both felt there was a possible threat with further engine problems and did everything we could to formulate a plan and mitigate all errors associated with the elevated stress of an in-flight shutdown.About 40 minutes after the first engine 1 stall; we had a second occurrence of the same nature on engine 1. First were loud bangs; shaking of the airplane; and EPR reduction with the associated ECAM. We identified the problem; the Captain announced I had the aircraft and radios; he was going to run the ECAM and QRH. After completing ECAM and QRH the engine would not go above idle thrust without problems. We both discussed the situation and decided leaving the engine at idle thrust was our best option. The engine indications were normal for idle thrust. At this point; knowing our performance was degraded on engine 1; we asked ATC for a lower altitude and advised we were working on an engine issue involving degraded performance. We completed the drift down checklist and requested FL200 while continuing on our flight plan. Below us was ZZZ3 and 180 miles ahead of us was ZZZ. As we continued to trouble shoot the engine 1 problem; message Dispatch; and analyzing our current performance we decided to continue straight ahead in a slow decent and divert to ZZZ. At this point east of ZZZ3; about 140 miles from ZZZ we [Requested Priority Handling] with ATC with our intention to divert to ZZZ. I maintained control of the aircraft and ATC communication while the Captain messaged Dispatch; the Flight Attendant; and updated the passengers on our situation and intentions. Our performance with the degraded engine 1 allowed us to level off at FL250 to setup for a normal decent into ZZZ. We prepared for landing in ZZZ XXL; the longest runway. We checked the performance numbers; added the appropriate speeds for a flaps full landing; Dispatch ran the length calculations of 7;500 feet needed (Runway XXL 16;000 feet long); checked a single engine go-around performance; ran the overweight checklist and briefed everything. Once we had our plan ready the Captain took the controls and completed a safe uneventful landing in ZZZ. We taxied to the gate normally and deplaned normally. Being new to [Company] adds stress to an event like this but the training I received including CRM skills was invaluable for us to complete this flight safely.",,"A320 flight crew reported a divert due to compressor stalls on left then right engine.",

It was immediately followed by a loud impact noise. The smell of an animal through an engine entered the aircraft. Additionally a change in air noise happened. Almost like a panel was open. A check of the engines indicated that they were both operating normally; and I also checked the pressurization which was also normal. The FO and I quickly agreed that we should level off; which ATC granted. We told them we had hit a bird and would probably be returning to ZZZ1 or maybe ZZZ. At that time the FA (Flight Attendants) called about the smell and that we had hit something on the number two engine. They indicated that there was a hole or dent in the thing that goes around the engine. I asked if everyone was alright and they said 'yes'. I told them I would get back to them with more information. When I returned; the FO indicated that ATC had requested priority handling for us. We then agreed to stay in the area while we got a plan in order. We believed (based on our aircraft being approximately 8000 lbs over max landing weight; and the possibility that there could be some issues with the leading edge devices); we decided ZZZ was where we wanted to go to. I called ZZZ1 Operations and had them have Dispatch call us on frequency. Once on with us; we told him our plan and he agreed and said he would get things coordinated at ZZZ. With the FO flying; I ran the Diversion Checklist; and also got landing information for ZZZ. ATC planned for us to land on Runway XXR. We briefed the approach and talked about it again to make sure we had done everything; and were not missing anything. I also read the overweight landing information from the AOM out loud. When all checklists and notifications were complete (and on the approach) we transferred controls so that I could land the aircraft. After landing; we cleared the runway; shut down the number 2 engine; and had airport rescue inspect the aircraft for any smoke or liquids coming from the aircraft. They said all was normal.

It looked inoperative but with the side light it was hard to tell. So I looked at the right side to compare what it should look like and confirmed that the left side was out. So at that point I continued on with my walk around. Once I got back up to the flight deck I informed the Captain of the inoperative landing light where he then completed the MEL with Maintenance Control. After pushback and engine start; it was noticed that the Captain's pitot heat light was illuminated. I continued with my After Start Flow and then we did the Before Taxi Checklist. Once that was completed we ran the QRH for the Captain Pitot light and determined it needed to be MELed. Once the paperwork was completed we continued to the runway.During the takeoff roll; where I was the Pilot Flying; the Captain called for the reject around 70 kts. We cleared the runway and ran brake cooling and determined it was safe to proceed back to the gate. Once at the gate the Captain asked me to do a quick walk around of the aircraft. As soon as I got down to the aircraft I noticed that the Captain-side pitot tube was missing from the aircraft. I was not part of the conversation that determined when the pitot tube may have departed the aircraft; but was informed that I must have missed that it was missing during my walk around. Shortly after that I recalled that after looking at the lights I must have never went back to the Captain side of the nose to start the preflight from my normal starting point. This event was a great reminder that when doing [an] important task; once you get distracted you should always start from the beginning and start the task over again so important items aren't missed.",,"FO (First Officer) returned from exterior preflight and informed me that the left fixed landing light was inoperative. We confirmed this and MELed it. After pushback; we accomplished After Start Flow and the 'Captain Pitot' light stayed on. Circuit breaker was in; and we contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via phone to MEL this. We were able to continue per the MEL and taxied for takeoff. On the takeoff roll; I noticed; at about 70 kts on the FO's side; that I had no airspeed indication. I rejected the takeoff at that point; we cleared the runway; ran the brake cooling numbers; and requested taxi back to the gate. A three minute cooling at the gate was returned.At the gate; after writing up the discrepancy; I asked the FO to do a walk around; as we were going to terminate the aircraft and likely would not take this aircraft out. He returned immediately and informed me that the entire pitot tube was missing. I was met on the jet way by Company Maintenance Personnel; working on another aircraft. After discussing various possible ways the pitot tube could have been torn off; we suspected that it had happened in or out of the gate the previous night; or on the remote pad where the aircraft overnighted. Shortly thereafter; the actual pitot tube was found on the Ramp at the remote pad. We simply missed the pitot tube damage on the originating exterior preflight. We clearly missed the damaged/missing pitot tube on preflight. The FO could have been distracted by the actual runway turnoff light in his face; or by attempting to tell if; in fact; a left fixed landing light was inoperative. Regardless; we missed the damage. We MELed the cockpit indication correctly and applied all MEL procedures properly; to my knowledge.",,"B737-700 flight crew reported a rejected takeoff due to a lack of airspeed indication on the Captain's side.",

As Pilot Monitoring; I immediately pointed the warning to the Pilot Flying and reached for QRH. While I began the appropriate QRH procedure the Pilot Flying continued the approach. At this point I believed this was safest course of action as we were already in the valley between the mountains. I told the Pilot Monitoring there was no way to complete the procedure during the approach and we agreed to go missed. Because of our flap issue we could not perform the full missed approach procedure; flaps were locked less than 1. Once established outbound to the hold I continued the QRH. The Leading Edge transit lead me to several other procedures. We were able to extend the Leading Edge devices; but trailing edge flaps were locked and asymmetrical. Left flap at 1/4 and right flap about 1. We both agreed in the asymmetry. We ran the final QRH checklist (trailing edge flap up) because the left and right flaps indicated less than 1; test the flight attendants; [advised ATC] and performed approach to landing with the Leading Edge devices extended and the trailing edge devices indicating less than 1 degree. The landing was in the touchdown zone and on centerline. We exited at Taxiway Delta and requested airport fire rescue examine the brakes and landing gear. The scene commander determined due to our brake temperature we could not park at the gate. We were escorted to a remote stand. Fans were placed around the main gear and once the brakes reached a safe temp passengers were deplaned via air stairs and bussed to the main terminal. We completed our post flight duties; contacted Maintenance; Dispatch and the Chief Pilot. A transmitter breaker popped was determined to have been the cause of the malfunction.Lastly our decision to land in ZZZ was influenced by several factors. Limited options in the area; ZZZ1; ZZZ2 or ZZZ3 and weather. While ZZZ has its challenges due to terrain and optical illusions I believe it was the best runway given our situation. My first choice would have been ZZZ2; but we were down to 7;000 lbs. of fuel and with the leading edge devices deployed; I feel we would have burned too much fuel en-route and would have painted ourselves into a corner in ZZZ2. ZZZ1 runway is to rough for the high Vref and ZZZ3 had weather in the area.",,,,"A Boeing 737 pilot reported a trailing edge flap malfunction which resulted in the flaps being locked out in a slightly asymmetrical position.",

The crossing of the Atlantic was normal; with the fuel burn and quantity tracked on the FMC.

The fuel configuration EICAS message was displayed and the two First Officers ran the appropriate checklist as I; (the Captain); was on my scheduled rest break. I returned to the cockpit and the First Officers informed me of the situation and what they had done with respect to the checklist. We discussed the fuel situation and we determined that we really didn't know our exact fuel quantity and location with the conflicting information from the totalizer and FMC generated fuel. A Satcom call to Dispatch and Maintenance was initiated and it was determined that the best course of action was to [advise ATC] for unknown fuel quantity and receive priority handling to expedite our landing in ZZZ1; as we were only about 90 miles from ZZZ1.

While I did notice it; it was not particularly concerning to me as I was aware the engine had work done recently and the packs had been off as the aircraft was in MX all night prior to us accepting it. Climbing out of ZZZ prior to flap retraction we received an inter phone call from the rear FA XX_11 XX_16 stating that there was a fire and the cabin had a burning smell that was worsening and there was a little smoke or haziness. My FO (First Officer) confirmed the FA (Flight Attendant) said there was a fire and I immediately let ATC know that we would need to return to ZZZ ASAP. I did not specifically declare an emergency; but I did exercise my emergency authority. We were immediately given vectors for a downwind for 26. We continued to clean up the aircraft and I transferred control and ATC to the FO and I called the cabin again. I questioned the FA further who then indicated that there was no fire; nothing was hot; but there was an extremely strong odor with a burning like smell. With the urgency slightly reduced; I elected to call MX (Maintenance) and ask if the work they did may have created the odor and if it should clear up. MX indicated the work accomplished should not have created the odor; but that if it cleared up; we would probably be okay as long as we confirmed there was no fire. I again called the cabin and was told the smell was dissipating slightly but was still quite strong. I elected to return to ZZZ. We were vectored for a visual/ILS to Rwy XY and landed uneventfully underweight and taxied to the gate. AARF (Airport Rescue Firefighting) followed us to the gate and met the aircraft. After all pax (passengers) deplaned; AARF went to the aft cabin and confirmed no fire or heat but they did smell the odor. No passengers showed any ill medical effects and all deplaned normally. Nice job by the entire crew!",,"While climbing after departing from Runway XXR at ZZZ; at about 1000 feet; the aft Flight Attendant called the flight deck and informed us that she thought something was on fire in the aft galley/lav area; that there was an odor and some smoke; and it was '...getting worse.' The Captain and I had noticed a slight odor as we set takeoff power; but we had already discussed that the #2 engine had been bore-scoped recently and had been in Maintenance all night before we accepted the aircraft; and the little odor we noticed didn't seem concerning. However; upon hearing that there seemed to be smoke and it was getting worse in the back we immediately began discussing the need to return to ZZZ and informed ATC. We were given vectors for a left downwind to land on Runway XY. The Captain transferred control of the aircraft and the radios to me as he called the aft Flight Attendant to get more information. It seemed from that conversation that there was doubt as to whether there was a fire after all; as nothing seemed hot; but there was still a strong burning odor. I informed ATC that we wanted a longer downwind vector as we troubleshot and I loaded the ILS approach to XY. The Captain then called Maintenance and asked if the work they had done on engine #2 would cause the odor; and they didn't think it would. After further discussion with the Flight Attendants the Captain elected to return to ZZZ. We received vectors to a visual approach to XY and landed uneventfully. Fire trucks met us at the runway and followed us to gate XX. Passengers deplaned and none seemed to show any illness. After passengers had left the aircraft; fire personnel and maintenance personnel came aboard to investigate. Post flight discussions indicated there did not seem to be any fire or heat damage but there was still a burning odor in the cabin.",,"B737 flight crew reported Flight Attendant notification of burning odor; smoke and possible fire in the passenger cabin shortly after takeoff.

My copilot and I have done this several times in the last 30 days while not together but both very experienced with the procedures and the airport. We followed the procedures to the letter and fully briefed the take-off. After being cleared for take-off and lining up with the runway I advanced the throttles to 40%. After they were established at 40%; I hit TOGA. Just as the aircraft started rolling it suddenly surged to the right and at the same time the co-pilot called out the #2 engine not accelerating. By then the #1 was at full 27K 103.1 N1. I was able to retard both engines and was able to keep the aircraft on the runway. We taxied back to the gate and called for Maintenance to come out and inspect the tires and write up the #2 engine slow to accelerate after 40% power setting. The inspection showed no damage or wear on the tires and no faults on EEC or any other systems.We talked with TECH in ZZZ and they said that this has occurred several times on the 737 and was usually the cause of having one engine that is new and the other engine having a lot of time on it. The older engine is 'looser' and may not accelerate like a new engine but when 2 older engines are matched up they accelerate at the same rate so you don't notice the acceleration rate. He said that was the case with our aircraft. Our #1 engine was just installed 2 months ago. Our #2 engine was the original engine installed NEW recently. The #1 engine has 253 cycles; the #2 engine has 12;588 cycles and is 10 years old compared to a brand new aircraft. I was told by the Technician that they just watched a video on this subject and in the video it recommends after the power is set to 40% to leave it there for 20 seconds prior to hitting TOGA. I told him that is not something we were told about or trained to do.I believe that as our aircraft are getting older and engines are getting changed with high cycles; we should be tracking this combination and have a procedure in effect such as the 20 seconds at 40% N1 prior to TOGA especially when high N1 is required such as 27K BUMP; to avoid what could have been a more serious outcome had this crew not acted so quickly and communicated so quickly regarding the #2 engine not accelerating after TOGA.",,,,"B737 Captain reported a rejected takeoff after #2 engine would not accelerate to match #1 engine.",

Uneventful pushback; engine start; taxi and takeoff from XXR at ZZZ. On initial climb-out; I smelled a very faint odor in the flight deck. It smelled sweet; and I didn't think much of it at the time because I've smelled plenty of strange odors before and just assumed it was something galley or lav-related. As we continued the climb; the smell became a little bit stronger. It smelled almost exactly like Play-Doh. I asked my (First Officer) if he could smell something and he said no. To see if I was just imagining things; I put on my oxygen mask with 100% oxygen flow selected; and breathed with it for approximately 5 minutes. I no longer smelled the odor. Upon removing my mask; I immediately smelled the odor again. A few minutes later; we reached our cruise altitude of FL350. We completed our cruise duties. I could still smell the odor; and within a few more minutes; my eyes began to feel slightly irritated. The (First Officer/PF) reported that he could smell a faint odor; but reported no physiological effects from its exposure. To get a third opinion; we called the cabin and asked if the Flight Attendants could set up a barrier and if our #1 could come up front to see if he smelled something strange. Upon entering the flight deck; our #1 immediately reported a strong 'sweet' smell and a feeling of 'heaviness' in the air that was not present anywhere in the cabin. After leaving the flight deck; he walked to the aft galley and back to the forward galley and confirmed that the smell was only present in the flight deck. By this time; the 'Play-Doh' odor was a bit stronger; the (First Officer) began coughing; and we agreed that we were experiencing a fume event. We both donned our oxygen masks with 100% flow selected. We [notified ATC] with Center and told them we would be diverting to ZZZ2; which was almost immediately due south of us and within 60 miles. They cleared us to ZZZ2 via direct and we began our descent. The (First Officer) flew the aircraft and took the radios while I ran the QRC for fumes in the flight deck; which directed me to the QRH (chapter) to continue the procedure. I was extremely task-saturated nearly the entire remainder of the flight because the (First Officer) did not have any free hands to do anything but fly the aircraft (he was descending with full speed brakes and coordinating with ATC); so I also programmed ZZZ2 into the box as our new destination; got the ATIS; set landing field elevation; and then built the approach for Runway X. I set the inbound course and frequency for both me (Captain PM) and the (First Officer PF). He handed me his iPad so I could pull up the approach plate for him. I did so; and also gave him a quick briefing on the pertinent items for the approach. I ran the Descent and Before Landing Checklists. While completing these tasks; I was also running QRH for fumes in the flight deck. Step [XX] of the QRH procedure (as well as common sense) directed us to not delay landing in an attempt to complete all of the checklist items; so we prioritized landing at ZZZ2 ASAP over completing the entire checklist. Our masks began to fog up; so we switched to Forced Flow 100% (they cleared up quickly). I called the Flight Attendants as instructed by the QRH procedure to notify them that cabin lighting would be extinguished; but that passengers would have reading lights available. Communication was challenging; as the masks allowed us to talk to only one person at a time (i.e.; if I wanted to talk to the FAs; I couldn't communicate with the (First Officer; PF) while doing so because the mask muffled my voice); which made proper CRM absolutely crucial so that nobody was left out of the loop. The irritation in my eyes was no longer an issue (it only happened when I had my mask off) but my First Officer reported chest pains and painful breathing; even with the mask on. I asked if he felt okay to land the aircraft; and he said he was; but I stayed alert and ready to assume control should he become incapacitated. As we would be landing 6;000 pounds overweight; I also ran the QRH procedure for an overweight landing. ZZZ2 approach vectored us for a visual approach and landing on Runway X; which was conducted without incident. The timespan from initiating the diversion at FL350 to touchdown at ZZZ2 was 20 minutes. My (First Officer) touched down smoothly in the touchdown zone and on centerline. We exited right and stopped the aircraft to ensure the situation was under control and that we were safe to taxi to the gate. After agreeing that we could taxi in without further incident; we notified ATC that it was safe to release the emergency vehicles; and taxied to the gate & deplaned the passengers. None of the passengers or Flight Attendants reported any adverse physiological effects from the fume event; although our #1 said that after landing; they could also smell the odor in the cabin as the aircraft depressurized and the fumes were sucked aft to the outflow valve. After contacting the company; Maintenance and Dispatch; we were sent to a hotel; and from there the (First Officer) and I immediately went to the ER; where we were treated for our respective symptoms we reported during the fume event. After 4 hours of observation; we were deemed to be medically OK and released from the ER.",,"While leveling off at 35000 from ZZZ to ZZZ1 the (Captain; PM) and I (First Officer) began smelling a very strong odor in the cockpit. After checking the air-conditioning and trying to figure out where the smell was coming from the (Captain) started getting irritated red eyes. Once this occurred we started the checklist for Smoke; Fire or Fumes. As the flying pilot I asked the (Captain) to start the checklist while I spoke with the #1 Flight Attendant to see if the smell was also in the cabin. The smell was contained only to the cockpit. Once I determined this I notified Company Dispatch of our problem. Dispatch responded with a diversion to either ZZZ2 or ZZZ. I elected to go to ZZZ being the closest airport at our 1:00 position. I then [notified] ATC and we both donned our oxygen masks for the duration of the flight. I then joined the (Captain) on the QRC; QRH procedures. With the QRH checklist complete we then started prepping for the Visual approach to runway X into ZZZ2. We printed the weather; discussed and set up the approach; and programmed the FMS for the approach. Being vectored for the descent and slowing for the approach I then called for the Overweight Landing checklist since we were going to land at 152;000 pounds. We set up for this by referencing the QRH; landing with flaps 30 selecting runway 08 as the longest runway for landing. The approach and landing was done with a slow descent rate and as flat as I could and within the touchdown zone of the runway. We then exited the runway at [taxiway] and entered [taxiway] pointing East. We stopped the aircraft to assess the situation and decided to call off the ARFF [Aircraft Rescue & Fire Fighting] equipment. We opened the cockpit windows and took our O2 masks off to continue taxiing to spot L for gate XX where we shut down. After shutting down we realized that during the QRH procedure for the Smoke; Fire or Fumes we isolated and shut down all lighting in the cabin; resulting in the flight attendants using flashlights to assist in deplaning the passengers which went very smooth. I then completed the aircraft logbook with an ODOR entry and an OVER Weight Landing entry. I called Dispatch and my Chief Pilot on call to inform them of the situation. My final call was to MedAir to see what they wanted myself and the (Captain) to do. We arranged a hotel for the crew and headed to the hospital to be assessed. I received a breathing treatment; steroid; and chest Xray; while the First Officer received eye drops. After being monitored for 4 hours in the ER we were released to return to our hotel for rest. We have no idea where the smell came from; while doing the checklist the smell continued after all the isolating we did.",,"B737-800 flight crew reported a fume event in the cockpit which resulted in a diversion.",

There was a line of weather to our east and south and we were IMC and started getting turbulence. It was enough that we had some power fluctuations. Within a minute I smelled the smell; hot; sour; musty odor. My eyes and throat felt dry and burned. Within a minute of that; we got a call from the cabin that they were smelling the fumes also. I told them I would call them back as soon as we addressed the issue. Because we were still in radar contact; I told First Officer (FO) to get the checklist up and I sent a message to Dispatch to let them know before we got to class II. My thought was they would turn us around or send us to ZZZ or ZZZ1; but they wanted us to continue. We ran the isolation checklist; but the smell was dissipating so we were never able to isolate it. All the while were in turbulence and deviating. Over the next 2 hours we had 10 or more fumes events where it was a burst of smell then dissipation. 4 of the events led to FO and I putting on our oxygen masks. Right before reentering ZZZ2 airspace; we got a message from Dispatch that they were considering sending us to ZZZ1. We felt that was the best and safest course of action; but then they said they wanted us to press on. Because we didn't feel incapacitated and there was no guidance to divert. We felt pressured to continue on to ZZZZ knowing that wasn't a decision made with safety as a priority. We continued to ZZZZ; our conscience bothering us; and had a couple more fumes events. The last being when we transferred the bleeds from the engines to the APU. Upon reaching ZZZZ; we contacted Medlink and relayed our symptoms. Symptoms of exposure were: headaches; burning eyes and throats; nausea; light headedness; and numbness in extremities. I was told by Medlink that my symptoms warranted medical attention and that mine weren't even the worst symptoms. Every person on my crew should call them. I was not comfortable with going to an emergency room in ZZZZ so I agreed to do subsequent phone evals with medlink and get back to anywhere in the US for evaluation. In the end; medlink released me; but recommended seeing my doctor at my earliest convenience. I was alarmed at the onset and severity of the symptoms. They did seem to ease fairly quickly after getting fresh air and more water; but never completely went away. Another concern outside of all of this was inflight leadership response. The conditions that two of them were suffering were far more severe than mine. But they were actually afraid to call medlink or get checked out because they spoke to two inflight supervisors. One of those two supervisors told our inflight: 'under no circumstance are you to contact medlink.' and 'you are only allowed to contact medlink if you are incapacitated.' In the end they contacted medlink after receiving guidance outside [company] inflight leadership that they should follow FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) guidance and 'take personal health seriously.' My biggest concerns are the reoccurring fumes events and the downplay by the company. Being pressured to continue the mission despite safety. Finally; feel of repercussions for taking one's own health into consideration.",,,,"A320 Captain reported an intermittent fume event resulting in physiological symptoms by entire crew.

I reviewed the MELs in OPS. Per 28-XX knew to look for a fueling slip and a form XXXXX; though I was not familiar with that form. Once at the aircraft during preflight we did receive both forms from different fuelers. Release was 14;612; fuel slip showed a total of 14;800 lbs. At the gate the #1 tank showed 7.40; the center 0.00; the #2 tank was blank; and the totalizer was blank. Spending some time attempting to understand the form XXXXX; I discerned it was our aircraft and date; and the stuck tank measured to an equivalent volume of 7400 lbs. So it looked we had a balanced load of empty center and 7400 lbs in each wing tank. I filled in 14.8 in the fuel block on the INIT REF page; as that block was blank.During pushback and engine start the ground crew reported a fuel leak from the #2 engine. I had him stay connected during the five minute warm up period. By the end of the 5 minutes the leak stopped. Taxi; takeoff; climb; and cruise were normal. ATC gave us 2 shortcuts; one direct ZZZZZ after ZZZZZ1; then later direct ZZZZZ2. Fuel check at ZZZZZ was right on. I subsequently did the MEL recommended fuel check using fuel used. That showed 2.7 used by each engine (5.4 total). Deducted from the starting fuel of 14.8 gave us 9.4. Just after that we passed abeam ZZZZZ3; where I recorded 9.2; compared to the MISC 14 prediction of 9.5.Shortly thereafter the #2 tank FWD pump LOW PRESSURE light began to flash. I pointed this out to the FO (First Officer) and commented something like 'well that's not right!' then 'well now why would that be happening?' Subsequently that light came on steady; followed by the AFT LOW PRESSURE light beginning to flash. I told the FO we had a big problem and that we needed to consider that the only fuel we might have available was the #1 tank fuel; as I pointed to the left quantity. We agreed; and at that point the #2 AFT LP light came on steady; both MC lights came on; and the #2 engine began rolling back.At this point it appeared we had a right engine failure. We ensured the FO had the aircraft; he clicked off the automation and managed the yaw and loss of thrust. I reached up and opened the fuel crossfeed. Our estimate was that N1 decreased to about 20-30 %. After a very mild audible and tactile vibration; the right engine began to recover; increasing N1 and N2 and returning to normal thrust and indications. The FO and I agreed on the diversion to ZZZ which was ahead at 11:30 clock code and by then about 100 miles ahead. I [spoke with] ATC and told them we were diverting to ZZZ. I had been to ZZZ before and knew the station had [company] maintenance. I asked for a series of right 360s to descend. ATC said they had traffic over there; asked if we could take a left vector heading to absorb the altitude loss and I said yes. The FO continued to manage energy while flying the aircraft. From there it was the normal ACARS MISC [message]; backing up the FO as he deftly flew the aircraft and got us down expeditiously; running regular checklists; completing non-routine landing consideration tasks; talking to the #1 FA (Flight Attendant); making PAs; etc. The FO flew a flawless visual approach and spectacular touchdown; backed up by the ILS; to RW XXL.After landing on RW 1XXL and clearing the Runway I asked the ARFF commander if he saw any fuel leaking from the right wing or engine and he said no. Proceeded to gate XX. On the gate the indicating fuel gauges showed 3.52 in the #1 tank; 0.00 in the center tank. No other fuel light had ever annunciated (e.g. 'LOW' or 'IMBAL'). Maintenance was on the jet bridge; boarded on our arrival and we began the conversation; relating the details of what we saw over time. We agreed with their plan to stick the right wing; look for fuel leaks; talk to [Maintenance Control]; and eventually refuel to a known quantity and stick again. The fueler reported the #2 wing tank was 'bone dry'. We discussedpossible causes of our symptoms: a fuel leak; bad fuel; fuel sticking inconsistencies. They began their work; saying eventually they would be doing an engine start and run to look for leaks; all of which would take some time.In speaking with dispatch to determine a rough fuel load that maintenance could use in their work; [I was asked] to speak to a maintenance manager who was there. The manager asked for a recap; what lights we had; what paperwork we had received in ZZZ1; what RPM the #2 had spooled down to; and asked if we could send him copies of the fuel slip and form XXXXX. I later had the FO do that. ZZZ maintenance continued to work with us. They reported there was no placard out on the refueling panel for the 28-XXa.I made periodic PAs to the passengers. The #1 FA indicated there were some passengers that wanted to deplane. I went up to the gate to retrieve an agent. We discussed the options and mutually decided to deplane everyone. Back on the aircraft calls with dispatch resulted in us learning the aircraft was taken OTS. 3 AML entries were made reporting the fuel tank LOW PRESSURE lights and subsequent rollback with empty #2 tank upon arrival at gate; the engine rollback; and the pulled CVR CB.We began to get texts from ZZZ1 Chief Pilots supporting us and offering assistance.",,"Flight X from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 departed the Gate [a few] minutes ahead of schedule after having spent the night at the airport. While familiarizing and setting up for the preflight I noticed two of the three MEL's on the release were for fueling which showed the right gauge blank from the flight deck and a discrepancy on the fueling panel quantity indicator (option 2). While walking around the plane there were three men consulting on the fueling as this required a non-normal fueling procedure. After walk around completion; fuelers came to the flight deck and handed two pieces of paper to the Captain: a form and a Jet Fuel Service Record showing 7;400 pounds of fuel on each side of the aircraft (14;800 total). Sufficient fuel complying with the release (14;612 lbs.) After pushing back; the ground crew noticed fuel dripping from the right engine. Starting both engines with a follow up wait period of five minutes the drip had disappeared and we continued on. It was a normal takeoff on a good VFR weather day and the light load allowed us to climb quickly to flight level 390. Approximately 40 minutes into the flight the forward Number Two Fuel Pump Low Pressure light illuminated which caught our attention perhaps a minute later the aft number two fuel pump came on also. There was a brief pause when the N1 on the number two engine began to roll back. The Captain (non-flying pilot) quickly selected the fuel cross feed to open and the engine continued to operate normally. There was a momentary slight yaw and audible change discernible to the passengers as well. I turned off the autopilot. After assessing we may now only have the fuel showing on the left side; getting on the ground as soon as possible became the priority. The Captain [requested priority handling] and chose ZZZ as our new destination. The Captain was quite busy running checklists; informing the Flight Attendants and making PA's; in addition to monitoring pilot tasks. With so much altitude to lose we got vectors from the air traffic controllers for the descent and then lined up visually for Runway XXL and used the ILS for guidance. After I made a normal landing; the ARFF standing by the runway then cleared the aircraft of showing any fuel visibly leaking at the Captain's request. We continued taxiing to the gate where maintenance met the aircraft and after completing our shutdown checklist; they joined us on the flight deck while the passengers deplaned. Their measurement of the number two fuel tank showed it completely empty and 3;520 pounds remaining in the number one. We then began relaying information to dispatch; chief pilots; and union aids.For whatever reason the right fuel tank was not correctly measured and the information we received was false. We thought we had sufficient fuel but because of the absent fuel indicator for the right side tank and the belief that the tank had been fueled and measured properly we were wrong.The easiest correction would be to have the MEL address and corrected earlier; after that I would recommend when there is a question of fuel load that both sides of the aircraft be measured using the stick method.",,"B737 flight crew was dispatched with several MELs regarding fuel system. During flight crew received several fuel warning lights and the right engine rolled back. Crew diverted; landed safely; and learned their right wing fuel tank was empty.",

I was the Pilot Flying and the First Officer was the Pilot Monitoring. Approximately 1:30 minutes into the flight; I detected a faint odor that initially I thought might be from the air system. I mentioned this to the First Officer and then noticed smoke coming from the trip counter on my control wheel. The First Officer saw it too and we immediately put on our oxygen masks and smoke goggles and followed the QRC procedure of establishing communications. We followed the QRC which led us to the QRH. We followed the checklist for smoke; fire; fumes; and I also turned the MAIN PANEL brightness rheostat to off. At that point; the smoke had dissipated and no more smoke was emanating from the trip ID counter.We were able to determine the source; and since the smoke was no longer present; we elected to remove our oxygen masks and smoke goggles to more easily communicate and coordinate our divert. Given our location; we determined which airport was our best place to divert to. We advised with Center and were cleared direct to the airport. We were approximately 150 miles from the airport at that point. We notified Dispatch of the situation; and the First Officer informed the flight attendants of the situation. We told them to secure the cabin and also informed the passengers of the situation and our diverting to ZZZ. The landing was uneventful and no additional smoke was ever noticed. We taxied to the gate and the passengers deplaned normally. One thing a lot of us are guilty of is tapping the trip counter if the backlight is not working.

After completing the smoke fire or fumes QRC; we then completed the smoke fires or fumes QRH. As a measure of precaution in the event the smoke returned or a fire would start; we diverted to ZZZ. It was approximately 160 miles almost directly off of our nose. Given our altitude; the good weather; and knowledge of emergency services available; it was the best course of action.

Upon taxi; I noticed an acrid/dirty socks/musty smell when I added power. As I backed off the power on taxi; the smell seemed to dissipate. On power up taking the Runway (XXL); the smell returned. I made the decision to continue the takeoff and said to the First Officer that if this doesn't dissipate and go away we should return and he agreed. Once airborne; it got even worse and became a significant fume event. We donned O2 masks and goggles; I [advised ATC] due to fumes in the cockpit and we returned to land on [Runway] XXL. The First Officer flew and landed. I talked to ATC and ran the Fumes/Odor/Smoke Checklist. We landed uneventfully 2;000 lbs overweight.  Holding short of the runway; I called back to the Purser and asked him if he smelled anything. He said he didn't but would check in the back. I told him what we had experienced and that we would be returning if it continued. According to the flight attendants after landing; the smell was significant in the back of the plane and they said their eyes were burning as well. Upon arriving back at the gate; we were met by ARFF personnel and [Company] Maintenance. Firefighters boarded the plane and noticed the fumes as well; which were still present. The mechanic said they had done a 'compressor wash' the previous night and that it was his opinion that oil may have been freed from the compressors and entered the cabin. I was handed a Smoke/Fumes/Odor Form to fill out; which I did and returned it to Station Operations. Although some of the flight attendants complained to me about headaches and eyes burning; they declined to be checked out and told Inflight Operations they were fine and good to continue. I called the [Duty Manager] and we completed the human factors checklist. My Chief Pilot called to check on us and we said that while we may change our fit-for-duty status; for now; we were OK to continue. After talking about this more with the First Officer; we decided we were no longer fit for duty and advised the [Duty Manager].",,"During pushback from Gate XX at ZZZ; #2 engine was started normally; then First Officer began start of the #1 engine. After #1 engine light off; ground personnel told the Captain that an access panel had opened on the #2 engine. Upon the completion of the #1 engine start cycle; the number #2 engine was shut down; and ground personnel re-closed the panel. The number #2 engine was re-started without incident. Upon initial taxi; the Captain and First Officer smelled a strong oily; dirty socks smell. We checked with the cabin crew and nothing was noticed outside the cockpit. Fumes seemed to subside some during taxi to Runway XXL. Upon taxiing into position near the runway; with 40-45% power settings; the fumes seemed to reappear. Captain discussed the fumes with me and we decided to takeoff; and if the fumes persisted; we would [advise ATC] and return to ZZZ.Almost immediately after takeoff; the fumes became very strong.

This was day two of a three day for me and due to reassignment my original FO (First Officer) was not on the trip on this day. This was mine and the FO's first leg together. Everything was normal with preflight. The aircraft was towed up to the gate by Ground Personnel about an hour before departure and preparation was normal. I was expecting RWY XXL for takeoff; but when we called for taxi we were assigned RWY XY. FO accomplished the Before Taxi checklist and as we were taxiing out the Before Takeoff checklist was accomplished. We believe we checked everything and did the checklist in accordance with company procedures. Takeoff and climbout were normal. I was the PF (Pilot Flying) and was hand flying the aircraft until the [situation]. Passing 10;000 feet. I chimed the flight attendants as we continued climbing. Passing through approximately 12;500 feet. the Cabin Altitude warning illuminated and the aural horn came on. We donned our oxygen masks and told Center controller we were leveling at 13;000 feet. I then instructed FO to tell Center we needed a descent to 10;000 feet. The only light either of us ever saw was the red Cab Alt light. The FO got the QRH out and started the checklist. We were cleared to descend to 8;000 feet and the light extinguished at some point passing below 10;000 feet. The cabin altitude showed approximately 10;800 feet at the highest. The passenger oxygen masks did not deploy. We returned to ZZZ and landed on RWY XY. Taxi in and shutdown was normal. After we landed we discussed the event and I asked the FO if the switches on the Engine Bleeds; Packs and Crossfeeds we're out of position. He stated he couldn't remember (nor could I); but he thought they were. We both felt certain they were correctly positioned; but the more we questioned ourselves we both admitted we were not 100% certain.My thoughts are that we were not complacent in our preparation nor in accomplishing the checklists; nor were we rushed or distracted; but it is possible that the switches were in the incorrect position on takeoff and got positioned correctly during the [situation] and we simply don't recall either one of us moving them. Neither of us noticed any pressure surges before; during or after. It's possible they occurred and due to the warning horn and mask usage we didn't notice. I should have done a better job of instructing the FO not to touch anything prior to following the steps in the QRH. Also; it took us a while to get the warning horn off; which combined with using the oxygen masks and communicating with ATC and the flight attendants was distracting. Also; since I was hand flying the aircraft when the [situation] occurred; I wish I had immediately gotten the autopilot on. I would have been able to observe and manage the situation in a better way. After landing I asked him if he checked the pressurization per the After Takeoff checklist and he said he's not sure. We certainly have checklists that; if followed correctly; would/should trap these errors. I felt totally comfortable right up to the instant the warning horn and light came on. We weren't rushed; I was well rested and alert. I always make sure that when challenged with 'AC and Bleeds' during the Before Takeoff checklist that I physically point to the Pack AND Engine Bleed switches; making sure they are correctly positioned before I respond 'Auto and Set'. It's possible that the switches were in the incorrect position and that I looked; but didn't notice. I thought I was always diligent in doing this; but as I write this; I wonder if I saw what I wanted to see rather than where the switches actually were. I honestly am not 100% sure.Maintenance checked the aircraft thoroughly; including a pressure check; and found no discrepancies. The aircraft logbook was signed off and we were scheduled to continue our sequence to ZZZ1. I discussed with the FO that we needed to have our minds totally on the current flight and offered to take him off the trip and assured him there would be no repercussions if he felt he would be distracted while continuing the flight. He assured me he was fine; as was I. I briefed the FO that we would NOT discuss this event at all during our flight to ZZZ1 and I asked him if he felt good and able to fly. He responded that he felt good. We both elected to continue on to ZZZ1. I have told you exactly what happened to the absolute best of my ability. I instructed the FO to put in his own words what we experienced and what he thinks happened.Going forward; my intent is to get the autopilot on sooner. Also; I felt like it could have been better run if I had transferred control to him and I had run the QRH; notified ATC; Dispatch; the Flight Attendants and such. It all got completed; just could have been smoother. I hadn't thought about silencing the Cabin Altitude Warning horn in a long time. Today was a reminder that on any given day. Going forward; I'm doubling my effort to verify checklist items; expect the unexpected and follow all checklists precisely; brush up on all systems and to more fluidly and smoothly transition into the situation. I can assure that this will not happen again.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B737-800 flight Crew reported a cabin pressurization malfunction during climb that resulted in a return to the departure airport and uneventful landing.",

Checking the engine indications showed nothing abnormal nor out of limits. The Number 2 engine had slightly higher vibrations at 2.1. The Captain disconnected the autopilot and auto-throttles; and began reducing thrust. With the power back the vibrations did subside. During the descent the Captain added power on the #1 engine and we soon heard and felt what seemed similar to a compressor stall. The Captain returned the engine to idle and used #2 engine for power as necessary; however we still did not have any abnormal engine indications. At that time we notified ATC and requested direct to the field as well as Runway XXR. On the way into landing we reviewed the QRH for engine high vibration; engine severe damage; and engine limit or surge or stall. We also planned for a possible single engine flaps 15 landing just in case the Number 1 engine failed on final. All engine indications were still normal up until about a three to four mile final when the Number 1 engine vibrations began to increase with the throttle at or near idle. The highest vibration that I saw was about 3.4.Once we landed; Tower told us that they saw possible flames from the Number 1 engine and fire and rescue told us of smoke from the engine. We ran the Engine fire QRH to shut down and secure the engine; we did not fire the bottle however since we did not have any internal fire indications and the fire department was in the process of spraying the engine. We coordinated with the Fire Department and Maintenance on the field and when they agreed everything looked safe we were towed to the gate for deplaning.",,"During arrival on ZZZZZ X RNAV Arrival we had an unusual engine malfunction on the Number 1 engine requiring non-standard Crew Member coordination and communication between Pilots and Flight Attendants; significantly increasing the task loading.

The other Relief Pilot and myself were on break for roughly an hour when we were asked to return to the cockpit due to a divert and medical emergency. Once we returned to the flight deck we coordinated with ATC; Dispatch and Maintenance regarding the divert and sick passenger. It was determined by all involved that continuing to ZZZ was not an option and ZZZ1 was the best choice in order to protect the operation and take care of the ill passenger. In addition; during the divert phase of the flight (last 1:30); we were in contact with Dispatch and Maintenance to determine whether or not we should dump fuel or land overweight. After a thorough discussion; we decided to dump 100;000 lbs. of fuel. During the dump process; one of the fuel nozzles failed. It caused the dump rate to be cut in half. This added another layer of complexity to the divert. We called Maintenance again to see if they could offer any help; which they could not. At this point; the entire cockpit crew came together to brainstorm and make sure all SOP was complied with. The Medical Guide and Diversion Planning Guide were pulled out in order to ensure we had not forgotten anything. The flight attendants and passengers were briefed; and; most of all; we thoroughly briefed the approach; landing; and ground phase in order to ensure the medical personnel ability to reach the passenger in the rear of the aircraft at the gate in a timely fashion.Once we arrived in ZZZ1 and parked at the gate we were all quite exhausted due to the medical divert and high workload. At that point a representative from Flight Operations entered the flight deck and asked if we would continue on to ZZZ. We all discussed our current state and came to the conclusion we did not feel safe continuing. The Flight Operations Rep. then said they needed one First Officer as they had found a Captain and one First Officer. At that point we had been on duty for approximately 8 hours and with a proposed scheduled departure of XA:30 for ZZZ would have added an additional 9 hours of duty; resulting in a roughly 18 hour duty day; if the flight would in fact depart at XA:30. At that point I did not feel fit and comfortable continuing to ZZZ and believe it would not have been safe; especially taking into account our current state of mind and additional duty time.Ultimately; it was my desire to continue and not delay the passengers any further; however; with safety in mind it simply was not prudent to continue.",,,,"B777 First Officer reported that a passenger illness resulted in a diversion.",

The Captain had requested I investigate. I inspected the wing and immediately noticed a stream of fluid emanating from the top of the left wing from the fuel cap. I returned to the flight deck. I'd already briefed the crew on this same situation having experienced it the month before on the same aircraft. We read through the QRH procedure but agreed it would not be prudent to shut down an engine and that it would make the situation worse. We reviewed the FOM diversion guide. We agreed it was prudent to divert as we had no way of knowing how severe the leak was and we certainly didn't want to be over an ocean with fuel leaking. We would be landing overweight (even after dumping fuel); and began looking for airports with longer; dry runways. We felt ZZZZ was our best option and advised ATC. After some time; ATC advised us that ZZZZ would not take us for a fuel leak despite our [priority] status and they felt it was unusual for us to be passing other airports. We explained that we had assessed those airports and that there was either insufficient runway lengths or wet runways and that we were overweight. We landed in ZZZZ1 safely (originally we elected not to go there because of the wet runway but then dispatch indicated it was dry). Passengers seemed to be in good spirits until we got to baggage claim and then they were irritated by the slowness of getting their luggage. There was also some difficulty (because of staffing limitations); getting passengers to the busses despite there being numerous announcements over the airport PA system.",,"At about XA00Z during cruise; one of the flight attendants told us that a passenger was seeing fluid coming off the left wing. The flight attendant could also see the fluid from the left wing; with none coming from the right wing. We asked that the Relief Pilot also check. He too reported fluid coming from the area of the fuel cap; and coming off the left wing (a photo and video of this were later sent to Maintenance). The Relief Pilot rejoined us in the cockpit; and we briefly discussed that the same aircraft had the exact same type of fluid flow off the left wing from the exact same area about a month earlier - coincidentally; the Relief Pilot had been on that flight; too.The fuel leak non-normal checklist (QRH 120.6) describes a visual sighting of fuel coming from the engine strut or engine; which was not what we had. Nonetheless; as we believed that the fluid coming off the wing indicated a minor fuel leak; we consulted the checklist to see whether 1) There was any information which we might find useful; and 2) To be prepared in case the leak worsened into something described in the checklist.From the time we were informed about the fluid on the wing until well into descent to our diversion airport; we watched for indications of possible fuel leak in the fuel leak checklist (QRH 120.6); as well as comparing fuel onboard to both the flight plan and ACARS. At no time did we see anything from any source which indicated a fuel leak other than the visual sighting on the wing.We consulted with Dispatch and Maintenance via SATCOM; and everyone agreed that it was likely a fuel leak; and that diversion was the prudent course of action. This decision was made around XA30Z.We knew that we would be landing overweight even after dumping all remaining fuel from the center tanks; and we all agreed that an airport which had both long and dry runways would be best.Given that we knew we would be diverting; dumping fuel; and landing overweight; as per our training we requested priority hanlding with ATC.The items in the Diversion Planning Guide were covered partly during our call with Dispatch and Maintenance Control; and partly on our own afterwards. Rough performance calculations indicated we would need nearly 7;000 feet of runway at our estimated 345;000 lb. landing weight with wet conditions as per flight manual; which seemed to be the case in the closer airports. If we used the brakes hard to stop shorter; we thought we might melt the fuse plugs before we could get to a gate as per flight manual. ZZZZ was the best fit of dry and long runways. We therefore told ATC that we would divert to ZZZZ; and requested clearance to dump fuel. We received initial vectors towards ZZZZ; and were told to wait to begin our fuel dump.While waiting to begin the fuel dump; I spoke with the Purser and gave her the procedural information. I then told the passengers the nature of our problem; and that we were diverting to ZZZZ.Clearance to dump fuel came perhaps 5-10 minutes later. Before we began; the Relief Pilot made an announcement to the passengers that we would be dumping fuel so they would not be startled to see more fluid coming from the wings. We dumped all fuel remaining in the center tanks as per the fuel jettison checklist. This totaled about 14;500 lbs dumped at cruise altitude over the sea.After some time and perhaps a frequency change; ATC told us ZZZZ would not accept us. ATC's verbiage was something like 'ZZZZ won't accept a fuel leak diversion aircraft' or 'ZZZZ won't accept you as a diversion aircraft with a fuel leak.' Aware of the note on the ZZZZ 10-XX page about use of ZZZZ for emergencies and that there were other adequate airports to use; we didn't contest this. ZZZZ was the best choice; but not the only choice for a safe outcome.While considering our next best option with Dispatch; numerous other airports were discussed with consideration for our overweight condition as per FOM. This was complicated by a temporary paper jam in the ACARS printer; and intermittent WiFi reception in the cockpit; both of which slowed the gathering of information necessary for us to make a good decision.At some point in this stage; ATC asked us about our priority status; saying that usually in their experience priority aircraft have to land ASAP. Realizing the error in the prior priority declaration; we made the decision to downgrade our status.We made the decision to land at ZZZZ1 due to the length of the runway; coupled with a new report calling the surface Dry (upon arrival; we found the surface to be wet; though with no standing water. Braking was good). Passengers were briefed about the change in diversion airport during the descent phase. We landed on Runway XXL at 340;000 lbs; and after arrival at the hard stand area; made appropriate logbook entries for maintenance in re the overweight landing and speed when brakes were applied. The entire crew stayed with the passengers until they were all off the aircraft and into the terminal area with appropriate assistance.",,"B767 flight crew reported a fuel leak that resulted in a diversion.",

We both have a metallic taste in our mouths and headaches. I called the Captain from the back galley and alerted the Captain to the smell. He recommends that we clean the area with club soda and Sanicom wipes. Flight Attendant B wiped down the floors and the air vents are helping move the smell. The Captain suggested asking the passengers in the back if they can smell it; but they are all currently sleeping. We have requested a cleaning crew to meet the aircraft. We also asked for Maintenance and an Inflight Supervisor and decided to keep [Catering] from opening the aft door until the smell was investigated.The plane was met by three Inflight supervisors as well by Aircraft Tech; Maintenance and Captain XX who is a friend of mine and is well versed in the emergency medical I had on another [aircraft] with a toxic smell. Maintenance mopped the area well and both doors were opened for circulation. I believe the determination was made that a now discontinued form disinfecting solution was over used by contract cleaners causing a build up of excess product in the entry door vents and surrounding areas causing the toxic smell.Flight Attendant B was pulled from the flight and was replaced due to still feeling nauseous and light headed. The smell did not return on the next two flights.",,"After deicing in ZZZ and a lengthy tarmac delay (over 45 minutes from pushback to takeoff); Flight Attendant B began to feel extremely light headed; nauseous; and had a headache. Right after takeoff; Flight Attendant B had to leave the jumpseat to go to the lav due to nausea and had some ginger ale to prevent passing out. After about 15 minutes; Flight Attendant B began to feel slightly better but realized she had no appetite and had a metallic taste in her mouth. Upon further assessment; she realized that a strong chemical smell was the cause of nausea and the smell was not dissipating. Flight Attendant B began service with Flight Attendant C in aft galley. After service; Flight Attendant B and Flight Attendant C were both sitting on the aft jumpseat and the strong odor continued. Flight Attendant A came to the aft galley and Flight Attendant B mentioned the strong odor and that it was causing headache; nausea; and lack of appetite. Flight Attendant A confirmed the smell and Flight Attendant C did also. Flight Attendant A wanted to call the flight deck to report it to the pilots. The Captain advised cleaning the entire aft galley; which seemed unrealistic. Flight Attendant B felt that it was likely a cleaning solution and possibly on the floor of the galley. Flight Attendant B covered the aft galley floor in seltzer water and mopped up the seltzer with C folds; with Flight Attendant C's assistance. Flight Attendant B spent the rest of the flight in the cabin and front galley where the smell was not present. Flight Attendant B requested that an Inflight Supervisor be present to witness the odor; and mentioned that she would ask [Catering] to thoroughly mop the floors with water in ZZZ1. Flight Attendant B used peppermint oil to help with nausea and light headedness during final descent and used a nuisance mask to prevent inhaling further fumes when on final descent. The fumes were noticeably stronger near the jumpseat and in the corner by the aft entry door. Upon arrival in ZZZ1; Engineering; Inflight Supervisors; and Maintenance were present. After Flight Attendant B identified the smell/taste as acetone and explained the morning in ZZZ; Engineering discovered that the issue was a disinfectant used on the lavatories and floors; which; when mixed with glycol from deicing; caused a strong odor of acetone and this was a known issue so the cleaner was being phased out.",,"B737-700 flight attendants reported chemical odor permeating the aft galley causing the B Flight Attendant to experience physiological issues and removal from subsequent flights.",

It is being written from the perspective of the First Officer (FO).Background: A flight had cancelled in ZZZ earlier in the day resulting in this flight being booked to capacity. Weather in the ZZZ terminal area was rain; temperatures below 10C and low IFR conditions. Light and moderate rain echoes (WSI) prevailed to the east of ZZZ; but it was determined that it would not impact our route of flight. The Dispatcher for this flight planned a northerly route at FL290 to avoid a SIGMET for severe mountain wave over southern State X as well as moderate turbulence forecasted at the higher altitudes. Departure from ZZZ was routine. We had a total of X SOB [Souls on Board] and our takeoff weight was approximately 195;000lbs. We were cleared to join our filed route and were advised to expect moderate turbulence while climbing through 25;000 to our filed altitude of 29;000. Upon coordination from ATC; we climbed to FL310 to avoid reported areas of turbulence. While initially there was occasional moderate; turbulence conditions and flight visibility improved as we approached ZZZ2. Approaching ZZZ3 at FL310 in mostly smooth visual conditions; the aircraft abruptly shuttered. The pitch changed notably 2 degrees; the FO screens momentarily blinked and the aircraft climbed/descended slightly. Both the Captain and I were suddenly on high alert. Moments later the following ECAM appeared: 'ELEC GEN 2 FAULT.' The Captain and I proceeded with the non-normal methodology. The Captain was PF for this leg and he resumed aircraft control with the AP on. I conducted the ECAM actions and follow up. The attempt to reset GEN 2 was unsuccessful; noting that the singular time the GEN was reset the aircraft shuttered again. (I theorize that this was due to power interruptions to the ELACS). Conducting the Follow up procedure; the APU was started. The APU began to spool up normally and it was anticipated that the APU would power the buses serving as a second source of power. As the APU came up to speed; I heard multiple relays begin to 'Click' from behind our seats. Shortly thereafter; the APU faulted and conducted an Auto-Shutdown. In discussion of this with the Captain; we decided not to attempt another APU start. Looking at the ELEC page on the lower ECAM; we noted that all buses were powered; main galley was shed; and GEN1 had picked up the entire electrical load. There were no other ECAMs for the remainder of the flight. At this point the aircraft was being powered by a single electrical source which was an emergency condition. This was confirmed by the QRH procedure which stated to landing at the nearest suitable airport. The Captain and I began to assess our diversion options. To gain situational awareness relative to our geographic location and the weather system behind us; I attempted to pull up weather using the iPad. As I did this; I noticed my iPad was no longer connected to [the] flight deck. It was assumed that the aircraft's wireless network at this point was load-shed. To assist us with this decision making further; I then sent the following text message to our Dispatcher via ACARS (this is not verbatim; but it is something close to what I believe I sent). 'EMERGENCY. ENG 2 GEN FAULT; APU FAILED TO START; WE ARE SINGLE GEN OPS. NEED TO DIVERT.' At this point it was expected that the Dispatcher would assist us with choosing the best suitable airport for landing given the condition of the aircraft. The following ACARS exchange took place:Dispatch: 'COPY MSG... YOU LOST BOTH APU AND ENG GEN... WHERE YOU WANT TO DIVERT... DISP XYZ.'Pilots (not verbatim): We stated that we were thinking of either ZZZ4 or ZZZ5.Dispatch: 'NEITHER ZZZ4 OR ZZZ5 IS IN C70 FOR AIRBUS BUT DOESN'T MATTER WITH EMERGENCY... YOU WANT ME TO CALL ZZZ5.'After this message both the Captain and I began to assess which airport would be more suitable. The Captain referenced the diversion guide and noted that both KZZZ5 and KZZZ4 were listed as adequate. We considered ZZZ6; but it was significantly south and in an area of the turbulence and mountain wave.Since we were overweight (now 187;000 lbs) we conducted a landing assessment. Given the Field Elevation at ZZZ4; along with its runway length; our landing assessment at Flaps 3 came to 9091 feet. This distance exceeded the runway length available. KZZZ5; which was still 80 miles ahead; offered us a [longer] runway with two ILS approaches. The weather was also good VFR (230/12 10sm FEW085 9/m09); the field elevation was not as high; and there were two ILS approaches available for landing. In consideration of the potential for a GEN 1 loss resulting in an EMER ELEC Configuration; combined with weather and terrain issues; the Captain and I concluded that a diversion to KZZZ5 was the safest course of action. We informed the Dispatcher that we had chosen KZZZ5. The following ACARS message was received:Dispatch: 'ZZZ5 ISN'T QUALIFIED TO WORK AIRBUS HE SAID...ZZZ4 IS MAINLINE; DO YOU WANT TO GO THERE...'I responded that we were too heavy to land in ZZZ4 and that the landing distance was too excessive. We had chosen KZZZ5.Dispatch: 'COPY NEW DEST IS ZZZ5... OPS FREQ IS XXX.XXX'The Captain and I discussed this again; and we reaffirmed amongst ourselves that KZZZ5 is the safest choice; despite there being little services there upon landing. We concluded that we would deal with this issue later; that the most important issue at hand is to land the aircraft safely with; hopefully; at least 1 generator still working. At this point the Captain made a PA announcement and also began coordinating with the Flight Attendants. I took aircraft control (briefly) and informed ATC that we needed to divert to KZZZ5 due to an electrical issue. When [notifying ATC]; I provided SOB and FOB (Fuel on Board). ATC was already aware that we were working an issue and knew that we were actively deciding the most suitable airport. We entered the new destination into the MCDU and set up for the approach. We conducted the Non-Normal landing considerations to make sure nothing was forgotten. Approaching KZZZ5; both the Captain and I felt we needed more time to prepare for the overweight landing. We elected to hold on a waypoint of the approach to complete the checklist. This also enabled us to burn additional weight. We felt that this was a safe decision; and worst case the runway was in sight and we would be able to land visually if needed. As we entered the hold at ZZZZZ (XXR) we began the overweight landing checklist. Given the time compression; I struggled to find the correct page in the QRH. Eventually I found it and began to go through each item. There were two challenges associated with this checklist (in addition to trying to find it).1) Slowing the aircraft below green dot to VLS in order to lower FLAPS 1 without a FLAP overspeed. This was accomplished without issue.2) When deciding whether to land FLAPS 3 or FLAPS Full we referenced the table on page X. Given the field elevation I used the 4;000 feet column. With the temperature of 9'C I determined that to land Flaps Full we would need to be below 181;000. We were at 182;000; but given the fuel burn while holding it was decided that we would be below 181;000 lbs once accepting the approach; therefore we could safely land using Flaps Full. In the holding pattern; we made one final PA to the passengers that they would be seeing ARFF equipment and to not be alarmed. The ensuing landing was uneventful. We used the max available runway and the brake temps remained below 400 degrees.Upon clearing the runway; I called the Station Ops from the frequency the Dispatcher provided us. The manager answered and told us we were to park at [gate] and that they had never worked an Airbus before.Upon parking at [gate]; the jetway pulled up to the L1 door.The manager knocked on the cockpit window to ask us how to open the L1 door. All doors were disarmed and we told him to lift up the handle; which he did. Now the question to be asked was about deplaning the aircraft. The Captain was largely involved with this process. The station manager was told by someone in [hub] that the aircraft would need to be deplaned using the rear exit due to CG issues; otherwise a tail-stand would need to be found. Both the Captain and I had never heard of this before. In addition; the airport would need to bring air-stairs to the aircraft and the passengers would have to walk outside on the ramp area and up the Jet-Bridge stairs in order to access the terminal. After much back and forth between [hub] and ZZZ5; it was determined that the passengers could exit out the L1 door; but should be accomplished very slowly. Some passengers elected to remain on board; while most deplaned. The KZZZ5 station team is to be commended. The remaining crew had come to airport to assist; as most were on their day off. In total; we had approximately 6 station personal to service the entire aircraft. Once the passengers deplaned; the Captain recognized that there was little offerings inside the terminal for food and refreshment. The Captain decided to order 40 Pizzas along with 20 2L soft drinks in order to keep the passengers calm and respectful of the assistance we were trying to provide. This decision proved to be highly effective; as the passengers were very appreciative of our efforts over the ensuing 5 hours. After coordination with the Scheduling; Dispatch and Maintenance; it was determined that [company] would send a rescue A321 from ZZZ7 to KZZZ5 to pick up our passengers and bring them the rest of the way to ZZZ1. After review of our duty limits; we were limited in our duty day (even with extension) so the inbound crew would take these passengers to ZZZ1. During these coordinating efforts; the Captain made an entry into the maintenance logbook. The entry reflected the failed generator; APU fault and overweight landing. Maintenance Control informed us that despite landing overweight; there would be no inspection required since the Airbus AMM did not require one. The write-up and load report were delivered to Maintenance Control via email. After further review the next day; there was concern that a separate write up with the overweight landing was needed. Maintenance Control reiterated that this was not needed since no inspection was required. After review of the FOM; the Captain made a separate entry and the Maintenance technicians flown in from ZZZ7 signed off the write up. In order to provide a gate for this A321; the station needed to push our aircraft to the hardstand. This involved a high amount of coordination because the station did not have a tug nor tow-bar to do this job. A former [company] employee who used to be in ZZZ7 now worked for [other company] in KZZZ5 and assisted us with this effort. He was able to find the appropriate tug and tow-bar for the job. A second issue came up. The A321 departing ZZZ7 would incur a 3-hour catering delay. In order to reduce this turn-around time on the passengers; the Dispatcher asked us to remove all the galley carts from the aircraft in order to service the inbound A321. We did so and placed the galley carts in the jet-bridge. The ramp crew did not know how to open the cargo doors. After consultation with Maintenance we resolved this issue as well and the ramp crew was able to unload all the baggage from the forward and aft cargo holds (beginning with the aft first). While all this was taking place; the pizza and drinks arrived for the passengers. It should be noted that at this point all the FAs [Flight Attendants] were eager to get to the hotel. They were visibly angry from their exchanges with crew scheduling and did nothing during this entire process to assist with the passengers on the aircraft nor in the terminal. Upon receiving their hotel information fr",,,,"A321 flight crew reported that the Number 2 Generator faulted in flight; and APU would not start; requiring a diversion and overweight landing.",

We donned our oxygen masks and began working through our smoke procedures. We had no smoke; no confirmed fire; and no abnormal indications in the cockpit. The Captain advised ATC and informed them we were diverting to ZZZ. The initial call went unanswered. Upon the second call; we were issued a clearance direct to ZZZ and began descending. I flew the airplane while the Captain continued to run our checklists. We determined the safest course of action was an expedited landing despite being overweight. As we progressed through the checklist; the smell began to dissipate. We landed without incident smoothly and taxied to the gate where we were met by fire and rescue crews.

Engine 2 Sensor and Engine 2 FADEC B. ECAM procedures were completed. Shortly thereafter another ECAM; Auto Thrust came on. While dealing with that; Engine 2 Start Valve Open came on for a few seconds; then went away. Within a few seconds after that; Engine Surge came on and engine 2 began surging. I immediately requested descent to FL240 and the First Officer pulled the #2 thrust lever to idle; at which time the engine stabilized; so we elected to keep it running. At this point; we decided to divert to ZZZ; which was about 60nm behind us. The First Officer continued flying and operated the radios and set up for the approach while I dealt with remaining QRH procedures; contacting Dispatch; the flight attendants; and making the PA for passengers to notify them that we were diverting to Nashville due to a maintenance issue. We [requested priority handling] and ATC cleared us direct to ZZZ. We elected to land on Runway XX; since winds were calm and it was the longest runway. We were very close to the airport. In order to lose altitude we were given some extended vectors. ARFF (Airport Rescue Firefighting) was standing by for us. We executed the RNAV/GPS approach to Runway XX; leaving engine 2 at idle and using manual thrust; as the autothrust was also inoperative. Because I had more time in the aircraft than my First Officer; I elected to do the landing; so at approximately 15;000 ft. I took over pilot flying duties. The landing was overweight but uneventful. We taxied clear of the runway and stopped to give ARFF a chance to evaluate the status of the aircraft. They gave us the all clear and followed us to the gate. It's difficult to adequately describe the somewhat chaotic nature of events on the flight deck due to the intermittent and continuous ECAM indications that came and went during the entire event. The Start Valve Open indication repeated intermittently at least twice; possibly three times; and there were some other intermittent indications which came and went; all to do with Engine 2. Once the engine stabilized at idle; the ECAM abnormals cleared; except for the original two - Engine 2 Sensor and Engine 2 FADEC B. Once at the gate; and after ensuring that the passengers were taken care of; I talked to the local mechanic and wrote up the event in the logbook; to include the overweight landing as well as giving him the error messages that printed out after shutdown. Most likely; a failure of FADEC B which appears to have caused multiple engine malfunctions.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"A321 flight crew reported an engine malfunction during cruise that resulted in a diversion and overweight landing.",

A very slight pressure bump was felt which coincided with the R BLEED TRIP OFF light illuminating on the Pneumatics System overhead panel. After identifying the Pilot Flying; the QRH was referenced for the appropriate checklist procedure. The BLEED TRIP OFF light failed to reset; which resulted in the R A/C Pack being placed in the 'OFF' position in compliance with QRH procedure.Shortly after the completion of the QRH procedure; the crew discussed and agreed that a descent from FL380 to a lower altitude and lower PSID would probably be a wise course of action. A lower altitude was requested and ATC began to coordinate and approve the aircraft descent. Upon passing approximately FL360; the cabin altitude was noted to be rising and the red CABIN ALTITUDE Warning light illuminated; accompanied by the warning horn. The QRC and QRH were referenced for the appropriate procedures.

The flight was proceeding without incident and all fuel indications were normal until the Captain was preparing to shut off the center fuel pumps. He noticed a fuel imbalance of 300-400 lbs. The CA corrected the fuel imbalance. It then became imbalanced again in a relatively short amount of time. It was at this time that we both observed a drastic drop in fuel on the left main tank. It showed a loss of approximately 500 lbs. in about 3 minutes. I know that fuel fluctuations can be normal when the center fuel pumps are shut off but this seemed excessive. The rate of fuel loss from the left tank seemed to slow after that initial drop but we were closely monitoring the amounts and observed an imbalance of approx. 900 lbs. Once the fuel amount on the left tank stabilized we started discussing the possible cause of the fluctuations. And it was at that time that we started watching the total fuel burns more intently. Prior to the all of this happening; the recorded fuel burn at ZZZ2 on the flight plan was 400 lbs. over scheduled burn which seemed slightly unusual for the conditions but as we watched the FMC planned burn at ZZZ3 we realized that we were going to be over the scheduled burn by almost 2;000 lbs.; which was excessive. According to the scheduled flight plan fuel burn; the fuel amount at ZZZ3 should have been 15.4. We crossed ZZZ3 with 13.5 indicated. We believed that we could have a fuel leak due to the amount of fuel loss in such a short amount of time and the fact that the total amount of fuel onboard was much lower than planned.The CA went into the QRH and went to the Fuel Leak - Engine checklist. We agreed that we met the criteria for the checklist and continued. The CA proceeded with the checklist; talked to the FAs (Flight Attendants); and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance. We asked the FAs to check for evidence of a fuel leak. The FA said they saw moisture on the left wing; but not the right wing; and the FA did not see mist coming from the wing. The CA's wife was also onboard the plane. She is a professional pilot so we asked her to check for evidence of a fuel leak. She reiterated what the FA said about moisture on the wing; but no mist spotted. While the CA was doing that; I was pulling the weather for ZZZ4 and ZZZ.

We then noticed the left wing tank had an amber caution imbalance and was about 1;500 lbs. lighter than the right wing tank. I asked the PIC if we were in balance before departure; and he reminded me that we both had verified the quantity and balance before taking the runway. We then passed our first fix on the fuel log and noticed we were 1;000 lbs. down. The PIC then continued to trim the aircraft to engage the autopilot; while asking me to retrieve the Fuel Imbalance Checklist from the QRH; which lead us to the Fuel Leak Engine checklist. Once I retrieved the checklist the PIC transferred control and radios of the aircraft to me for the duration of the flight. We then weighed our options. Because we were by now 2;000 lbs. light in our left tank and knowing there are not many airports between ZZZ and ZZZ1; we decided to return to ZZZ. As the Captain proceeded on with the checklist; he asked me to [advise ATC] and to start heading back to ZZZ. I asked Center for direct for the field; center then handed us off to approach. On initial check in I asked approach for straight in Runway XX; knowing that it was the longest runway with a headwind. Approach asked if we wanted the visual; I then asked for the RNAV Z Runway XX. Approach cleared us direct to TACOH to cross TACOH at 10;000 ft. and cleared for the approach. Somewhere in the process approach asked if we wanted ARFF standing by and I replied; 'affirmative'. Approach then asked for number of souls on board and fuel remaining. Meanwhile the Captain busy completing checklists; notifying flight attendants; and notifying company; informed me that the flight attendants had smelled fuel on departure. The flight attendants smelling of fuel helped us confirm that our decision to return to ZZZ was correct . Then on about a 5-10 mile left base for Runway XX; the Captain came to the part of the Fuel Leak Engine checklist that required us to shut down the left engine. We weighed our options. There was 5;000 lbs. of fuel in the left tank; the fuel leak had subsided at the low thrust setting; engine indications were normal; there was a lot of traffic in the terminal area (a missed approach wasn't out of the question); we were chose to landing; and we didn't want to do a single engine missed at a high altitude/high terrain airport. We decided to to leave the engine running and complete the decent and before landing checklist. We landed without event and I stopped the aircraft and transferred control of the aircraft to the Captain. The Captain told the passengers to remain seated as we retracted the spoilers and set flaps to 40. ARFF then advised us that there were no leaks or fire and followed us off the runway to the gate; where they boarded and checked on the status of the passengers. All of the passengers were fine. The entire flight from takeoff until touchdown lasted approximately 15 minutes. The Captain did an amazing job of delegating responsibilities among the crew while still keeping everyone in the loop. Although there was a lot to do in a short amount of time; I never once felt rushed or in the 'red'. I attribute this to the Captain setting a great tone on day one of our trip that promoted great team work and communication.",,"On departure; passing 10;000 ft. we noticed a rapidly growing fuel imbalance between wing tanks. Left was 2;000 pounds less than right tank. Sight right roll tendency was noticed. I passed control and comms to the First Officer. I contacted Tower to query about fuel venting from left wing. None noted. [Advised ATC] and initially leveled off. First Officer flew a return to ZZZ. I ran the fuel leak checklist; emergency landing checklist; briefed the Flight Attendants and made PA. notified Dispatch via ACARS. I had #1 (Flight Attendant) confirm no visible fuel leak on left engine/pylon and left wing areas. First Officer flew a flawless approach and landing to Runway XX. We stopped straight ahead for ARFF inspection; then taxied to gate with ARFF chase.I elected to not shut down the left engine and land based on the following- No visible indications of a fuel leak. All engine indications were normal throughout. Landing was to be conducted in mountainous terrain with high traffic volume.

We determined that the best course of action was to return to the airport. We requested to level off at 9;000 feet and advised ATC. I began the smoke and fumes checklist as we entered a downwind vector to return to the field. We descended and executed the Runway XX ILS approach to an overweight landing of approximately 163;000 pounds. Upon exiting the runway; we requested an inspection by crash fire rescue personnel who met the aircraft. They reported a normal heat signature on the aircraft. We returned to the terminal and parked at gate. We were met by station Maintenance Personnel to discuss the incident; and then wrote up the details for the smoke/fumes incident and the overweight landing in the AML.We loaded our passengers onto a new aircraft and departed approximately 2 hours late.I suspect that this event may have been the result of a recent engine change. Maintenance told us upon our return that there had been an engine change. Possibly some residual fluid that entered the bleed air system upon takeoff and climb at high power.I do not have any suggestions for avoiding a recurrence of this event I believe the situation was handled appropriately by both the cabin and flight deck crew when one considers the very real possibility of a potential fire.",,,,"B737 Captain reported that smoke and fumes in the cabin resulted in an air return.",

The aircraft started noticeably shaking. The First Officer was flying and pulled the number one throttle to idle; the shaking lessened but did not stop. I immediately started the APU. The flight attendants were ringing the cockpit; I had cabin now on my headset and could hear they were concerned the aircraft was shaking really bad in the back and that passengers were saying sparks and flames were coming from under the wing. I had already [advised ATC] and told them we had engine trouble. Ask them to stand by for further. I grabbed the QRC and started the ENGINE FIRE or ENGINE SERVER DAMAGE or SEPARATION check list. We did not have fire indications in the cockpit but with the shaking and reports of sparks and flames from under the wing I thought that the appropriate plan of action. I performed the checklist and First Officer flew the aircraft. We completed the first (few) steps on the QRC with in 2 minutes of the realization we had a major engine problem. After we had engine shut down I told ATC we needed lower that we had lost an engine and would get back with flight vitals. ATC told us we had ZZZ behind us we had a military base to our left and ZZZ1 straight ahead and asked out intentions. I quickly talk over with First Officer ZZZ was behind and about a thirty-minute spiral down to an unfamiliar military base; so decision was made for take straight in to ZZZ1. I completed the check list in QRH while First Officer flew and do normal radio. I coordinated with the flight attendants we had shut down the morning #1 engine we had [advised ATC] and that we were going to make a single engine landing in ZZZ1. I told them I would get back with the as far as the time to ETA and that we were not expecting an evacuation; I also told them I would make an announcement to the passengers shortly. I told ATC that we wanted the longest runway and to have safety vehicles to meet the aircraft at the runway about mid field. First Officer and I briefed the approach for Runway XX ZZZ1. We used a 1;000 fpm descent to allow descent rate with minimal power to maintain safe airspeed get the aircraft to 12;000 ft. about 20 miles from ZZZ1. I told First Officer I hope he didn't mind but I felt more comfortable landing the aircraft (this had no bearing on his ability his performance was stellar). At 12;000 ft. I took the aircraft and asked First Officer to verify all items on the check list were complete. We held off on the Grd Prox switch for the flaps 15 landing so we could keep out speed above 250 kts. Having First Officer verify items was to make sure this item and all others were complete; First Officer accomplished a non standard landing. I gave the cabin a 10 minute prep and a quick announcement for passengers before descending below 10;000 ft. Flew down wind slowing and descending to 3;000 ft. turned base at 12 miles. Completed a successful stable single engine landing on Runway XX ZZZ1. Stopped the aircraft at mid field. Told passengers remain seated three times. Safety equipment came to aircraft inspected entire aircraft were given the ok to taxi to gate. Safety equipment followed us to the gate without incident. In closing Cabin crew maintained professional calm attitude. More than effectively conveyed situation in the cabin to the flight deck so the best information was available.

The Flight Attendant called us the second time reporting passengers looking out the window saw sparking and fire below the left wing. We quickly realized we were losing the left engine. We [advised ATC] and we headed to ZZZ. We complied with the appropriate check list and descended to a lower altitude. We requested the longest runway in ZZZ (Runway XX) and the assistance from [crash fire rescue] on the ground. I flew the airplane while the Captain finished the check list and prepared the cabin crew for the emergency landing and he did the PA to the passengers.

I used the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) and completed the checklist for the malfunction; isolating the pump. Shortly after that; we noticed that the quantity indication was decreasing; and stabilized at 20%. We recognized that as a leak in the pump itself; or possibly the lines to the pump; and considered that the primary cause for the failure. As such; and given that the electric pump was operational and no other system degradation was noticed; we continued to ZZZ. We monitored the hydraulic page; and noticed that the quantity was further decreasing; at a rate of 1% every ten to fifteen minutes. We calculated that we'd land with 8% to 10%.During this time (from occurrence to top of descent); we coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The decision to continue was supported. At the top of descent (almost immediately after starting down); the Master Caution illuminated again; this time with a 'LOW PRESSURE' light above the B system Engine Driven Hydraulic Pump. I delegated flying and radios to the FO; who was the Pilot Flying for the leg; and ran the same checklist as before. With the B system pump isolated; we noticed the quantity decreasing (initially 106%; now 80%.) It stabilized at 80% and didn't further decrease. After running the checklist; I told the FO that with two system failures that weren't at all typical; I would like to proceed direct to ZZZ. He agreed; and I did so with Approach.We were approximately 75 miles from the airport. I sent a message to Dispatch and Maintenance Control explaining the new problem. I called the Purser and told her what was happening; and discussed the [briefing] items. I told her that no cabin preparation was necessary and that we'd land in about 25 minutes. We concluded; and I made a PA to the passengers. I told them that we had a hydraulic problem; that the airplane was flying normally; but that as a cautionary measure we would be followed in by fire trucks after landing all the way to the gate; and that it was not something with which to be concerned.We got vectored for a right base and landed with no incident. On rollout; the A system quantity went to zero; and then restabilized at 12%. Nosewheel steering was normal; and braking action was normal. I elected to taxi clear of the runway and proceed to the gate with no further assistance. We ran the Parking Checklist and debriefed the flight; then per Gate Message; ran the Terminating Checklist.

We were to depart at XB:16 the next morning. The ambient temp at XA:15 when we arrived at the jet was -10 with a wind chill of -30.  During engine start the oil clog ECAM messages displayed momentary for both engines due to the extreme cold. Both FO (First Officer) and myself discussed the warm up of the engines. FO was the pilot flying the leg and the flight was non-eventful during cruise. There was a front approaching ZZZ and Dispatch was keeping us informed of the weather. I spoke to Dispatch inflight and we agreed to add ZZZ2 as an alternate due to the line of weather that was to the east of the field.  When we checked in with ATC we were told to expect holding on the [name] arrival at ZZZZZ at FL200. FO entered the hold and at this point the weather was between us and the field below our altitude. Since the descent would be around weather I called the flight attendants and had them prepare the cabin for landing and to remain seated for the remainder of the flight. After one turn in holding; at FL200; ATC told us we were going to be vectored to an arrival to the east of the field due to weather. As we started our descent; on a vectored heading; I started to smell a 'musty sock' odor.  I looked at FO and asked if he was smelling the same thing. He said yes and we both put on our O2 masks. I made a quick call to the back to check on the flight attendants. The number one said he didn't smell anything and the FAs (flight attendants) in the back said that she did smell 'some sort of odor'. I remember thinking to myself that I was starting to feel the same hypoxic symptoms I felt during Air Force altitude training. FO and myself assessed each other and we were both feeling much better with O2. At this point we were in a descent; on vectors; going to the east of the field for weather. I decided to notify ATC due to the fumes and not knowing if the cockpit would remain clear of haze because the onset of the fumes was so rapid. ATC quickly gave us vectors to runway XX in ZZZ. We stayed on O2 for the reminder of the flight. After landing and clearing the runway; I turned the aircraft bleeds and packs off. EMT and fire department personal checked passengers as they exited the aircraft. Cause: As I stated above the engines were cold soaked on startup. This odor has been linked to oil and oil seals in the engine and packs. Maybe the first real thrust reduction exposed a gap in one of the oil seals. Suggestions: This type of odor is associated with tricresylphosphate (TCP). When we landed Maintenance told us that the only way to test the aircraft was to start the engine on the ground and then smell for the TCP 'musty sock' odor. I find it unbelievable in a fume event like this that there isn't a procedure to take a swab of the cockpit or cabin to detect the presence of TCP; compound that would easily be found. There has to be residue left behind in the cockpit. When I went home I shower and scrubbed myself clean.",,"On descent into ZZZ in IMC; Captain and I detected an unusual odor. We donned our masks. I was pilot flying so I maintained control of the aircraft while the Captain spoke with the FAs (flight attendants) and ran the QRH. [We notified ATC] and we proceeded direct to ZZZ while deviating around some strong radar returns. Landed without event and taxied with priority to the gate. Aircraft was removed from service. My only suggestion would be immediate removal from duty. The Chief Pilot laid out our options; but left it up to us to decide if we were fit to continue duty. It took some time to self evaluate after the adrenaline wore off; and I'm glad we went to get evaluated by a medical professional.",,"A320 flight crew reported a fume event during initial approach resulted in the crew donning oxygen masks and continuing to destination.",

This incident could have turned out very differently. I understand returning aircraft to service in a timely manner when it is a minor issue; but when we are talking about a total loss of electrical power; that is a very serious occurrence. Certain things should not be rushed and there should be no shortcuts.  It is mine boggling to me that this occurred twice in a 24 hour span in the same aircraft. That is completely unacceptable and this issue and needs to be looked into.Descending on the arrival into ZZZ;we were given descend and maintain 2;000 ft. Around 4;000 ft. I heard a 'clicking noise' which sounded like an electrical component or contactor opening or closing behind the Captain's seat and an ECAM message shortly after confirming we had a GEN2 failure. The noise is what I hear when a generator comes on line after starting an engine or the APU. Shortly after we heard another 'clicking noise' and generator 1 failed as well. The aircraft then entered the ELEC EMERGENCY CONFIGURATION. We were left with only the RAT (Ram Air Turbine) and the electrical and hydraulic components associated. This occurred on a downwind to Runway ZZL in visual conditions. Due to the nature of the emergency and the phase of flight we [Requested Priority Handling] and asked for an immediate visual approach to Runway XXL. We weren't sure if there was an electrical fire or what the nature of the emergency was. We agreed to land ASAP as per the ECAM. We confirmed the gear was down and didn't have enough time to fully run through the ECAM or COM procedures. After landing safely the aircraft was met by fire trucks and we were eventually towed to the gate in ZZZ safely. It was brought to our attention after arriving that this was the second occurrence in 24 hours with this aircraft. Maintenance simply wanted to do a 'reset' and an engine run up and see if they could duplicate the issue and release the aircraft back into service just as they did yesterday. Our Contract Maintenance Mechanic in ZZZ didn't feel comfortable with that and politely refused saying this aircraft needs a more thorough check of the electrical system. Something is causing this issue with the electrical system and it needs to be addressed immediately. There is no reason this aircraft should be returned to service until we know what is causing the issue and it is addressed appropriately.On a side note we were also given the wrong logbook in ZZZ1 before the flight. Fortunately we caught the mistake and were issued the correct logbook. I think there needs to be a little more sense of urgency within our Maintenance department. We got an apology from the Mechanic; but if we had not caught the mistake we'd have been in a bad situation after an emergency and we don't even have the correct log book. Once in ZZZ; The Maintenance Controller only seemed concerned about getting an aircraft returned to service as soon as possible to prevent delays and cancellations. This was obviously the same behavior the previous night in ZZZ1. This isn't a simple deferral or something that should just be brushed under the rug. If you are losing both engine generators within seconds of each other; that isn't a fluke. With both engines running normal; this shouldn't happen in an aircraft with a properly working electrical system.  This is a serious matter and needs to be addressed immediately.","Reporter stated that the same type of incident occurred the previous evening on the same aircraft.","Maintenance should try to put more effort into finding the problem of why something isn't working rather than trying to just get the logbook signed off ops checks OK. or could not duplicate. We have been seeing this more and more.I need to do a better job briefing even when it's clear and a million visual approaches.We were [flying] A319 flying from ZZZ1 to ZZZ on at approximately. It was clear skies with no wind. We were on downwind for Runway XXL at ZZZ in a descent from 4000 ft. to 2000 ft. We both heard a noise in the cockpit. The first officer asked if I heard something. The noise I heard sounded like electrical relays switching behind us. An ECAM message appeared on lower ECAM for GEN 2 FAIL. When I saw this I ordered gear down. My thoughts had already started towards trying to get the airplane on the ground sooner rather than later. We were in the traffic pattern at our destination airport when this all started to happen. When the gear came down we immediately heard the CRC; we lost the Autopilot; FD's; and Autothrust all at the same time. I also saw USE MAN PITCH TRIM in Amber above my attitude indicator. The First Officer lost his 3 screens and I immediately knew that we were in the emergency electrical configuration and this was going to be a Direct LAW landing. We turned towards the airport inside the final approach fix. We [Requested Priority Handling] requested fire rescue equipment to be standing by.We landed on Runway XXL at ZZZ. We rolled out to the end of the runway and managed to clear the runway. We stopped the aircraft safely; set the parking brake and shut down both engines. We had Fire rescue check the aircraft over. We never started the APU or requested external power to be plugged in. My thought was something is wrong with the AC buses knowing that we had just lost two generators within a few seconds.We made sure all FA's (Flight Attendants) and passengers on board were okay and we kept them in the loop and up to date with the information that we had.We requested a tug to tow us to the gate. Ground operation came out with a tug hooked up our aircraft and towed us to Gate. The Fire Chief continued to monitor us visually as we were being towed.At the gate we had external air hooked up and no External power. The plane was left at the gate with flaps out and RAT (Ram Air Turbine) extended. We made a logbook entry in the aircraft logbook. I called Maintenance control but couldn't reach anyone on [the] A319 line so I called the A320 line and finally got Maintenance to answer. I informed him we lost GEN 1 & 2 inflight and RAT is out. He told me that this was the second time this has happened in the last 24 hours.Contract Maintenance showed up to the aircraft. Maintenance Control talked with the Mechanic and I via phone and wanted the mechanic to reset the RAT and have us do an engine run and see if we could get the airplane moving again. The contract Mechanic told us that Company needs to bring in a team of Mechanics to dive in and see why this aircraft is tripping off generators.At the start of our day; ZZZ1 Maintenance brought us the wrong aircraft logbook. Thank goodness we caught this at the gate in ZZZ1 so we then had to call the Mechanics back out to bring us the proper aircraft logbook. I'm glad we had the right logbook at the end of this flight.",,"Flight Crew flying A319 aircraft encountered electrical failure in descent.",

The Main Gear showed UP indication but the Nose Gear indicated in transit (white crosshatch indication). There was loud buffeting noise that also indicated probably Nose Gear in transit. We advised ATC of the malfunction and requested holding at 10000 ft. They advised that traffic was light and that they would provide vectors instead of holding. We followed FOM CRM technique for emergency situations. The First Officer was Pilot Flying and handled routine ATC communications. I as Captain handled checklists and all other communication with Flight Attendants; passengers; Dispatch and Maintenance. I made a PA announcement to explain the noise and contacted the Purser via interphone to advise her we were working checklists and would most likely be returning. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance using SATCOM. I described the malfunction and requested if Maintenance had any other information about this type of gear malfunction. I advised them per GEAR DISAGREE checklist the landing gear would be extended using the alternate gear extension. The GEAR DISAGREE checklist was completed. The First Officer and I discussed landing performance and discussed fuel dumping versus overweight landing. We determined that our landing weight would be 447;000 lbs. which would be 2000 lbs. overweight. Landing performance data was evaluated and was well within safe parameters.Dispatch was advised of return and overweight landing. I advised ATC since this was a non-normal situation and our workload was increased. All checklists were completed and passengers; Flight Attendants were notified of return to [departure airport].

We got an autofail light on the pressurization panel. I immediately grabbed the QRH to reference the emergency procedure. We started running the checklist. We had an autofail light with an uncontrollable cabin altitude. We then asked ATC for a lower altitude; but were not allowed to descend. The QRH directed us to go to alternate on the pressurization panel. We then selected alternate (ALTN). At this point the autofail light was still illuminated and the cabin altitude was uncontrollable. The QRH then says to go to manual mode and to manually open and close the valve as needed to control the cabin altitude. The Captain then began controlling the cabin manually with the toggle selector. He pressed the manual switch slightly and I started to see the differential pressure climb into the caution range and moving toward the max differential limit. I then heard the Captain say oxygen masks on and 100 percent. After I donned the mask I looked up and saw that we had exceeded max differential pressure. We established communication and checked that the seatbelt sign was on. The Captain kept running the checklist and I notified ATC that we needed a lower altitude immediately. ATC allowed us to descend to 36000 feet initially and then 32000 feet. I initiated an emergency descent and I continued to ask for lower altitudes and after consulting with the Captain I [notified ATC] for a pressurization problem. I asked for 10;000 feet and asked to divert. Meanwhile the Captain worked through the autofail checklist and had moved to the rapid depressurization and emergency descent checklist. The Captain was also communicating to the flight attendants; passengers and was attempting to contact Dispatch. After getting things stabilized the Captain and I came back together as a team to communicate what had been completed by each of us; so that we both could gain situational awareness of what had transpired. He told me that he had completed the checklist down to the deferred items and I told him that I had the airplane set up to land and was ready to brief him for the landing whenever he was caught up. We then briefed and continued uneventfully. After landing the mechanic verified that the primary and alternate pressurization controller were not working and he was suspicious that the manual mode wasn't working correctly. We did not receive the final diagnosis before leaving the aircraft. The Captain and I debriefed the flight and determined the following. Communication with the masks on made it challenging; but we were able to work through it. We did a good job of dividing duties to make sure that the airplane was being flown; checklists were being completed and situational awareness remained high. I would attribute this to our CRM training program.",,"Enroute at 40000 feet the First Officer called our attention to an MCP overhead annunciation; caused by a fault in the pressurization system. The PRESS panel had AUTO FAIL and ALTN lights illuminated. The First Officer reached for the QRH in order for us to take an initial look at the accompanying procedure. Initially the First Officer began to go through the steps since he sat closer to the panel. At this point both of us noticed that the cabin was descending and that the DIFF PRESS was increasing into the yellow arc on the indicator. At this point I took over the QRH procedure and he resumed as pilot flying. He also assumed ATC communication responsibilities. I then asked him to request a lower altitude for us to perhaps make it easier to deal with the problem. Center responded with a negative due to traffic. Each step on the QRH procedure was followed in sequence. But at this point in the narrative I will only mention the steps that bear significance; or provide a turning point in the sequence of events. At this point the QRH procedure directed me to (step 5) select the mode to ALTN; which was done. The cabin continued as before with a slow descent and increasing cabin pressure. The AUTO FAIL light remained on and at this point the mode selector was placed in MAN (step 7). I then made one single short/snap toggle for the outflow valve (OV) to open to stop the descent and bring the diff press down. The result was a large (approx) 1000+fpm rise in cabin alt. It was even physiological as I felt the result of the rapid pressure change. Also the quick snap of the toggle switch appeared to produce a disproportionate movement of the outflow valve indicator needle. After a couple seconds I reversed the step and made a quick (single) snap toggle back to close. The cabin stabilized but now the diff pressure was in the red and climbing. Fearing an imminent and uncontrollable triggering of the positive pressure relief valve I called out for the First Officer  to don our masks and I went over to the Cabin depressurization QRC. We [notified] ATC after we began our descent via the QRC procedures; which included selecting PASS OXYGEN on. The First Officer was flying during the descent and did a good job of flying the profile and complying with ATC off vectors as well as adjusting speed for the turbulence and maintaining safe distance from some convective activity we needed to clear. While I struggled to get my glasses back on and readjusted enough to resume the checklist. It also took a few seconds to reestablish communications as his ACP (Audio Control Panel) got bumped out of the intercom position during the flurry of activity. At this point we [notified] ATC. Several attempts were made via service interphone by the cabin crew to contact the cockpit which were answered briefly with a 'stand by' but were apparently not understood by them due to mask noise. Center initially cleared us to 32000 feet; but then re-cleared us to 18000 feet then finally to 10000 feet; where we remained the rest of the flight. We were over water so terrain was no factor. Upon reaching 10000 feet we came off our o2 masks and resumed normal cockpit communications. I next contacted the cabin for an assessment. They stated that the passengers were all fine and that no injuries had been sustained. After a brief explanation of what happened I told them I'd get back to them in a minute. I then took a minute to consolidate; and make sure all the checklists had been complete and that ATC was fully caught up as well. I then attempted to contact Dispatch over ARINC but due to distance and altitude; was unable to establish a VHF connection. I proceeded to ACARS Dispatch to establish communications with them. We then discussed as a crew that we didn't have the fuel to continue to our destination at 10;000 feet. After coordinating with ATC and Dispatch we diverted. At this point the workload was reduce significantly and I made a PA to the passengers; explaining that our pressurization had malfunctioned and that the masks had been deployed as a precaution; and that we would not be able to proceed to our destination. Approach and landing were uneventful. After seeing the passengers off; the First Officer and I debriefed the event and flight as a whole. We both agreed that communication while on the masks made CRM more challenging; but we were able to overcome this to the extent necessary to make sure that we both were completing our tasks and maintaining overall situational awareness. The mechanic who met the aircraft and did the initial tests on the system made the statement that ' both controllers were failed.' He also mentioned that when he moved the outflow valve manually it was moving in a strange way. We noticed this as well.",,"A Flight Crew reported loss of pressurization in the cockpit requiring an emergency descent and diversion to the nearest suitable airport.",

'Vomiting; and in-and-out of consciousness; and nauseous'. Male; 60 years-old was also suffering from COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder). There were three Doctors onboard tending to the ill Passenger. As the Pilot Flying; I handed control over to the FO (First Officer); and contacted STAT-MD. The FAs headset was not working very well; compounding the issue; so I became the go between. STAT-MD suggested we 'lay the Passenger down; head resting; feet elevated 10 inches'. STAT-MD made the recommendation to leave the ill Passenger on the floor; in this condition; for 30 to 45 minutes. If there is no change to his condition; to call STAT-MD back. I relayed this to the FAs and disconnected with STAT-MD.The three Doctors on board disagreed with STAT-MDs recommendation; and said we need to land; 'NOW'. I was 100 percent going to take the advise of Doctors ONBOARD over STAT-MD. I reconvened as the Pilot Flying; and we came to the decision to divert to ZZZ. Since the EMK (Emergency Medical Kit) would be used; and the landing would be overweight (145;300 pounds); Maintenance would need to be involved. A diversion plan was made by Dispatch; and we [advised ATC]. Center cleared us directly to ZZZZZ on the Arrival; landing west. Things got busy; real busy. I began an; expeditious; descent to get on the VNAV PATH. Only about 80 miles from ZZZ when we began our turn for the arrival. My FO picked up ATIS and ran the numbers for XXL and XXR; including a look at the Brake Cooling module. We then briefed the arrival and approach. As we got lower we kept getting turned in on the arrival; which I was okay with. I admit; I was a bit in the Yellow for awhile. We were below 10;000 ft. when we finally got around to running the Descent; Approach; and Diversion Checklists. I extended the gear early; to help lighten our weight by as much as I could. The approach was made to Runway XXR. The; soft; landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway; and right into the ramp. The FO contacted Ramp; Ops; and Maintenance. Once in the gate; I left the seat belt sign on and made a PA to the Passengers to remain seated. The EMTs quickly deplaned the ill Passenger and left. As soon as the boarding door was open; the Parking Checklist complete; and I turned on my phone; I was barraged; to say the least. I called Dispatch and spoke with him; the Chief Pilot on Call; Ground Ops; and Maintenance. I didn't even have time to debrief with my Crew. Once I was able to talk to the FAs it was made aware to me that an IV had been administered to the ill Passenger. It ran out as we touched down. The FAs said the ill Passenger's condition IMMEDIATELY deteriorated again. Further justifying our decision to divert. I feel I made the best decision I could; considering the circumstance and utilized all necessary resources to reach the desired outcome. A job well done by my Cabin Crew; and my FO. I also think a stellar job was made by Ops and Maintenance to get the aircraft on its way again.",,,,"B738 Captain reported a medical diversion.",

This caused severe damage to the fuselage. Main causes were probable fatigue; poor weather; and deferred items. The crew's duty day was extended the full two hours allowed due to passenger compliance complications in ZZZ. The weather was worse than forecast or originally reported; the worst winds reported by Tower were approximately 260 deg at 25G35. The deferred auto speedbrakes were very probably a contributing factor to the initial bounce; which led to two other porpoising bounces. Our scheduled duty day comprised of two; 5-hour flights with a 2-hour refueling stop in between. A schedule like this provides for very little sleeping breaks for the augmented crew; much less than a single long flight would allow. The use of duty time extensions on top of an already-long day should also be explored. Training involving a more thorough understanding of the effects of speedbrakes; particularly for heavy category aircraft; could be very beneficial going forward.",,"While on approach in ZZZZ; Tower reported turbulence over the threshold.

Moderate turbulence was experienced on the approach. On touchdown the aircraft bounced and then bounced 3 times. At some point during the landing the aircraft fuselage was damaged. Deferred items- the auto speed brake was inoperative and the auto speed brake may have prevented the aircraft bouncing. Possible fatigue- the crew accepted a two hour extension in ZZZ due to passenger compliance. Weather- the turbulence over the runway in ZZZZ was not reported well and no intensity was given. Suggestions- A training session on use of the auto speed brakes and what to do when they are inoperative.

I recognized the scent as something from the chemicals that maintenances uses on the aircraft on the ground; like deicing in the engines or a chemical burning off. The captain stated they were also smelling it in the cockpit. The Captain stated we'd be going back to ZZZ at that point. No passengers complained until arriving in ZZZ (they were both crew members dead heading; which noticed and recognized the original scent).

I also started to feel very light headed and dizzy; almost lethargic. My headache remained and increased in intensity. We landed and de-planed. Management met the flight; but we continued to be on the aircraft. As I did my final walk through; I notice the odor/fumes were extremely strong between the 3 LR and 4 LR doors. They burned my throat and caused me to feel like I wanted to cough. Catering came to 4L and opened the door; which dissipated the odor/fumes in the cabin. The crew de-plane the aircraft. We were escorted to Operations where we calls the on call nurse; Who referred us to an emergency room. Myself and the three other flight attendants receive treatment in the emergency room and were released. Suggestions: There should be a set protocol for an immediate lab test for specific blood gasses; levels of certain chemicals and toxins. We were stalled and left in the fumes with deplaning and calling unnecessary nurses when we were seeking treatment no matter what. The Airbus needs an investigation on these fume/odor events.

Right after that Flight Attendant called to report a strong burning smell. I asked if anything was in the ovens and she replied no and she would investigate and call back. Shortly she called and said the smell could not be identified but appeared to be coming from the air ducts. First Officer and I discussed it briefly and I advised her we would return for landing with 10 minutes remaining in flight and a normal landing. First Officer continued as flying pilot with autopilot engaged and managed programming the FMC for a return to ZZZ. I ran the smoke fire fumes checklist; used ACARS for sending the divert message; and continued communication with ATC including [requesting priority handling]. While running the checklist we decided the oxygen masks were not needed. Then we completed the normal checklists. I made a brief PA to the passengers. We noticed the off-schedule descent light and noted we were returning to the departure field taking no further action on that light with consideration of being on approach. I asked if First Officer was good to continue as flying pilot through the landing and he completed a nice landing.",,"On climbout from ZZZ; I noticed a burning smell. I confirmed with Captain that he smelled something awry; a bit less acrid that an electrical fire smell; but definitely not a smell associated with normal operations. We both wondered aloud if perhaps the flight attendants had left something in the oven and perhaps it was burning. I was the Pilot Flying and about this time the Purser called and Captain spoke with her. I could overhear that Captain was discussing the smell with the Purser. He passed along that both the flight attendants and the passengers could smell something burning as well. Captain asked the purser to have a look at the galley areas and the lavatories. The Purser reported back that they could not find anything burning but nevertheless still smelled the odor. During this time Captain and I discussed returning to ZZZ. To me; the odor was gone/dissipated; but we agreed that an air return was the best option. I remained the Pilot Flying while Captain did the initial coordination with ATC. He described the situation to ATC and I started on vectors to return to ZZZ for the ILS. ATC then queried whether we were going to [request priority handling] and Captain replied in the affirmative. I continued with autopilot as we were vectored for the approach. I reprogrammed the FMC for the approach while Captain ran the smoke/fume/fire checklist. At this point we had considered donning masks/regulators but I believed that in the time-compressed environment on short approach that masks/regulators presented a threat of distraction and loss of situational awareness. We mitigated the threat by leaving the masks stowed with no visible indication of smoke/fire and with the fumes dissipated on the flight deck. The ACARS diversion option populated at I programmed the ARR and queried Captain if he had notified Dispatch yet. Sure enough; he already had. I then verified the NAVAIDS/COURSE/MINS and quickly briefed the approach as we were on dogleg to final. Captain made a PA announcement to the passengers to assuage any concerns about firetrucks/first responders on rollout. We then discussed clearing the runway after landing which we both agreed was the best course of action. We got the 'off scheduled descent' light but pressed without performing that checklist due to our position on the approach; noting that we were returning to our departure field. We were pushed to the single frequency approach frequency and I remained the pilot flying and configured around 10-12 DME. Captain ran the landing checklist and we landed uneventfully; transferred aircraft control with idle reverse and cleared the runway. After getting the 'all safe' from the Fire Chief; we returned to the gate; ran the appropriate checklists and Captain made another PA announcement to the passengers.

Accomplished QRC/QRH; which required an emergency descent and deployment of cabin O2 masks. Notified ATC and got clearance to 14;000 feet.

Checked with F/As (Flight Attendants) to make sure there were no injuries and to advise that they and passengers could remove O2 masks. The rest of flight was uneventful. Preventative Measures: F/O suggested that we start down as soon as we saw the cabin climbing after the thumps. I wanted to see if cabin would stabilize since the rate was slow. If we started down earlier; we may have avoided the emergency descent/masks since the cabin stabilized at FL230.",,"We noticed a thumping/ vibrating sound.

As we were descending through about FL390 the cabin reached 10;000 feet we donned our oxygen masks; went through the QRH; complied with the required items and continued our descent to 14;000 feet. ATC was great; they asked questions; but not in a rushed 'need an answer right this second' kind of way and were very helpful in our divert plan. Our cabin stabilized passing through 23;000 feet and was trending down to a lower cabin altitude. When things settled down; we talked to the flight attendants to make sure they were ok and get a status check on the passengers. The flight attendants were fantastic; definitely handled this event professionally and took care of passengers above and beyond. The passengers that we interacted with hardly seemed rattled or concerned at all; I feel this was likely due to how the cabin crew handled the situation. We landed in [diversion airport]; taxied to the gate; shut the aircraft down and went on about our day.",,"B737-700 flight crew reported an uneventful emergency descent & diversion due to a loss of pressurization during cruise.",

I confirmed that no smoke was actually present just the smell.  We adjusted the packs cooler and the smell dissipated. We had [Runway] XXL in the FMS and received a change to [Runway] XXC.

Because there was very little wind. Some of this smoke entered the aircraft before we finished starting the #1 engine. Other than a slightly odd smell; it seemed to disperse quickly.  I verbalized this to the pushback crew and the First Officer. Additionally; I mentioned to the FO (First Officer) that I would call the flight attendants and make an announcement over the PA. Before taxiing; the F/A's (Flight Attendants) called to report the smell and that there was some possibility of smoke or haze in the cabin. I communicated through the F/O that we would check back with them after we taxied a ways to see if it was improving or getting worse. I also made a PA to the passengers.  At this time I believed the problem was that we had ingested exhaust fumes from the engine start. After taxiing for about four minutes; I checked back with the F/A's and the front two could neither see nor smell anything. The back two said they could still smell something; but not see anything.  They also stated that it was not getting better; but neither was it getting worse. I discussed the situation with the F/O and he felt there was no reason not to go; but thought one more check with the F/A's might help.  Since we just talked to them and they were alright with going; I elected to continue. We executed a normal takeoff and upon approaching the cleanup altitude; the odd smell returned and I stated that this was something that required us to return to ZZZ. Simultaneously; the F/A's also reported the smoke and fumes had returned. I am not sure of the precise order of events; but we donned our oxygen masks; notified ATC; and requested a return to the airport.With our masks on; the F/O and I struggled to communicate with each other and ATC. Basically the design shoots so much oxygen into the mask that it overpowers the microphone inside it.  We both operated the mask correctly and spent some effort and time verifying the settings; but nothing worked. For this reason; I elected to make a relatively quick return to the airfield. In all my experience (43 years); I have never had a problem like this with a mask.  I asked Maintenance Control if I should write both masks up and said no because they frequently get complaints like this. We flew a box pattern and made an uneventful landing with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) truck giving us a good check out.  After coordinating with the company and flight attendants and briefing the passengers; we taxied to the gate. During the taxi we did not experience anymore smoke and fumes. Maintenance technicians checked the aircraft out; informed us that the 'B' system hydraulic system was over serviced and had entered in the ventilation system where it produced the smoke and fumes. Continued flying would not have improved our situation; so I was glad we made a prompt return. I think the decision to take the aircraft flying was not good in retrospect; but all of us thought there was no reason; at the time; to not go flying.  I have had similar situations just like this and the problem went away once there was sufficient air moving through the cabin. Looking back; even though there was contradictory inputs from the F/A's; there was still enough to warrant a return to gate. The problems with O2 masks is unacceptable.  Maybe they would have worked better at higher altitudes (we only climbed to 6000 ft); but it made the flight deck workload very high and challenging.",,,,"Flight Crew flying 737-800 aircraft encountered smoke and fumes in cabin after takeoff.",

As we were descending from cruise and deviating around enroute weather; we were in the clear deviating far from any cells; we started hearing a repetitive muffled pounding sound that seemed like the flight attendants banging on a cart; or a sound along those lines. It wasn't too loud as to startle us; but strange. I looked at our engine instruments and all seemed normal at that point as our power was reduced for the descent. There was no great adverse yaw due to little power and the autopilot being on. Shortly after hearing the noise and asking each other what that could be; the flight attendants called up and reported a banging noise coming from the number one engine.  We could feel very tiny vibrations. I looked at the gauges and remember seeing both N1's in the 40% range; with no engine limits exceeded. I increased power on both engines; and sure enough; I got no response from the number one engine. It appeared to just be windmilling or providing idle power possibly.After confirming the power loss while on the interphone with the flight attendants; we [advised ATC] due to an engine failure; and we were given direct routing. Pilot Monitoring ran the appropriate checklist which led to shutting down and securing the number one engine as the EGT was high and we felt some minor vibrations. Just before completely shutting the engine down; the ENG FAIL light did eventually illuminate. The Pilot Monitoring answered repeated questions with ATC and since we were in a descent; things were moving fast. There we lots of cells out there I had to deviate around. I focused on flying the airplane and keeping control. I was able to leave the autopilot engaged and trimmed the aircraft as appropriate. ATC came back and said there was a thunderstorm building on the field that was not moving away.  As we got closer; we had ATC ask the tower the current conditions and the status on that thunderstorm cell. Since it hadn't moved; winds were increasing; and possibly having to go IMC to land in the Pilot Monitoring after discussing it with me; requested a diversion to an airport where the sky was clear; winds light; a long runway; and no weather in sight.After completing the checklist and coordinating with ATC; at some point we changed the destination in the FMC and notified Dispatch. The passengers were also briefed of the situation both earlier about the engine failure; and later about the diversion. The flight attendants were also rebriefed about the diversion. We also requested to have emergency trucks standing by. I briefed the new approach and reviewed the engine failure profile; single engine go-around procedure again; and requested direct to a fix prior to the FAF so we could get stable. I flew the engine out profile as trained to an uneventful hand flown approach and landing. After clearing the runway; we contacted the emergency vehicle on another frequency and they confirmed everything looked normal. One of the trucks followed us to the terminal and we parked at the gate. As we opened the door; Maintenance came on board. We deadheaded to our scheduled overnight on an Airbus that was coming in about an hour to resume our trip.  The Pilot Monitoring communicated very well and great CRM throughout the whole flight.  He always asked for my inputs; as well as I did his. We had flown together several times over the years which led to good camaraderie and CRM.  I feel we worked well as a team and were well trained to complete the mission in this most stressful situation.  Both of us have extensive experience and many years flying the 737. I want to say the flight attendants did a good job calming passengers on both our flight and the flight back that we deadheaded on.

About 15-20 seconds later the engine initiated a successful auto relight. The engine operated normally for the remainder of the flight. I requested priority handling with ATC (Air Traffic Control). I was concerned that the engine might eventually fail and elected to divert into ZZZ1. We decided to land with Flaps 15 for performance considerations should the engine fail on final approach. We also elected to hold for a couple of circuits to get setup for the approach into ZZZ1 and to get our before landing checklist completed. Passengers and flight attendants were briefed during the hold. We told ATC that we would be stopping on the runway so that ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) could inspect our #1 engine before we continued to taxi to our gate. During the runway inspection aircraft maintenance conducted a visual inspection of our #1 engine while at idle and recommended we shut it down due to abnormal surging or pulsation.

We landed in ZZZ without further incident.There was an entry in the aircraft logbook that the aircraft may have had a 'foam ingestion event' approximately eight or nine days earlier.Since the cause is not yet determined; I can only speculate that the engine failure may have been related to the described FOD (Foreign Object Damage) ingestion.",,"B737 Flight Crew encountered an un-commanded inflight engine shutdown that resulted in a diversion.",

Until point of malfunction aircraft operated with no observed anomalies or deficiencies. Flight was smooth and routine until shortly after reaching Top of Descent and leaving FL380. Descending from FL380 to FL300 Auto Fail light illuminated on pressurization panel. Estimate the illumination of the Auto Fail light occurred around FL370. First Officer acting as Pilot Monitoring located appropriate checklist in QRH and we commenced working through the items contained therein. Completed QRH 2.4. The Auto Fail light extinguished and we continued normal operation with panel now set to ALTN mode. Shortly thereafter there was erratic behavior in the differential pressure and cabin altitude gauge. The changes were noticeable in ears as the pressure/cabin altitude changed quickly in either direction. Scanned overhead panel and noticed the ALTN light no longer illuminated. Verbalized to First Officer that we should put our masks on. At this point estimate the aircraft was between FL360 and FL300 which was the initial floor of our assigned descent from ATC.  We both donned masks and within moments the Cabin Altitude light illuminated with corresponding warning horn and a very noticeable drop in pressure. Called for and First Officer immediately secured and began with the Cabin Altitude Warning QRC. PASS OXY ON light illuminated as well indicating Cabin Oxygen masks had deployed. Accomplished Cabin Altitude Warning QRC. Cabin altitude spiked but can't recall to what altitude. At one point; cabin descended rapidly and diff pressure climbed to redline on gauge.Outflow valve seemed to be uncontrollable; which made the onboard pressurization issue uncontrollable.  Coordinated with ATC for lower altitude and maintained an expedited descent that was essentially unbroken until landing. At completion of QRC we were directed to accomplish QRH 2.1. Used 2.1 through entire descent and uneventful landing.  During descent while coordinating with cabin crew; flight attendants informed flight deck crew that one passenger briefly lost consciousness but was awake again and being attended to by cabin crew. Notified ATC of need for EMS to meet aircraft at gate upon arrival. ATC facilitated request and local EMS met aircraft and evaluated passenger.  Upon arrival coordinated with Dispatch; both local Company Maintenance and Maintenance Control and Chief Pilot; to ensure aircraft abnormalities were properly documented in logbook; crew was taken care of and all other pertinent issues had been addressed.  I think this was an anomaly and part of flying aircraft as a business. Things break. Just glad it turned out the way it did. As far as self evaluation goes; I did forget a few items that bug me. One; I should've let the First Officer handle communication with the cabin as I ended up unnecessarily task loading myself. Also; I forgot to send an ACARs to Dispatch or radio them letting them know about the situation. We were pretty busy but no excuse. I'm pretty sure ATC notified Company if only just the local ops folks. The checklist was handled correctly but as ALTN system failed and we were directed to go to manual. The cabin pressure spiked and dropped several times and then failed. That was certainly an enormous distraction and it took us a minute to get masks on and fully reengaged with the checklist. Feel like I could've done a better job leading in those moments. Will say that I was very happily surprised by how much our training kicked in; when the event got bad. Kudos to the training folks!",,"A routine flight changed as we began our initial descent. Aircraft pressurization began to fail which led to the loss of cabin pressurization. Between FL380 and FL360 the Auto Fail light illuminated; along with corresponding dashes in the FLT ALT window and LAND ALT window on the landing altitude selector panel. I was the PM for this leg; and as such I completed the QRH 2.4 Auto Fail Checklist. This drove the pressurization mode selector to be placed in the ALT mode. This did extinguish the Auto Fail light and temporarily allowed for control of the outflow valve. At this point the CPT and I felt pressure changes in our heads and noticed somewhat erratic oscillations in both the cabin differential and cabin altitude. The Captain made the decision to don the O2 masks at this point. I referred back to the QRH 2.4 Checklist as the cabin altitude was now not controllable. The checklist drove us to selecting the manual mode on the Pressurization Mode Selector. The Captain communicated with the cabin crew to; as to their status and the status of the passengers. We were approaching FL300 at this point and communicated with ATC that we needed lower; due to a cabin pressurization problem.Very shortly after donning our O2 masks the CAB ALT light illuminated along with the corresponding warning horn. Captain called for QRC Cabin Altitude Warning Checklist. We were granted lower by ATC as well as handoff to APP Control. Thanks to both ATC and Approach and Tower; we were able to basically keep our descent going all the way down from cruise to 6000'; and subsequent visual approach. The passenger O2 masks deployed automatically as we worked through the QRC Checklist. The Captain; again; checked in with the Cabin Crew to verify O2 masks had been deployed as well as their wellbeing. We learned here that a female passenger had fallen unconscious temporarily. She regained consciousness as we descended. As I continued to monitor the cabin altitude and manipulate the outflow valve the CPT let APP know we needed EMS standing by for her. At the completion of the QRC we continued on with 2.1 of the QRH and stayed with this checklist for the duration of the flight. The cabin altitude depressurized; as necessary; as we descended below 10;000 feet. The approach and landing were uneventful. I contacted Operations taxiing in to the gate and verified with them our request for EMS to meet us. They had not received word about the Passenger needing assistance. I fully thought I had contacted them airborne. This must have been missed on my part in all the commotion. Nonetheless; EMS showed up within a few minutes of setting the parking brake. The Captain proceeded to contact the Chief Pilot; Maintenance; and Dispatch to proceed with the necessary paperwork and communications. The things that I see could have been improved upon are communications and understanding task loading. Verifying each of our required tasks were accomplished could have been better. As these events unfolded rapidly; it definitely emphasized the importance of keeping a good pace; usually a slower pace; as tasks have the potential to be compounded.",,"B737-800 flight crew reported a normal landing following the loss of pressurization at top of descent.",

It was grounded for more than 72 hours prior to our flight. Experienced significant delay (about 3.5 hours) due to thunder storm in terminal area. On pushback we got the EEC ALTN lights. Prior to taxi; with parking brake set CA (Captain) called [Dispatch] for patch to [Maintenance Control] ENG. Spoke to [Maintenance] about problem. Noted CA reset EECs; with ALTN extinguished. Inquired if there was any issue with continuing. Maintenance inquired about CDS flags or other cautions. None observed; OK to continue per [Maintenance]. Normal taxi out and initial takeoff. A/T disengaged almost simultaneously with the airspeed on FO (First Officer) reaching 100 knots (about 60 knots on CA display who was PF [Pilot Flying]). After startle; then quick cross check FO called out 100 knots and that there was a problem with airspeed indications ... noting his were normal. Transfer of PF duties prior to V1 ... normal rotation and takeoff by FO. Flew out on departure and got the aircraft cleaned up and safely away from the ground. Continued climb out to get out of MOD TURB in area due to TS to allow for troubleshooting. Informed ATC of the problem and asked to stop at FL200. Overspeed clacker started and we elected to stop the climb and initiate descent to 10;000 feet to continue troubleshooting. CA as PNF (Pilot Not Flying) was distracted by the EEC issue and slow to realize the Airspeed Unreliable situation. FO and [the jumpseater] did great job in keeping ACFT in safe envelope. Turbulence and distractions from warnings and annunciations contributed to PNF not completing all QRH checklists. Hand flown ILS to VIS runway XXL after speaking with flight attendants; passengers; and ACARS message to [Dispatch] of return and EMERG. Uneventful; safe; under max weight landing on RWY XXL.

Good CRM and communication between crew.

Spoke to [Union] member who noted that it seemed to be a good opportunity for learning; and I agree.",,"I was sitting in the jumpseat of Aircraft X on this particular day. ZZZ was experiencing very bad thunderstorms that morning. It was a [morning] scheduled departure that finally pushed back about [afternoon] local time. As we pushed back and started both engines I observed the crew doing their after start check. Running through their flow they received a Master Caution and it was in reference to the EEC's; both were lit Amber (Fault). The Captain reached up and reset them and the lights went out. He then called dispatch and [Maintenance Control] since we were off of the gate. He explained to [Maintenance Control] what happened and what he did. I looked at the FO (First Officer) and I was not quite sure if he was ok with that or not. [Maintenance Control] seemed to agree with the fix and we started to taxi out. Everything went well on the taxi out. We lined up on runway XYL received the takeoff clearance and then off we went. It was the Capt's leg. The next set of events I was a little unsure for a few seconds of what was taking place because both pilots had on Bose headsets so I could not hear their conversation clearly as their voices were not loud enough for me. This is a guess; but somewhere around 100kts I witnessed a transfer of controls and I saw a Master Caution light up. I looked straight up and I saw the EEC's both amber again. I then looked back at the flight controls and I figured out why they exchanged flight controls; I saw the IAS Disagree on the FO PFD. Going back to the 100kts; I am guessing it was around that speed because we were on the runway for a while before the V1 and Rotate call. Once airborne both pilots performed the PF and PNF (Pilot Flying and Pilot Not Flying) duties according to procedures. When I saw there was a break I asked the Capt to please hand me his QRH so I can at least help them get started on the problem. I looked up IAS Disagree and that led me to the Airspeed Unreliable checklist in the QRH. I turned to the table of content pages for Airpeed Unreliable 737-800 and handed the book to the Capt. Honestly I did not realize that was not the beginning of that checklist; I saw 737-800 under Airspeed Unreliable and I just went to 737-800 Airspeed Unreliable. It led me to the climb charts for the non-normal. I handed the QRH to the Capt. and he looked through the checklist. He read the tables and then decided to run the EEC checklist. Again he reached up and reset the EEC's I then stated and the FO backed me up; the EEC's are not your problem right now it's your Airspeed. He kept insisting that the EEC's needed to be handled first.During this time the FO was hand flying and getting bumped around pretty bad by the weather. We were still climbing out and then the Capt decided to [advise ATC] and return back to ZZZ. I believe we were at 13;500 climbing to 16;000. I then noticed on the FO PFD Altitude Disagree amber message. I was then fixated on assisting the FO with any airspeed deviations and altitude issues. I did see the FO had a really good handle on cross checking his PFD with the STBY PFD. He was doing an excellent job with everything. As we started a descent back down to 10;000 ft the Capt. Airspeed was doing like 330kts plus giving us a clacker and I think stick shaker. It was because of the erroneous info coming from the Capt side. Between 12;000 and 10;000 ft the IAS Disagree went away and the Altitude Disagree went away. Once we leveled off at 10;000 ft the Capt set the airplane up for arrival back into ZZZ and did the whole briefing for the FO; contacted OPS. During this time I [advise] the FA's (Flight Attendants) and spoke to the passengers. At this time in my mind I was wondering why there was no memory item in the checklist. However I later realized during debrief with the FO when I went to 737-800 that was not at the beginning of the checklist. We then started our descent and headed back for ZZZ and the IAS Disagree came back. As the FO asked to be configuredthe Capt. Airspeed went to 45kts again giving him the clacker and the shaker then I remember the airplane said either 'Too Low' or 'Airspeed' I can't remember which one. Again I couldn't hear all communications between the pilots because they had the BOSE headsets but I did hear the FO say something about running the QRC. The Capt. hesitated for a second but then ran through the Airspeed Unreliable QRC. He read through it and I couldn't see it clearly to back him up. As the clacker was going off the Capt turned his attention back to the PF. Then finally I said; 'Flight Director's need to be off then on to flying pilot' at the same time the Capt was reaching up on the MCP to turn them off I assume. Once that happened and the Master was back on the FO side then things calmed down. The FO landed the aircraft on XXL; again doing a superb job; and the Capt took the aircraft about 100kts and barked orders to tell the Fire Trucks no assistance needed and to tell the tower what gate they were going to. Then he asked me to tell the Pax 'Remain Seated Remain Seated' as we pulled off of the runway. We got to the gate and we did a small debrief but then the Capt contacted the {Operations Management]. The FO thought he forgot something on his initial walk around so he went back out for a postflight walk around just to double check. Fire Dept came to the Aircraft to check on the crew and then I exited. Once we swapped airplanes and was on our way. Overhearing what I could of the crews conversation; they were continuing the debrief they had on the last airplane after I walked away. To me it sounded as if the FO was questioning the Capt of why they did not abort the takeoff as they were both referencing the FOM and what constitutes an Abort. The Capt stated he only had a split second to make a decision of a highspeed abort and felt that the situation was under control so it was better to take the aircraft airborne because highspeed aborts can be dangerous. The FO was not too happy with that answer and they discussed this more. The FO then reviewed the EEC checklist and in the checklist it makes mention of messages on the Control Display Panel. The FO says that alone should have stopped him from running that checklist. The Capt did not think there were any messages on the Control Display and then I backed the FO up and said well you did have IAS Disagree and Altitude Disagree messages. The Capt said that he did not see the Altitude Disagree message. In the end the Capt did accept responsibility and said that once the plane was under control and the FO was flying that he should have disconnected and managed the situation better and read the checklist more careful. Instead he admitted that he was more concern of the aircraft being flown. They seem to agree on that and the Capt. did say he learned a lesson and will reflect on it. They both discussed about writing the [report] and then we continued on our way uneventful. There are a lot of lessons to be learned here; I am just not sure if the Capt had trust in the FO. Not saying this particular FO but just FO's in general. This could have been handled a lot better had the PNF taken input better and took his time.",,"B-737 flight crew; including jumpseat pilot; reported an uneventful emergency air return due to a malfunctioning EEC on takeoff.",

We flew in MVFR to VFR mostly. I believe we leveled off at 12;000 feet and then CA notified ATC. EEC checklist was performed but I don't recall CDS (Common Display System) displaying DSPLY SOURCE. I reminded him to pull out the QRC Unreliable Airspeed checklist which was pulled out although FD (Flight Director) switches were omitted by the CA and never turned off (I should have verified this memory item) The CA never read the QRH for the Unreliable Airspeed checklist; but the person on the jumpseat did (not sure if he was delegated for the QRH reading by the CA); omitting the conditions for the checklist and some other items but catching the FD switches verifying the pitch and power settings from the QRH for '800 series. Normal arrival with delayed vectors and landing performed. The flight never exceeded any flight parameters and limitations and stayed in normal flight envelope at all times. During the flight CA airspeed varied from 330 plus activating the high speed clacker to as low as 46 activating the stall shaker making the communication at times difficult.

Looking down at the engine indications; I saw N1 and N2 decreasing; followed by ENG FAIL displayed on our EGT for the #1 engine.The Captain obtained the Engine Failure or Shutdown QRH and gave me the radios; as I was already pilot flying. The CA (Captain) notified ATC that we had an engine failure but did not declare an emergency. At this time; our EGT indicator was reaching its max limitation and the CA made the decision to move the start lever to cutoff; prior to reaching this step in our Engine Failure checklist; to try and prevent exceeding our EGT max limitation. Continuing with the Engine Failure Checklist; we reached the engine restart portion; at which point the CA decided to do an In-Flight Restart. I stated that we exceeded the EGT limit and because of that; I questioned if we should restart the engine. The CA felt comfortable proceeding and explained that when restarting; or if at any point; we see the EGT rapidly increasing or approaching its limitation; we would shut the #1 engine down. I agreed with his plan; and ultimately felt we could still maintain a safe operation. The CA proceeded through the In-Flight Start Checklist. The start was successful and indications were normal. At this point; we were still descending and being vectored onto approach. I believe we were on about an 18 mile final. I began to configure early and when bringing throttles up; we felt a light vibration again. We decided to continue the approach in a partial single engine configuration with the left throttle at idle thrust; when the left throttle was at idle; there was no vibration and the engine indication were within parameters. We felt it was safer to keep the engine at idle rather than shutting it down during this phase of flight. When we felt the vibration after the second engine start; we notified ATC to contact ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) to meet us as a precaution. Previously; the CA had pulled up performance numbers for single engine approach and flaps 15. Additionally; the runway was 12250ft; so we both felt comfortable landing with our configuration. The CA ran the single engine landing checklist and I landed the airplane. After landing; I did my after landing flow; the CA shutdown the #1 engine and we taxied to the gate.Looking back on this event; I would have changed a few things. First; I would have [requested priority handling] as soon as ATC was notified that we lost an engine. Second; rather than restarting the engine after it had exceeded its limitation; I feel we could have left the engine shutdown and proceeded single engine. Third; despite having been very busy; we should have notified the FA's (Flight Attendants) and Dispatch.",,,,"First Officer reported an uncommanded inflight engine shutdown; causing a partial single engine landing.",

We requested a level off at 15;000 feet from ATC to work through the QRH. The Captain was flying and took over the radios while I got out the QRH and ran through the appropriate checklists. After going through and performing the 'Airspeed Unreliable' checklist within the QRH; we determined that the Captain's side airspeed and altitude indications were the most reliable then the QRH led us to go to 'ALTN' ADC on the FO side. We then asked for a climb to our filed final altitude from ATC and they cleared us to climb to 'FL410'.While climbing through 'FL250' at approximately XA:15Z the 'AILERON LOCKOUT' and 'RUDDER RATIO' EICAS messages illuminated. The captain was flying and took over the radios while I got out the QRH and ran through the appropriate checklists. We then called company dispatch and maintenance on the SATCOM to get guidance on continuing the flight to ZZZ1. Dispatch and Maintenance as well as we the flight crew were in agreement that their were no DDG or ETOPS reasons that prohibited us from continuing to ZZZ1. Continuing our climb; we noticed a vibration/rumble throughout the airfame and in the control column. The Captain disengaged the auto pilot to see if there were any aircraft control problems; there were none. We leveled off at 'FL370' and asked ATC to show that as our final altitude. The unidentified vibration/rumble continued to worsen as airspeed increased. The Captain decreased power to slow our speed to determine if the vibration/rumble would decrease in intensity which it did slightly but was still very abnormal. The decision was made between the crew that we didn't feel safe continuing to ZZZ1 with this new condition. The Captain transferred the controls to me and he contacted company dispatch to inform them of the situation and decision to return to ZZZ as well as ask for a redispatch to ZZZ. I transferred the controls back to the Captain then contacted ZZZ2 ARINC on HF radio; since we were now in oceanic airspace; to request a clearance to return to ZZZ.  We were given a clearance to return directly to ZZZ. As we got closer to ZZZ; we requested a descent. We decided also to run through the 'Airspeed Unreliable' checklist once again to re-verify that the Captain's side data was reliable.After doing this; as per the QRH; we tried engaging the Left Autopilot and it would not engage.

FO started down at 1000 fpm. We were then given a late-night 'Direct ZZZ' clearance and the thrust levers came back to idle. The #1 engine soon thereafter indicated ENG FAIL which was a bit disconcerting. The EGT for #1 was significantly higher than #2. I grabbed the QRH and said I was planning on running the ENG FAIL checklist while we evaluated the engine indications. The EGT at this point was above 800. I elected to do an immediate shutdown. We verified the engine and went to cutoff. The EGT was just in the red and began falling after cutoff and I continued the ENG FAIL checklist.I conveyed our engine failure condition to ATC and we were switched to Approach and checked in. Based on the normal indications on #1; we talked about a restart. The FO expressed his concern regarding restarting an engine after it had exceeded EGT redline. We ultimately agreed to restart with the understanding that an immediate shutdown may be required. Considering this; I got single-engine landing performance for the [long] Runway XXR in ZZZ. The XB restart went well and the engine appeared to be in a stable idle condition. During the Engine In-Flight Start; step #10 dictates; 'Engine GEN Switch; affected side... ON;' which I did. Considering the APU was already on the bus I realized later that it might've been wise to leave it on the APU versus loading up an already questionable engine.Later during the approach; the FO applied power and the #1 began to shudder. He brought #1 back to idle and continued the intercept and approach with the #2 - #1 remained idle. We worked through the One Engine Inop Landing Checklist. I had not officially [requested priority handling] at this point. I had neglected to do that on my initial engine-out report. The FO reminded me of this and I got it done. Considering the first indication of a problem was during descent; there was not much extra time. I didn't feel like contact with Dispatch would've been beneficial as we were fine on performance and proceeding to our destination.During descent at low power settings the engine failure and restart was transparent to the passengers; according to the FAs (Flight Attendant) later. I did not advise the FAs because of the time crunch and an expectation of a relatively normal landing. In retrospect I definitely should have given them a heads-up if for no other reason than to explain the presence of fire trucks after landing. After a flawless approach and nice landing by the FO - we had briefed no #1 reverse thrust - I taxied off the runway; shut #1 down; and taxied to Gate XX for the subsequent phone calls to Maintenance; FODO (Flight Operations Duty Officer); etc. We both spoke with the FAs about the situation.

As we approached the WX the Center controller handed us off to the next sector. We checked on descending thru around FL300 and the controller stated he was irritated about everyone stepping on each other. He then called us to see if we were on frequency. We acknowledged his call and about that time I noticed traffic approaching us and they appeared to be at FL290. I was confused as we seemed to be descending right into them and the controller never mentioned them. About the time I realized we were going to conflict with the traffic we received a CLIMB RA (Resolution Advisory). I immediately followed the RA procedure and climbed until we received the 'clear of conflict' message around FL300. Somewhere in that time the controller asked if we were level at FL300 and we told him negative; that we were cleared to descend to FL240. He seemed very confused about our previous descent clearance and our check-on. He then cleared us direct ZZZZZ1 and to descend via the [arrival] which we did. WX deviation combined with a badly timed hand off. Also seems like the center controllers are being tasked with multiple frequencies and sectors and they are very task loaded when traffic picks up. I felt like I was a bit slow to recognize the threat and I could have slowed our descent thru FL300 until it was clarified; but in all reality the speed in which the event occurred combined with the doubt that what you're actually seeing is accurate lead to the delay. I had the range dialed out and at first I thought the traffic must be further away or the controller would have mentioned it. I thought for a few seconds that we must be descending thru the other aircraft's altitude in time to avoid a conflict. I was also working my descent around a large cell and trying to stay above several smaller buildups as we passed it but still keep the aircraft on profile when we rejoined the arrival. Multiple aircraft communicating at once also played a major role in the confusion. As is the case with so many incidents it all came to together at the WRONG time. If it looks like a conflict; change your flight path first and figure it out. It seems obvious to say; but just remembering that stuff just gets missed and ATC misses things just like the rest of us helps keep your awareness up when something just doesn't look right. Too easy to get lulled into a sense of complacency thinking 'that can't REALLY be an aircraft headed right towards us this close to our altitude.' We are always the last line of defense up there and we need to keep that in mind.

While we were descending to FL240 we got a TCAS TA due to an aircraft that was below us and was the reason we were restricted to FL240.

I recall seeing it was out which was a relief but it didn't change our goal of landing ASAP. After being transferred to ZZZ Approach we were given vectors to lose the remaining altitude since we were so close to the airport. After being cleared for the visual approach to ZZZ I announced to ATC our intentions to stop on the runway and not evacuate until CFR had an opportunity to verify with a thermal scanner we had no fire in the cargo compartment. The landing was normal and after stopping CFR approached the AC and verified the temperature of the cargo compartment was 140F which was indicative of no fire. We then taxied to the gate and the passengers were deplaned. During the event we were so time constrained I didn't make time to review the QRH which would have instructed us to deplane the passengers before the cargo compartment was opened. I neglected to do that and it was opened as soon as we parked at the gate. CFR unloaded the baggage for inspection and found a portable speaker with an overheated battery which had burned the bag it was stored in and several adjacent to it. After gate arrival a passenger was taken by the paramedics. I don't know his complaint.",,"A319 flight crew reported a small cargo fire that resulted in a diversion.",

This was the start of leg 2 for the day as we already operated out of ZZZ. There was another issue I will discuss after the conclusion of our [priority handling] event. [The] FO (First Officer) was pilot flying at the time. We took off out of ZZZ1 in very light rain throughout our departure. My FO stated it was barely enough rain to notice on the windshield. Light chop may have been experienced temporarily at most; but it was mostly smooth on climb out. We were cleared to flight level 31;000 where we stopped our descent. Shortly thereafter; while autopilot B was engaged; the autopilot started a significant descent all by itself. Unbeknownst to me and after speaking with my FO on the ground; the FO noticed his altimeter jumped from 31;000 ft. to 31;800 approximately. As soon as the autopilot started its descent; I took controls from the FO; disconnected the autopilot and leveled the airplane at 31;000 using my altimeter. I don't think we lost much altitude because I almost immediately disconnected the autopilot to arrest the pitch down moment. ATC shortly queried our altitude and we read back 31;000. ATC stated he saw us at approximately 31;700. About that time I looked over at the FO side and saw his altitude was the same as ATC verified 31700 ft. and looked at my display; which showed 31;000ft. ALT disagree was showing. At the same time; I noticed the FO airspeed was significantly slower than my airspeed and cross-checked the standby indicator - FO airspeed approximately 80 kt. slow. Airspeed disagree showed.At some point; I issued a pan pan pan. Standby airspeed and CA airspeed was the same and based on our thrust setting and altitude there was no doubt my FO's airspeed indicator was incorrect; 70-80 kt. too slow for our thrust and pitch setting. At that point; I determined; maybe incorrectly as I analyzed things on the ground; that since ATC had his altitude readout; I was basing our actual altitude on my FO's display and airspeed on my display. My reasoning is that 700-800 ft. high was safer than 700-800 ft. low; close to the ground; during approach and landing. Since I was now flying airspeed on my side and altitude on my FO's side; my altitude fluctuated up and down due to a gigantic 4 ft. scan instead of a normal 10 in. scan. Once I determined I could not hold altitude as expected; I asked for a block of altitude for airspace protection and was granted that clearance. The QRH for airspeed disagree was started; which led us to unreliable airspeed. We completed the checklist for unreliable airspeed and turned back towards ZZZ1. At some point after this realization I changed our pan pan to [requesting priority handling]. ATC apparently missed our [priority handling request] as he [provided priority handling] for us several minutes after I made the call myself. Upon realizing our altitude and airspeed unreliable; and ATC confirming ZZZ2 was VFR; I decided to turn back around another time to divert to ZZZ2 as it was a safer airport. Eventually; several altitude step downs were given to us for our descent into ZZZ2. QRH was completed and calls to Dispatch were then attempted.FO tried numerous times to contact company to relay our status and was unsuccessful. We attempted several calls on ZZZ3 Radio with no response. We asked ATC to call company and to contact us via ZZZ3 Radio; with no response from Dispatch. We then called on Guard to ask them to contact our Dispatch and let them know to contact us on ZZZ3 Radio; communication with Dispatch was never successful. With everything going on; I did not feel comfortable having my FO heads down sending an ACARS message...we were too busy.Descent checklist was soon completed and approach checklist was completed below 18;000. Holds were also accomplished to allow us time for checklists and getting weather info and setting up for the approach into ZZZ2 which were indicating 1100 ft. ceilings and better than required visibility. At some point in the descent; below 10;000 ft.; my FO realized the EEC were both in alternate mode and a discussion commenced. We discussed the thrust lever position and thrust changes that occurred in ALT mode but due to our [priority handling situation] and attempting to get the airplane on the ground safely; I forgot to have the FO run the QRH for the EEC alternate mode. Due to having no weather forecast and knowing weather was in the vicinity of ZZZ2 due to the hurricane remnants; my main concern was getting the aircraft on the ground safely in as close to VFR conditions as I could get.After landing; while discussing the events with my FO; we realized we probably should have made time to run this QRH procedure. I just didn't have the weather info in flight to make a call to continue holding to accomplish this checklist instead of landing. Landing VFR in my mind was a safer option than running this checklist and possibly losing VFR conditions due to hurricane remnants. The approach was set up and briefed and we commenced our approach. Checklists completed. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) standing by for us. The approach and landing was uneventful.After landing we were given instructions to taxi down a taxiway; XX or XY; [which] I did not feel was safe for us to turn down [to] as it was too narrow for my comfort. I also had concern that the taxiway could support our weight and relayed to Ground Control that I would not be accepting that taxiway. We did a 180 on a closed runway as Ground gave us permission to do so and frankly; that was our only option due to where the aircraft was stopped on the taxiway.We then returned to [the FBO] and parked. [The] incident was written in [the] logbook with my initial impression on what happed; the caution messages we received and that I thought airspeed was good on my side only and altitude was good on the FO side only. Airplane was chocked and secured; no door seals were on the aircraft. We shut down; secured the airplane; and then did the supplementary procedure for powering the aircraft down. We then exited the aircraft and closed the door. We called for the FBO to remove the stairs from the airplane for security purposes. The stairs were then pulled back from the aircraft and we exited the Ramp into the FBO. [The] Chief Pilot; DOO; Dispatch and Maintenance Control [were] all notified via my personal phone. The earlier situation I referenced was a runway change at clearance for pushback. Since we had not started the engines or changed configuration; I had the FO change our assigned runway and then consulted the TLR (Thrust Lever Resolver) for new numbers. I showed the FO the TLR data and he verified correct data for runway change. I then read him the new data to input since we were pushing back. What I did not realize is that RTO1 had not been selected at that time; but all other number were entered. At some point during the takeoff; prior to 60 kt.; thrust was set; I noticed we had TO (Takeoff) selected instead of RTO1 based on the N1 setting. When I referenced our airspeed at this realization; we had already exceeded 80 kt. I think I made the 80 kt. call at 82 kt. I determined the safest outcome was to continue the takeoff based on our rejected takeoff parameters. I had in the back of my mind a 5 kt. difference in V1 between RTO1 and TO as I had looked earlier due to the weather in ZZZ1 at the time. This situation has led me to realize it is most likely a better habit to have the FO read off the TLR data and I enter the numbers myself in the FMC. This was something I just didn't catch as I was starting to get tired from sitting there for an extended time.[The cause was] airspeed and altitude [being] unreliable due to an unknown problem. After reflecting on what occurred; I believe none of the altitude or airspeed information on my FO's outboard display unit was correct. I erroneously believed that ATC's readout of our altitude confirmed my FO's altimeter was correct without realizing his entire system had likely failed; providing erroneous information to ATC. The weather from the hurricane was certainly a contributing factor as my main concern was getting the airplane on the ground safely and landing in VFR conditions.",,"Unreliable airspeed was the first issue. While flying level at FL310 it was my leg; and autopilot B was engaged. Suddenly; my altimeter shot up to FL317 and the autopilot initiated a descent. The Captain immediately took controls and disconnected the autopilot. As we were cross-checking and trying to gain an understanding of the state of the airplane; ATC queried our altitude because they showed us at FL317 instead of 310. Cross-checking revealed that the FO (First Officer) side was indeed showing FL317 while the CA (Captain) side showed FL310. Simultaneously; the FO-side airspeed showed an enormous slowing trend. Lastly; IAS and ALT disagree messages popped up on both the FO- and CA-sides.The Captain declared a pan pan pan at first then a bit later; [priority handling was requested]; but ATC apparently missed the call as he [requested priority handling] for us at a later time. The [priority handling] was reported [due to] unreliable airspeed and altimeter disagreement. I ran the checklist for IAS DISAGREE; which referred me to the UNRELIABLE AIRSPEED Checklist. In communicating with ATC; we determined that the standby and CA-side altitude did not agree with ATC; and the CA-side airspeed made the most sense when compared to the ATC reports. The difference was about 80 kt. between CA- and FO-side IAS. Also; the displayed GS was always within about 10 kt. of ATC's speed reports. At this point; the Captain was flying with reference to his airspeed and the FO's altitude.The Captain initially asked for a return to ZZZ1 and a block of altitude as he struggled fly with reference to both sides. Because there was still about a 700 ft. discrepancy between FO- and CA-side altimeters; it was decided to pick a field that had VFR landing conditions. The nearest such airfield was ZZZ2. As I continued with the checklist; we selected 'all on 1' on the ALT SOURCE switch. At that time; the 'disagree' messages went away; and the airspeed matched; but altimeters still did not agree. Upon reflection; I realize that the Captain had transitioned to the local altimeter setting below 18000; but I was still in the standard 29.92. Once I updated my altimeter setting; both altimeters matched. Now the only error message was 'source 2' because we had de-selected it. The checklist also directed to disable transponder altitude reporting. It occurred to us later that the transponder may have been providing ATC an erroneous altitude because it was coupled to the FO-side. At some point; unclear exactly when; we noticed the EEC switches were both showing ALTN with the corresponding ENG master caution. Once the UNRELIABLE AIRSPEED checklist was completed; we spent the rest of the flight trying to contact Dispatch about our [situation] and diversion; but at this point; we were unsuccessful as we were probably too low to communicate over ARINC frequencies. We were also busy setting up the approach into ZZZ2. We landed without incident.The second issue was departure with wrong takeoff thrust programmed. When we were finally ready to push and start engines; Ground Metering advised us on an updated ATIS and were told to expect Runway XXR departure. I reloaded the SID in the FMS with the updated runway and got a message that V speeds were erased. I went to the page to re-load the V speeds while the Captain referenced the TLR (Thrust Lever Resolver) for the new speeds for the new runway. As he referenced the TLR; he read aloud that we still had an R-TO-1 takeoff; same flaps; same weight; same N1 values; and same CG. He then read me the new V speeds which I loaded in the FMS. Since the engines hadn't started yet; we considered these items as part of the preflight brief and declined to do a runway change checklist. At some point; the Captain noticed that we were at full TO (Takeoff) thrust instead of R-TO-1 thrust. My low time on the aircraft prevented me from having the experience necessary to know that changing the runway not only deleted the V speeds; but also deleted the takeoff thrust settings. I should have verified all of the information was still correct as the Captain read it out.The cause of TO data error was task saturation. Weather conditions at ZZZ1: IFR / rain / 500 ft. CIG / winds gusting around 15 from the east. Outside factors [include] delay to cargo loading. Pushed an hour late. Updated ATIS 3 times while waiting to depart. All 3 said departing on Runway XY. Realizing the transponder was transmitting erroneous altitude information earlier would have greatly simplified matters. All performance data should have been reviewed in the FMC for the runway change.",,"B737-800 flight crew reported an uneventful diversion due to unreliable airspeed and altitude indications during cruise.",

I ran checklists and accomplished communications with Dispatch and company.[Captain theorized possible cause] a blower motor failed.",,"Passing through FL355 on the way to FL370 (cruising altitude); we were talking about the bad ride and the tight allowance on the speed tape and decided to request and make FL350 our final. We received clearance and started down when we heard an unusual and loud noise. It seemed to be coming from underneath my oxygen mask area. A heavy and acrid smell of electrical burning hit us at the same time and we immediately went on oxygen and established communication. The Captain went to the Quick Reference Card and started running the checklist. I was looking at our close proximity to ZZZ and I heard 'LAND ASAP' and asked him if he was alright diverting to ZZZ (about 70-80 NM away). It was my aircraft and radios; so I advised ATC (ZZZ1 Center) and asked for immediate vectors to ZZZ with the intent to divert and land. We were given direct and cleared to FL240; then 11;000. By the time the Captain completed all of his tasks; I had us on a modified downwind and briefed him on our situation and asked him to brief ILS 33 for me. He mentioned my airspeed (308 knots below 10;000) and I told him I was using that airspeed to expedite our descent. The approach was stabilized and landing was uneventful; otherwise. We had CFR meet the aircraft immediately after landing and they cleared us with no signs of smoke and/or fire. We taxied to the gate with a CFR escort to ensure maximum safety. ZZZ ops and personal were fantastic and very professional. In my opinion; we immediately went to our training for a successful outcome and I believe we got everything done in a relatively short amount of time and stayed safe throughout the event.We can't necessarily prevent this type of event in the future and I believe it will be an unpopular opinion; but more training using the oxygen masks would benefit the pilot group. They are uncomfortable the captain running the checklist while inhaling with a hot mic was so loud I couldn't hear ATC at times. Movement of hot mic off while breathing greatly improved our communication.",,"A321 Captain reported noticing a 'smell of acrid smoke' during cruise resulting in a diversion.",

Pushback; start; taxi; takeoff and climb out were uneventful. Passing FL260 for a cruise altitude of FL270 the First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) identified a flashing oil quantity advisory reading and a low oil pressure indication on the #1 engine system display. Due to the aircraft's momentum and vertical rate of climb the Captain (Pilot Flying) elected to level off at FL270 as planned. Initially the zero oil quantity and low 60 PSI pressure indication were not accompanied by an ECAM message and system status indicated normal. Within a couple of minutes a series of intermittent ECAM cautions and warnings occurred leading to an engine shutdown condition. The amber ENG 1 OIL LO PR Caution illuminated first on the ECAM display. The crew responded by initiating the company non-normal checklist strategy. The Captain announced 'my aircraft' then the First Officer verified that the ECAM was not a Quick Action or ECAM exception item. The Captain elected to remain flying and also took control of the radio. It was a crew awareness only caution so the FO (First Officer) then checked the QRH for follow up items. This Caution does not direct the crew to adjust thrust settings. During this process the caution [message] cleared itself without any inputs from the crew but the zero oil quantity and 60 PSI indications remained. At this point the ECAM display was clear and system status indicated normal. Shortly thereafter the red ENG 1 LO PR warning illuminated on the ECAM display. This occurred intermittently 3 times and then cleared itself each time resulting in a normal system status display on the ECAM. Oil quantity remained at zero and pressure was now steady at 40 PSI on the system display. These intermittent ECAM warnings lasted for approximately 2-3 seconds and then cleared to a normal status for roughly the same amount of time. The next time the ECAM warning illuminated it remained steady and the crew followed the ENG 1 LO PR warning procedures and shutdown the engine. The crew notified Center and requested a radar vector descent to final for the engine out approach at ZZZ1. The non-normal indications initially occurred just prior to the ETP (equal time point) between ZZZ and ZZZ1. However by the time the ECAM directed engine shutdown the flight had progressed passed the ETP and was at a normal descent point for ZZZ1. Dispatch was called using the iPad crew phone and notified of the nature of the emergency and decision to land at ZZZ1. The flight attendants and passengers were briefed about the Precautionary Landing at ZZZ1 and the possibility of airport fire vehicles near the aircraft. After shutting down the engine and notifying ATC; the crew requested and was given a vector and descent direct to a left 10 NM base at ZZZ1. Descent and approach were very stable and normal. The Captain flew the descent and approach with both the autopilot and auto thrust on. Crew requested ARFF (airport rescue fire department) for the landing and cleared the runway for a brief inspection of the engine. On request of the crew the fire department followed the aircraft to the gate. Shutdown at the gate and passenger deplaning were normal. Note: ATC handling by ZZZ Center; ZZZ1 Approach and Tower were outstanding. Handoff from Tower to ARFF at ZZZ1 was seamless and well coordinated. Flight Attendant performance was also outstanding and the passengers remained well informed throughout the emergency. Although oil fault indications were somewhat intermittent and erratic the fact that multiple independent sensors indicated a problem caused the crew to shutdown the #1 engine when directed by the ENG LO PR Warning ECAM. After the flight; maintenance personnel initially reported normal engine oil quantity on a sight gauge even though the engine instrument remained at zero. Initially crew suspects a partial blockage or pump failure in the system without oil loss. The engine oil quantity and pressure indications were initially both alarming and confusing. As the adrenaline level increased for the crew due to the perception there would be an engine shutdown there was also a level of doubt that the indications were accurate. Low oil pressure on the engine instrument should be accompanied by a Low Pressure ECAM Caution or Warning. Why did the pressure remain steady in the amber range with zero on the quantity? This is an uncomfortable situation because our training does not address multiple oil failures without ECAM warnings. It puts the flight crew into one of those gray areas where a Captain is expected to make a decision based on the information he has on hand in a situation not covered in training. The natural instinct of a pilot is to shutdown an engine before complete oil loss to prevent a catastrophic failure. In this occurrence engine indications identified a problem well in advance of ECAM warnings. Yet crew training and aircraft procedures generally do not address engine shutdown without ECAM warning checklist direction. Should crews be given shutdown discretion in the absence of ECAM warnings and checklist? In this situation the Captain elected to continue as the Pilot Flying while the crew worked through the non-normal checklist strategy. Even though most aspects of company's non-normal strategy were performed correctly the overall pace and structure were hampered by the Captain continuing to fly. In this case the checklist strategy would have been better managed if the Captain had delegated flying to the FO. For example; when the ECAM directed the 'Engine Master Switch-Off' both pilots confirmed it was the #1 engine but the Captain positioned it to off. Procedure dictates that the non-flying pilot position the switch to off.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain flying A321 aircraft reports low engine oil pressure inflight.",

After departing ZZZ1 while climbing through Flight Level 280 on our way up to FL340 Autopilot #1 disconnected and would not reengage. A/P (Autopilot) #2 would engage but after about 30 seconds it also disengaged along with the auto thrust going into THRUST LOCK mode. Then several ECAMs (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) appeared including RUD TRIM1 FAULT; YAW DAMPER 1; RUD TRV LIM 1. The First Officer ran the Quick Reference Handbook procedures for each of those problems which included resetting the FACs (Flight Augmentation Computer).We leveled at FL340 and the aircraft was exhibiting a slight Dutch Roll tendency so we descended to FL280 and no more Dutch Roll was observed. Autopilots could be intermittently engaged; flight directors would come and go; autothrust would disengage in THRUST LOCK mode. We consulted with Dispatch and [Maintenance Control] via phone patch. Without further attempting to engage autopilots or autothrust events seemed to stabilize and with consult with Dispatch we planned to continue to destination. We began evaluating along route alternates and asked Dispatch to do the same. Shortly thereafter the flight directors started to come and go repeatedly along with the previously described ECAMS.

We had an A321 sharklet. Every portion of the beginning of the flight leg from gate departure; takeoff and climb up to the fume event was normal and routine. At sometime above 10;000 ft. we got a call from our #1 FA (Flight Attendant) telling us that the FAs in Economy Class more towards the rear of the aircraft were smelling a sweat odor and a more robust glue type odor. I believe from my prospective that the odor came from the back from the wings black wards because we did not smell anything in the flight deck and no one smelled anything in first class; #1 FA or forward section of the cabin behind 1st class section. Captain began trouble shooting the problem with the QRH guidelines and the FAs that was smelling the odors. One of the FAs was feeling ill from the fume which was strong in the area they were working. Passenger in that area smelled the odors as well. Captain asked if she can continue or do we need to get back to the gate in ZZZ so she can seek medical attention. She was not sure if she wanted to continue on toward ZZZZ1 or return. Captain asked the #1 FA to monitor the FA's condition and if she worsened we will return to ZZZ. While we were discussing the QRH fume trouble shooting pages and making plans to return to ZZZ or another airport that may be closer to our position if we continued to fly farther away from ZZZ; the #1 FA called and told us the FA that was feeling ill was on O2 and was not getting better. So we notified ATC that we will be returning to ZZZ which was the best option to land. We [were given priority handling] to expedite our return to ZZZ and so the FA can get the medical attention she needed. As we began to descend into ZZZ I remember it was below FL180 and through landing that the odors began to infiltrate the flight deck and the #1 FA and passengers began smelling it too. We donned our O2 masks. It was a sweaty smell and it also had an Elmer's glue order to us. The odors continued until we arrived to the gate. The FA that was really ill went to the hospital and the remaining flight crew continued with us to ZZZZ1 with a replacement FA.I don't know of any causal factors that would cause a fume event other than fixing the problem of the source that caused the fumes from escaping and preventing and future leaks from going into the cabin.The only thing that would prevent this from happening would be a complete redesign of the airplane systems that keeps the cabin ventilation isolated from any possible fume leaking into the cabin.",,,,"A321 First Officer reported a fumes event during departure climb resulting in a return to the departure airport.",

FO (First Officer) was pilot flying. Passing through 4;000 feet MSL on climbout from ZZZ we noticed a fuel imbalance developing - right wing main tank fuel indication already 400 pounds lower than left wing. Right wing main tank fuel appeared to be feeding at approximately twice the rate of the left and it appeared that the center tank fuel was not feeding at all. Engine fuel flow readings appeared normal and equal. By 10;000 feet MSL the imbalance had increased to the point that the IMBAL alert was activated. We coordinated with ATC to level off at 12;000 feet MSL in order to reduce fuel flow and begin taking appropriate action. Upon leveling at 12;000 feet MSL we observed the right fuel tank quantity feed rate appear to normalize and then observed a 50 pound increase in right main tank fuel quantity. Fuel imbalance at that point was 1;100 pounds. We initiated the IMBAL checklist in the QRH. Observing what then appeared to be normal tank quantity indications for a crossfeed operation; we coordinated with ATC to continue our climb and proceed on course to the destination knowing we would also coordinate with Dispatch and maintenance promptly to determine if proceeding to ZZZ1 was advisable. As soon as we established climb fuel flow settings and pitch attitude; the right main tank quantity began to decrease again at what appeared to be the same abnormal rate observed during the initial climb. We then requested priority handling initiated the return to ZZZ (nearest airport) and started the APU as a precaution. I advised Dispatch; the cabin crew; and the passengers of the situation using SOP. As soon as we stopped the climb to initiate the return to ZZZ the right main fuel tank indication again stopped decreasing at an abnormal rate. We concluded the IMBAL checklist and for the remainder of the flight we observed no further indications of abnormal rate of decrease in right main wing tank fuel. During the descent; I spoke with the flight attendants and they confirmed that there were no visible indications of fuel leaks on either wing or engine. We landed uneventfully at ZZZ with a total imbalance of 1;220 pounds with 8;370 pounds in the left wing; 7;150 pounds in the right wing and 13;470 pounds in the center tank - 29;000 points total. The aircraft was below max landing weight at touchdown. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) personnel were standing by as requested. After landing and before further taxi; ARFF personnel inspected the aircraft closely and reported no leaks; no visible damage; and no abnormalities.

My FO (First Officer) and I both discussed the hydraulic maintenance write ups from the previous day and saw no obvious irregularities. All ground activities were normal; I.e. engine start and taxi. FO was the pilot flying; I was the pilot monitoring. Climb to our cruise altitude of FL380 was uneventful. Approximately 40 minutes into flight we got the B system engine low pressure light; we used the QRH procedures for this malfunction which resulted in the switch being turned off. We checked the system page and saw that our fluid quantity was rising and stabilized at 106% and pressure was at approximately 2700 psi. The #2 oil filter bypass light came on; we again used the QRH which had us reduce thrust on the #2 engine to see if the light would extinguish. After moving the throttle to idle the light was still illuminated which; as per the checklist; required us to shut down the engine. Immediately prior to shutting down the engine I contacted Purser with our plan to secure the engine; our ETA to ZZZ1; and state that no cabin prep would be necessary. He told us that a deadheading pilot was onboard so we asked that he send him forward to the cockpit. Upon completion of the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist we advised ATC; got a more direct turn to ZZZ1; and descended to FL240. Once established at FL240 we saw that our closest divert airport was ZZZ2; we requested and received ATC clearance direct to the field. Our decision to proceed to ZZZ2 vs. ZZZ1 was passed on to Purser. We tried initially to contact Dispatch by sending a 'Call me' message from the ACARS. It took quite a while to get a response containing a frequency and I think the actual first response we got from Dispatch was that they had noticed that we had descended and wondered if we were having an issue. We did confirm that we had shut down an engine and once a decision had been made to go to ZZZ2 we confirmed that with Dispatch through ACARS messaging. We had good communication with Center but were never able to speak to Dispatch; though as we got close to ZZZ2 we did hear ZZZ3 ARINC; though they could never hear us. At about the same time Center notified us that our company was trying to contact us on the frequency that we had previously been given; we told them that they could not hear us so they relayed our final intentions to the company. I can only assume that our altitude might have played a role in this poor communication with Dispatch; though we had no issues with ATC. In the approximately 45 minutes of cruise prior to descent into ZZZ2; we discussed steps taken; checklist to be completed (One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist) and other considerations. As a result; I switched pilot flying and pilot monitoring duties. At approximately 60 miles from ZZZ2 we commenced our descent. With all checklists complete and planning for a flaps 15 approach to the ILS at ZZZ2; we were given an intercept heading and selected flaps 15 for landing. The flaps did not move; so we requested vectors across final while we troubleshot the flaps. At this time I assumed the duties of flying the aircraft and talking to ATC. [The other two pilots] took on the task of determining why the flaps did not extend. Shortly after; we checked our system page and discovered that we had zero B System hydraulic quantity; I do not recall the B system pressure. We decided to run the Loss of System B checklist which led us to electrically extend the flaps. After one more series of turns to intercept final; we fully configured and executed an uneventful approach and landing at ZZZ2.

I surmised that the crew rejected the takeoff and subsequently swapped out of the aircraft after returning to the gate and the aircraft was not flown afterwards. The corrective action was a check of the Takeoff Configuration Warning System with no faults noted. Since nothing was actually corrected; the Captain and I discussed the possibility of it activating again on our takeoff. We pushed late due to an unrelated finding of damage in the floor of the Forward Cargo Bin C. The bin was deferred and bags transferred to the aft bin. We were relatively full on this flight and our V1/VR speeds for Flaps 1 on Runway XXR were 125/135. The engine start and taxi out were uneventful with the throttle burst yielding no takeoff warning. On the takeoff roll at approximately 130 knot (5 knot after V1) the takeoff warning horn and light activated. We elected to continue the takeoff. The initial climb was normal and we discussed that we would be writing this up in ZZZ1. The Captain called for 'flaps up' at the appropriate speed and I moved the flap lever to UP. We had a few distractions from ATC due to hold-down altitude that was cancelled. Before I moved the landing gear handle to OFF; I checked the flap indicator and noticed that the flaps were still at 1 with the LE FLAP EXT green light illuminated. After confirming that the flap handle was up; I told the Captain the issue and that we need to keep our airspeed below 250 kts. and level off to handle the problem.After notifying ATC that we would need to level off; they gave us vectors for terrain while we ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree. Since the QRH doesn't really address the disagreement when attempting to RETRACT the flaps and only deals with setting the flaps for landing; we turned our attention to coordinating the air return. Dispatch was advised of the return as well as Station Ops in ZZZ. Our current gross weight was a little over 130;000 pounds so we extended the gear to add drag and burn off excess fuel for landing. The F/As (Flight Attendants) and passengers were notified of the return. Since this was a flight control issue; we [received priority handling] and notified ATC that we were requesting [Runway] XYL but would need time to reduce our landing weight to 128;000 pounds. We felt this was the safe option as time was not an issue. We then ran the QRH; ran the performance calculation for the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree QRH; and then the brake cooling module. The flaps extended normally with the Alternate Flap system to 15 degrees. The only slight issue was although I read the section directing the flap lever to be moved to the final flap position (15); we were sidetracked by discussing slowing during the extension and this was not done until after the QRH was completed. This allowed us to see our Flaps 15 maneuvering speed. After the delay vectors were complete and we were below the maximum landing weight; we made an uneventful landing on [Runway] XYL. Brake cooling allowed us to take right to the gate and the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) trucks followed. No other issues occurred. We swapped into another aircraft and continued the pairing.",,"The aircraft was an originator. The previous day a takeoff had been rejected because of a spurious Takeoff Config Warning and the maintenance resolution was no faults noted. The F/O (First Officer) and I discussed possible reasons for a false warning lasting a few seconds; which refreshed our memories of the warning system and thankfully prepared us for a repeat occurrence. We pushed late due to an unrelated finding of damage in the floor of the forward cargo bin. The bin was deferred and bags transferred to the aft bin. On takeoff; approximately two seconds after the F/O's V1 call; the configuration light illuminated and the warning horn sounded. The F/O called VR; and we lifted off. The light went out and the horn stopped about the time the wheels left the ground. The F/O's performance and adhering to procedure during this event was flawless; which combined with our earlier discussion allowed the situation to be handled easily. We briefly mentioned writing the issue up again in ZZZ1. I called for Flaps Up; from their takeoff '1' setting. F/O moved the flap lever to Up; and then moments later told me the flaps didn't go up; and instructed me not to go over 250 [kts.]. We were still at about 200 knots; so no airspeed issues. I told F/O to tell ATC we needed to level off and maintain low airspeed. Initially we told ATC we would follow the SID and get back to them. ATC gave us a terrain clearance altitude. We confirmed the flaps were not up. I called for the QRH and we agreed that 'Flap Disagree' was the appropriate checklist. The checklist starts off by saying 'to prepare for landing' so we paused the checklist; agreed we were not going to ZZZ1 with flaps out; and I messaged Dispatch we were returning to ZZZ; told ATC; and received clearance to return to ZZZ. I notified the F/A (Flight Attendants) and told the passengers we were returning to ZZZ. We ran the QRH for Flaps Disagree; the procedure went mostly uneventfully. We were at 130;000 pounds; so we took delaying vectors to burn fuel to 128;000 [lbs.]. We checked the brake cooling for Autobrake 3; no issues. We did [receive priority handling]. We landed Flaps 15 and taxied to the gate. Positive takeaways. The CQT training from (year)?; (year)? that emphasized flap malfunctions prepared us well to handle the stuck flaps. Negative takeaways. The QRH for Flap Disagree was obviously written with a failure occurring during approach in mind. For our situation of failure on takeoff; the procedure kept us with the flap handle up until we had returned to ZZZ and were preparing to land; which meant we had flaps out; but no maneuvering speed. We know that Flaps 1 speed is 180 knots approximately; but it would have been one more item in our favor if we had moved the flap handle to match the flaps to give us the normal sight picture on the displays. While we were extending the flaps with the alternate switch; between watching the flap gauge and calls from ATC; we momentarily missed the instruction in the QRH to move the flap handle with the flap movement. We followed proper flap speeds as flaps were extending; but that that was because of our experience; not the display. The QRH should have the instruction to move flap handle with flaps before the actual instruction to move the flaps so that crews can discuss the handle in advance. We ran the brake cooling for Autobrake 3; and then tried to run again for Autobrake 2. The brake cooling module did not work the second time. We recalled a recent (Company communication piece) about Dispatch doing something to mess up performance calculation results; which could be rectified by requesting landing data again; but that did not work. Something in the performance calculations needs to be corrected so that brake cooling can be run more than once. Brake cooling was not an issue; even with Autobrake 3; so this was a small nuisance.

Maintenance did a reset and signed off logbook as reset ok for service. FOs MAP was restored. Approximately 2 hours into flight and approximately 30 mins from ZZZZ1 enroute to ZZZZ; FOs MAP failed; followed by Captain's CWS (control wheel steering) fail; autothrottle failure; and SINGLE FMC operation message. Very shortly later; approximately 10 seconds; LNAV/ VNAV failed; both FMCs failed. Opposite autopilot selected; autopilot B. Captain's CWS was restored and one FMC was restored allowing for the engagement of LNAV/VNAV; and autothrottle was restored. FOs MAP still indicated a failure. Within approximately 60 seconds we had another dual FMC failure; followed by another LNAV/ VNAV failure; autothrottle failure; Captain's CWS failure. At this time with over two hours left to ZZZZ and navigating by raw data we decided it was the best course of action to divert to ZZZZ1 where the weather was favorable for landing with these navigational failures. We notified ZZZZ1 Center of our issues and intent to land in ZZZZ1. Around this time the Captain's FMC was restored automatically and we were once again able to navigate with LNAV/VNAV and the autothrottle and Captain's CWS was restored and autopilot was operational. As we neared ZZZZ1 we informed ATC of the need to hold to burn off fuel due to being overweight for landing which took approximately 10 minutes. The remainder of the flight was uneventful; we landed on Runway X and commenced the ILS approach in VFR conditions. The FOs MAP warning flag remained in view for the rest of the flight. My FO; Fas (Flight Attendants) did outstanding jobs. Great communication. ZZZZ1 ATC also very professional and helpful. In the 21 years I've been on the 737 both as an CA (Captain) and FO I've never experienced a dual FMC failure.

As the quantity continued to decrease; the Captain called dispatch and maintenance for any guidance or assistance they could give.  The tech told the Captain to follow the QRH.  The Captain and I began discussing engine shutdown and diversion scenarios. The oil level eventually fell to zero. Over a period of time; the oil pressure also began to fall slowly and we now were consulting the low oil pressure and engine shutdown procedures in the QRH.  In the descent to ZZZ airport ; the oil pressure dropped to where the QRH directs engine shutdown. We followed the engine shutdown checklist and [advised the TRACON]. We were vectored for a Visual approach to runway XX. When we transferred to ZZZ1 tower; we were cleared to land. A few miles from landing; ZZZ1 tower advised us that ZZZ2 tower reported possible missing cowlings from our engine. The Captain informed me that he was going to stop on the runway to find out if there was aircraft damage before proceeding to the gate. The landing and rollout were normal and we stopped the aircraft on the runway. After an inspection of the aircraft; the fire commander gave us the all clear to proceed to our gate with rescue personnel following. At the gate and after the jet bridge was brought to the aircraft; we were met by two mechanics. We briefed them on the situation and they went outside to investigate. Once they opened the cowls; I went down to find out if they had any idea what happened. I could see that the inner cowl was covered with oil on the inside; but there was no evidence of oil on the outside of the nacelle and only a little had dripped on the ground. I was told by one of the mechanics that they found an 'oil plug' in the bottom of the inside cowl when they opened the engine cowls.

The altitude deviation was a direct result of a malfunction of the stabilizer/stabilizer trim system. The other required category reports will be covered in a separate irregularity report.Approximately two hours after departure and level at FL350; the STAB OUT OF TRIM (amber) light illuminated. We ran the STABILIZER OUT OF TRIM QRH procedure. Autopilot B was engaged and remained engaged while the light was eliminated; the aircraft maintained altitude and airspeed in light mountain wave and light chop conditions. Since the auto pilot appeared to be trimming the aircraft normally and in accordance with QRH; we continued normal operation. We notified maintenance control and Dispatch via ACARS and made a maintenance logbook entry for the condition. Dispatch acknowledged receiving the message. The light remained illuminated for approximately 10 mins. During this time both the first officer and myself reviewed not only the QRH; but Stabilizer Trim Inoperative QRH procedure in the event that these stabilizers stopped trimming at some subsequent point. We also reviewed be available information in both the flight handbook as well as the systems handbook.The STAB OUT OF TRIM light continued to illuminate intermittently in durations that ranged from several minutes to just a few seconds. We also climbed to FL370 with no abnormal indications and with the B autopilot remaining engaged. I observed some movement of the trim wheel at various times.During the cruise portion of the flight; the light was extinguished most of the time; but we did have the intermittent illuminations periodically. We informed dispatch and maintenance control that the light was illuminating intermittently.On the arrival into ZZZ we were given several intermediate level offs as well as crossing altitude and airspeed restrictions all of which were met with autopilot B engaged.While being vectored around some weather; for a visual approach to Runway XXL; we were kept somewhat high on the profile and were in a fairly aggressive dissent to 4;000 feet.  Autopilot B remained engaged throughout this descent. At 4;000 feet the flight directors commanded a level off but the aircraft continued to descend below 4;000 feet and did not capture the altitude; the first officer (pilot flying) immediately disengaged the auto pilot and auto throttles and began to correct The flight path; but due to the out of trim condition of the stabilizer the aircraft descended to approximately 3;500 feet before being able to level off the aircraft with considerable back pressure on the yoke.We informed ZZZ Approach that we had a stabilizer issue and were attempting to correct back to 4000 feet. They directed us to maintain 3000 feet. At about this time; the first officer informed me that 'I don't have any trim' and I saw him activate the yoke stabilizer trim switches for nose up and nose down trim with no movement of the stabilizer trim wheels. I attempted to trim the stabilizer using the yoke switches on my side with no effect as well. The first officer was holding a great deal of back pressure on the yolk and stated 'I need nose up trim' at this point with his concurrence after having verified that neither yolk could trim the stabilizer electrically; I selected both stabilizer trim cut out switches to cut out.At this point I told the first officer that he was going to continue to be the pilot flying and also have the radios while I reviewed the QRH procedures. After I verified that we had accomplished all of the steps and had been directed to the next QRH section. Well I was reviewing the QRH procedures the first officer attempted to trim the aircraft manually and stated 'I can't move the wheel'. It was at this point I believe where I [requested priority] with approach and told them that we had a stabilizer trim failure and we were attempting to trim the aircraft manually we requested and receiveda vector to do this and we reported our souls on board as well as fuel and requested ARFF assistance at the airport. At this point I attempted to trim the stabilizer nose up manually from my side but was unable to turn the stabilizer trim wheel. I directed the first officer to attempt to slow the aircraft to clean maneuver speed in an attempt to unload the stabilizer so that we could trim the aircraft manually. At some point approaching clean maneuver speed I was able to begin moving the trim wheel nose up but it was still quite difficult and required a significant two-handed effort to move the wheel at all. I managed to get several turn nose up trim and the first officer said 'that's good'. At this point; we were in a more or less in trim condition at clean maneuver and clean. We continue to execute QRH and requested the longer Runway (XXR). It was at about this point I believe that I informed the flight attendants of our situation and that we would be landing in about 5 to 10 minutes; to expect a normal landing but that there would be fire trucks standing by.We completed QRH and had a normal flaps 15 landing on Runway XXRWe rolled out normally and cleared the runway and informed ground control and the ARFF captain that we did not require any further assistance.We taxi to the gate and shut down the aircraft; debriefed the flight attendants; and spoke with maintenance on the ground about our situation.",,"B737-900 flight crew reported Stab Trim failure resulted in an altitude overshoot and limited control ability.",

As I was looking out the window; the First Officer stated we had a #1 Engine failure. Tower asked if we wanted equipment. We asked if they saw smoke or damage; and they replied 'No'; along with another aircraft on the taxiway. I made a PA for everyone to remain seated. I then called the F/A's (Flight Attendants) and asked them to look at the Captain side engine for smoke or flames. They reported it looked normal. We ran the Engine Failure Checklist; and discussed running the Rejected Takeoff Checklist. Since the event happened as the aircraft had just started to roll (probably less than 10 knots) we didn't run the Rejected Takeoff Checklist; knowing that brake energy and cooling wouldn't be an issue.

At that point we heard a very loud bang followed by a hard left yawing motion. The PF (Pilot Flying) immediately retarded the throttles to idle; and applied smooth breaking; which brought us to a complete stop.  We were angled left by about 30-40 degrees in relation to the center line of Runway 4; just prior to taxiway. I immediately informed ATC that we had stopped on the runway; the PF informed the PAX (passengers) to stay seated.  At that point we began to assess the situation. Initially we thought it was a blown tire or nose wheel steering issue. In that moment of assessing I noticed the #1 Engine Fail Caution illuminate in the #1 EGT Gauge.

We reviewed the Rejected Takeoff Procedure; completed the QRH for Engine Failure. We then assessed the rolling and breaking capability of the aircraft and we found it to be normal.  We got clearance to exit the runway and return to the gate. As we pulled in to the gate; we remembered that we had not run an After Landing Checklist and quickly completed that; followed by the Parking Checklist. Then; the jetbridge malfunctioned and we had to wait until Airport Ops came to fix it. Once the jetbridge was attached I exited the aircraft to inspect Engine #1. I found the N1 fan blades and the stators directly behind them to be in a normal appearance. When I looked into the tailpipe of the turbine section; I found metal debris from the engine and both the aft fan blades and stators in front of them to be damaged and missing pieces. I hustled back to the Flight Deck to inform Ground Control that they needed to do a FOD check of the runway as we had; had and engine failure and that they needed to check for small engine parts.",,,,"First Officer reported engine failure on take off roll; resulting in engine damage and a return to the gate.",

Student Captain was Pilot flying for this leg. Shortly after Takeoff the PF commented that his electric trim switch was not working and asked me to try mine; which also did not work. I asked him if the elevator was working and he replied that it was and felt normal. We asked ATC to level off at 12;000 ft to work on a flight control issue and was approved. We did not ask for priority handling at this time...we engaged the A Autopilot successfully but shortly after the 'STAB OUT OF TRIM' light came on. As we began to look up the appropriate Non-normal; the PF disengaged the autopilot and tried to manually trim the stabilizer. Although he was successful it looked like it was difficult to rotate so I asked to give it a shot to feel the force required to rotate. The force required to rotate was abnormally high but did provide results and we were flying a trimmed aircraft at 240 knots. By now I was considering that a Jammed Flight Control (the stabilizer in this case) was the source of our STAB OUT OF TRIM  problem. So the first checklist we addressed was the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls Non-normal and also the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls procedure (the script/expanded explanation). Around this time we requested priority handling with ATC because checklist called for landing at nearest suitable airport. We were hoping that we might get electric trim back when moving STAB TRIM switch on pedestal to OVERRIDE. Did not happen. Called Dispatch with Maintenance Control on the line hoping for some systems expertise. Ended call with where we started. We began to discuss possible value of running STAB OUT OF TRIM checklist. We did. But before doing so we noted the hazard of running multiple checklists and capped our STAB TRIM OVERRIDE switch to normal. The Jammed Flight Control non normal resulted in moving both STAB  TRIM switches to CUTOUT but also called for landing at nearest suitable with Flaps 15. About this time we got on radio again with Maintenance Control; Dispatch and also the Flight Operations. Our hope was that Flight Operations might be able to get a Hydraulics of Flight Controls Maintenance expert on with us. We discussed both checklists and Flight Operations talked about the potential effect of slower speeds. This call ended with general consensus we were on the best track and we discussed whether to land sooner or burn down to below Max landing weight. Because we felt the aircraft was stable and our condition was not likely to get worse we chose to burn fuel. I talked to PF and told him it would be prudent for me to do landing since that would be his first one from left seat in aircraft. We briefed our arrival plan which included our trim plan as we reduced airspeed and extended gear and flaps. As we descended and slowed we reminded ATC of need for priority handling equipment. Only significant thing to report was that by the time we had fully configured and slowed to final approach speed it was extremely difficult to trim manually. In fact; with one pilot exerting maximum effort; you could maybe get the manual strection about a quarter turn. All of this led us to believe that the Stabilizer was DEFINITELY jammed. Landed uneventfully; had equipment check us out then taxied to gate. Flight Attendants were given TEST brief and told there was no need to prepare for evacuation.",,"All systems checked ok at gate; but after rotation we discovered our electric stabilizer trim was inop. The aircraft was controllable; but required moderate yoke pressure.We got vectors over the water and stopped our climb at 12;000. We engaged the autopilot momentarily; but the Stab out of Trim light led us to complete that non-normal checklist.We used the Manual Trim Procedure; but felt the force required was excessive; and the trim wheel was not rotating freely.Dispatch contacted and priority handling requested. We completed the Jammed Flight Control and the Stab Trim Inop checklists; both which call for Flaps 15 landing.After again contacting Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and Flight Operations; we planned to divert back to ZZZ.We burned down to max landing weight and landed uneventfully.",,"B737 NG flight crew reported a jammed horizontal stabilizer trim system and elected to make an Air turn Back and precautionary landing.",

We arrived in the flight deck and performed all the normal procedures we have for a normal push back. Captain did the preflight walk around and I loaded the FMC. We agreed the OFP (Operational Flight Plan) looked good and the rest of the flight plan looked sufficient for a potentially bumpy ride to ZZZ1. Captain advised to Flight Attendants to stay seated out of ZZZ until we knew the ride would allow for their safe duties. I was the flying pilot and after Captain did his first flight of the day and PM (Pilot Monitoring) duty brief; I briefed the SID. We planned for a normal pushback with 2 engine start for a quick taxi for departure. We performed the BEFORE TAKEOFF CHECKLIST on taxi out down the ramp for takeoff on runway XX.While we were taxiing down to runway XX; I noticed there was a split between the L and R duct pressure. I made note of it to Captain and we briefly discussed these splits we have seen before in this aircraft and recall it being a known normal occurrence. I cycled the L PACK (Left) switch to OFF and back to AUTO as well as the ISOLATION VALVE switch to OPEN and AUTO and saw the duct pressure needles sync together. We decided it would be a safe action to depart and noted we would keep an eye on the duct pressure and pressurization.We departed runway XX and CLIMBED VIA THE SID. I hand flew the departure to the mid 20s and then turned the autopilot on. I noted Captain mentioned 2 different times that the aircraft was pressurizing normally though the duct pressure still was split. The ride was mostly good and the flight attendants were up but the seat belt was still on. As we approached our level off altitude of FL340 the CABIN ALTITUDE horn and the MASTER WARNING lights illuminated. We verified the CABIN ALTITUDE was high on the pressurization panel and performed the Immediate Action items for CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING OR RAPID DEPRESSURIZATION/EMERGENCY DESCENT. The CABIN ALTITUDE was not controllable; and we continued with the descent. There was a definite issue with immediate communication over the inter-phone with the masks on and all the noise. Getting the mask on and the audio panel correct to be able to speak and hear over the speaker poses a threat in this airplane if not practiced. We were able to communicate with each other and ATC but it was challenging with all the noise and distractions.Captain identified as a priority flight with ZZZ Center and we began the initial descent over the mountains. I initially turned off the AUTOPILOT to pitch over and begin the procedure. Once we were established in a descent; I turned the AUTOPILOT back on and descended to FL190 with the high terrain in mind. We saw an aircraft below us on the TCAS and had to shallow the descent initially before we were cleared lower. Captain proceeded with completing the checklist and communicating with the Flight attendants; passengers; and dispatch. Descending through approximately 16;000 feet I noticed the CABIN ALTITUDE was in a normal range of around 7;000 feet and we took off the oxygen masks. We leveled off at 11000 in the vicinity of ZZZ2. Initially we were planning on diverting to ZZZ2 because we were so close; but Captain's experience and familiarity with ZZZ3. This led to the decision to divert and there was difficulty communicating with dispatch possibly due to our low altitude so we opted to landing in ZZZ3. The flight attendants and passengers were all briefed for the diversion to ZZZ3. I left the AUTOPILOT on and we flew the RNAV (GPS) Runway XY 29 approach and landing. All checklists were completed before ZZZZZ intersection and the landing was normal. CFR ( Aircraft Rescue & Firefighting) was there upon arrival.We were parked at the hard stand in ZZZ3 and the ramp personnel brought over the ramp to allow the passengers to vacate the aircraft. Operations were there to help while we figured out the plan of action for the passengers. Captain discussed the situation with the ChiefPilot; Dispatch; and Maintenance and I aided the flight attendants with passengers. I walked to the OUTFLOW VALVE and noted a mesh substance blocking the OUTFLOW VALVE from fully closing. Captain manually opened and closed the valve and I videoed the movement.",,,,"First Officer reported an emergency descent and diversion followed by a precautionary landing caused by Foreign Object Debris blocking the outflow valve from operation.",

Start; taxi and takeoff were uneventful.  Shortly after reaching cruise altitude of FL280; we noticed a low oil qty (0%) and dropping oil pressure (approximately psi). I called for QRH and Captain began running Low Oil Pressure Checklist.  While accomplishing the checklist; the oil pressure dropped below 15 psi and entered the Warning (Red) regime.  This drove us to shutdown the #1 engine.  Captain advised ATC and a gradual descent to FL 250 was initially begun.  After the shutdown was completed; we elected to begin diverting to ZZZ1 as it was only 50 miles away.  ATC; Flight Attendants and dispatch were all provided with necessary information to assist us as we requested Rwy XXL; but due to heavy traffic and closure of XXC; ATC requested we use XXR.  Landing data was run by both crew and dispatch and stopping distance was sufficient on the shorter runway.  While descending; I was momentarily distracted by the runway change and while simultaneously slowing to 200 kts Inattention caused us to slow to approximately 189 kts and we received an 'Airspeed Low' warning.  I accelerated back to 210 kts and requested Flaps 5.  We executed a normal approach and landing with 5 extra kts of speed due to a '10 kts of gain' on final report.  Once we landed; we exited the runway and requested Fire Chief to check us out.  After receiving the all clear; we taxied uneventfully to the gate and accomplished all checklists.

No answer. Ramp was able to obtain gate information from company and cleared us to gate. Fire truck followed us to gate and fireman came onboard and said all was clear outside of aircraft. Requested paramedics. Waited for over 15 minutes to arrive. FA 3 and several passengers were ill and required treatment. Informed that odor had completely subsided. Passengers remained onboard to allow access for paramedics as ill occupants were blocking front galley area and jetbridge. Flight Attendants were very assertive in communicating the specifics of the odors and location including the condition of our passengers throughout the event. This played a significant role in understanding the condition in the cabin and making proper decisions. Odor events can be difficult to prevent. Preparing for these seemingly inevitable challenges can make them easier to manage.",,"Climbing through FL240 on our way to our final FL280 we receive a call from the (FAs) flight attendants. The Captain took the call because I was responding to a frequency change to ATC. After checking in with Center I noticed the call with the FAs was taking longer than most so I decide to listen in. I overheard that the one of the flight attendants was reporting a weird smell in the back of the aircraft. After hearing a very brief snippet I pulled out my QRH and located fumes on page 17-2 just as a precautionary measure. The Captain returns from the call and informed me of what was taking place and that he was trying to receive more information from the FA's. During this time we had leveled at our cruise altitude of FL280; and our closest airport was ZZZ1. We decide to see what the weather was in ZZZ1. The weather was VFR conditions landing west. The FA calls back; I tell the Captain my aircraft; my radios so he can direct all this attention to the issue at hand. As he was talking to the FA's I overheard that they trying to figure out what the odor smells like. I look down and at the bottom of 17-2 is an odor/toxic substance checklist on 15-32. I flip to that page and hand the QRH to him. The Captain returned from the call and informed me that it smelt like a dirty sock/wet dog and that we have injuries on board; we are diverting to ZZZ1.  After that the Captain hands me back my QRH and starts the smoke/avionics smoke/ fumes QRC /QRH procedure. As we start descending I notice our aircraft gross weight was at 180;200 lbs and that we are going to be landing overweight so I turned my QRH to 15-22 over weight landing. After finishing the fumes QRC I hand the Captain my QRH so he can start that procedure. Shortly thereafter ATC asked what runway we would like and after making the landing calculation the Captain determined XXR would be the safest runway to land on. I put the ILS XXR in the box and sequenced it accordingly. After the Captain finished the overweight landing QRC; he resumed Pilot Flying duties; I resumed Pilot Monitoring duties and he asked for descent checklist as we were on a base leg for XXR. We were cleared the approach; we fully configured the aircraft; ran the before landing checklist. On short final I asked Tower to have safety vehicles standing by and that we were going to stop on the runway. The Captain landed the aircraft smoothly around 179;000 lbs; 148 knots and vertical speed around 100 ft a minute. We stopped on the runway; the Captain informed the passengers to remain seated three times. ARFF told us the aircraft looked fine and we taxied to the gate. Reporter suggested Airbus needs to determine what causes these mysterious 'dirty sock' fume events and provide a fix.",,"A321 flight crew reported a "dirty sock" odor was detected in the cabin during cruise resulting in a diversion.",

Was cleared to descend via ZZZZZ 2 RNAV arrival on [Runway] XXR. Prior to ZZZZZ; at approximately FL220 during descent; noticed that the cabin altitude was at 8;300 feet and increasing. I called attention to the First Officer that we might be losing cabin pressurization. The Pressurization screen on ECAM was displayed and noticed that both the inlet and extract valve were fully closed but the safety valve had opened.Since we had already been cleared to descend via ZZZZZ arrival and had an altitude of 12;000 set in the MCP I decided to expedite the descent to see if I could control the rate of ascent in the cabin. At approximately FL180 it appeared that we could not control the rate of ascent in the cabin and that at its present rate the cabin would exceed 10;000 feet shortly. I then [advised] with ATC and requested 10;000 feet which was granted. I advised the Lead Flight Attendant that we were experiencing cabin pressurization problems but to expect a normal landing. As we leveled at 10;000 feet I monitored the cabin and noticed that it had climbed to 12;000 feet but stabilized. It took several minutes before the cabin normalized at our cruise altitude of 10;000 feet. I asked the First Officer  to see if he could find an applicable checklist to run. During this time I maintained control of the aircraft and communicated with ATC. The First Officer advised that he was able to manually control the outflow valve and that the checklist recommended shallow descents thereafter. I continued to ask for delayed vectors from ATC just north of ZZZ as the First Officer and I reviewed the state of the aircraft and decided it was safe to proceed with the landing. I asked ATC for shallow descents on the arrival to [Runway] XXR into ZZZ. The landing and taxi in were uneventful.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported malfunctioning pressurization system on descent.",

Flight was completely full in the cabin. Due to Pack #2 being inoperative it was difficult to cool the main cabin temp using only Pack #1. Using only Pack #1 at FL370 we were able to maintain 72 degrees in the cabin using max cold and high flow. Approximately 200 nm west of ZZZ at FL370 we received an ECAM AIR PACK 1+2 FAULT. ATC was notified and [priority handling was requested]. Upon checking the pressurization and bleed air page; it appeared that Pack #1 was overheating showing an output temperature in amber yet we never received a Pack 1 OVHT ECAM. The cabin altitude was still under control. A descent to 10;000 ft. was initiated without exceeding the cabin altitude before we complied with the ECAM to turn off Pack #1 leaving us unpressurized. Contact was made with Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss the situation resulting in a diversion to ZZZ.",,"Approximately 240 nm from ZZZ; at a cruise altitude of FL350 and while in communication with Center; an ECAM aural and Master Caution sounded for AIR PACK 1+2 FAULT. The CA (Captain) said he noted a momentary amber overheat temp in Pack 1; but it did not trigger the PACK 1 OVHT caution. I (Pilot Monitoring) did not see this indication that had subsequently returned to a green inlet temperature. Pack 2 was previously secured and turned off per the MEL deferral on our 2nd release. Pack 1 showed a fault light. The AIR PACK 1+2 FAULT ECAM directed us to secure Pack 1; descend to 10;000 ft. MSL or MEA and then turn on the RAM Air when the pressure differential was less than 1.0. Even though Pack 1 had a fault light in the overhead panel; it appeared to be partially functioning; the cabin pressure holding and the cabin altimeter only increasing at a very slight rate. A flight crew decision was made to begin an immediate normal descent to 10;000 ft. without the use of oxygen while closely monitoring the pressurization page to ascertain the true nature of the Pack 1 malfunction. The CA directed me to assume pilot flying duties and ATC responsibilities while he coordinated with Operations; Dispatch; flight attendants and the passengers. We began a coordinated 1500-2000 fpm rate of descent via two ATC-assigned step down altitudes of FL300 and FL200 before ultimately reaching 10;000 ft. The aircraft was lowered in a steady continual descent with no pauses which I believe helped our situation. Cabin pressure held steady around 8;000 ft. during the normal descent. Upon reaching 10;000 ft.; Pack 1 was secured; differential pressure reached less than 1.0; RAM AIR was selected on and the cabin altimeter climbed from approximately 8;000 to 10;000 ft. as expected. We completed all remaining ECAM items until the screens were normal. The rate of fuel burn at 10;000 ft. MSL made reaching our initial destination of ZZZ1 impossible; and it was decided that ZZZ was a suitable diversion while 200nm away and with 11;600 pounds of fuel aboard along with the best Maintenance; aircraft and passenger accommodation options. We informed ATC; Dispatch; Operations; and proceeded accordingly. We switched to the next Center and the Captain [requested priority handling] and returned to the pilot flying role while we coordinated an uneventful arrival via the ZZZZZ to Visual XX approach at ZZZ and ultimately parking at gate XY. We were then met by the ZZZ Chief Pilot at the gate and proceeded to fill out a risk mitigation form following the event. We then accepted a new aircraft and release at gate XZ and ultimately brought the same passengers to ZZZ1 two hours later than originally planned.In totality; I felt the event was handled safely and professionally. The CRM skills taught and utilized allowed both the CA and First Officer to properly divide duties while ensuring sufficient cross checks and communication. At no time did I feel rushed or stressed. I believe the deliberate delay in securing the faulty Pack 1 that appeared to be functioning along with the continual scanning of the pressurization page allowed us to avoid an unnecessary priority descent; use of pilot oxygen; or the deployment of passenger oxygen that might have accompanied a rapid depressurization. All in all; I felt the CA was composed and handled the event in line with Company desires. While I regret the delay the passengers experienced; I believe we handled the event in a safe and caring manner.",,"Air Carrier Pilot Crew reported departing with one air cycle machine inoperative and during cruise flight the other air cycle machine indicated a fault condition necessitating a diversion.",

Inbound to ZZZ; deviating west of the arrival due to a severe TS over ZZZZZ and also another TS touching ZZZZZ1 along with multiple significant CB radar returns just west of our direct line to ZZZZZ1.  We checked in with ZZZ Center and descended to or level at FL340. We were made aware that our deviation west of the arrival was causing the Controller difficulty in de-conflicting our descent due to departing traffic which was below us and to my understanding west of us.  Very busy controller with no time to discuss options.  I was approaching the west edge (absolutely as close as possible) of the last significant CB when the Controller told us in an excited tone to turn right 15 degrees and descent to FL280 (or maybe 240; I don't recall now).  The CB was about 4 mile ahead and 2 miles across in both directions and 15 degrees right would put us straight through the middle of it.  I started an immediate right and tried to ask my First Officer to tell the Controller we had to have farther right; but he saw me turning and read back the 15 degree instruction.  The Controller was immediately on to two or three other calls.  I asked my First Officer to tell the Controller the heading that we needed to fly and about then the Controller noticed that we had turned a bit extra and shouted at us because apparently another aircraft was departing in the corridor between the last CB and the big TS.  I immediately corrected back and flew through the middle of the CB I was trying to avoid which was where the Controller wanted us in the first place.  I also paused my descent very briefly to verify with the Controller that we were going to be safe still and we agreed on a heading of north as we passed directly through the cell.  Fortunately; despite passing though the small cell with a solid yellow return; there was no significant turbulence and no injuries.  I don't believe we caused loss of separation and my intention was to coordinate and return to the desired heading as soon as possible. The frequency was too busy; departures probably should have been pushed farther west; I was trying to comply with the Controller's guidance as best I could while not creating a dangerous turbulence situation for my flight attendants and passengers.  The B737-8 MAX radar might be overly sensitive.  Had the Controller asked 30 seconds sooner we would have had time to coordinate; or a minute later we could have taken any heading.  In retrospect; we should have said we were unable to turn for another 6 miles; but given the urgency in the Controller's voice; I thought I was doing the right thing.Whenever an airplane is cleared to deviate for weather and is operating around thunderstorms and significant CBs; it seems like the Controller should always ask if you can accept a turn; not just assign a heading into the direction of the things we are avoiding.  Also; if there is any way to make these frequencies less congested; that would help also.  And finally; the other company's aircraft was apparently flying outbound and closer to our assigned arrival than we were comfortable with flying inbound.  Maybe ZZZ Center should develop and publish alternate Departure and Arrivals that could be assigned for weather avoidance as widespread thunderstorms are so common in this area.",,,,"Air carrier First Officer reported a weather deviation was required but the very busy ATC controller was unable to accommodate the request.

As soon as the turn was initiated a loud bang was heard from below and behind the cockpit. The noise then went away. A few moments later FA (Flight Attendant) 1 called up and reported a loud banging noise from 2R. There were no ECAM or any other indications in the cockpit - all displays were normal - nor was the noise audible from the cockpit. After getting the airplane stabilized and the after-takeoff checks completed; I sent the FO (First Officer) back to investigate. It was confirmed that a loud banging was obvious in the cabin. A return to the field was planned; ATC notified; [priority handling was requested]; FA's briefed for a precautionary landing; Dispatch notified and CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) requested. Runway XY was requested as this was an overweight landing; and the QRH procedure was followed. A smooth landing followed; the aircraft was brought to a stop after clearing Runway XY and the airplane inspected by CFR crew. The comment was that; 'A door was missing.' No other damage noted; and the flight taxied to a gate uneventfully. A walk-around revealed the 2R slide door departed the aircraft; followed by the slide. The noise was from the inflation supply line which was banging against the fuselage and wing root. A write-up for the missing door and raft was entered into the log along with the overweight landing notes. [The cause can be found through] perhaps confirmation of all maintenance items accomplished during the inspection at ZZZ immediately previous to this event. [I suggest to find the] determination of why the slide/raft door failed and [to find] appropriate remedies [to be] taken to preclude future issues.",,"I was assigned FO (First Officer) on [the] flight. I arrived at aircraft and the Captain was already at the aircraft. I performed the preflight walk-around and noted no issues. All checks for preflight were normal. We were cleared for takeoff on Runway XXL; initial climb to 5000 and heading 290. Takeoff was normal. The Captain called for AP (Autopilot) on and pulled heading at turn altitude. Climb power reduction and clean-up was normal. We were handed off to Departure and checked in. Departure gave us a climb to 7;000 and 360 heading. I confirmed 7;000 with ATC and the Captain set 7;000 and I confirmed it. As he turned the heading knob to 360; a loud bang was heard from behind the flight deck. The #1 FA (Flight Attendant) called and reported the bang and a clunking noise near 2R door. No ECAM or warnings were displayed.The Captain retained the aircraft; leveled at 16;000 as cleared; and set speed to 245. We completed all checks and asked ATC to remain at 16000 as we needed to check out something. They approved that and asked if we were [requesting priority handling]. We replied not at this time; but we will need to check some things. The Captain then asked if I was OK with going back and checking things out as the sound could not be heard on the flight deck. The FA came forward and I went to the cabin and inspected the area and heard the banging she described. I returned to the flight deck; described what I heard and what I felt was happening and suggested that we return. The Captain agreed and formulated a return plan. He completed all notifications [and] reviewed all procedures with me. We [requested priority handling] and returned to base for an overweight landing.The Captain performed the landing as per QRH procedures. He brought the aircraft to a stop on the taxiway as CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) could inspect the aircraft; and they informed us that there was a door open and everything else looked OK. We taxied to the gate; followed shutdown procedures; and then went down to inspect the aircraft. At that time; we found that the 2R slide door and slide were missing and the inflation hose was hanging down and had struck the fuselage. The Captain the entered entries in the AML for the damage and overweight landing.My concern is that when we checked the system pages to see if we had any systems issues; there were none indicated. The doors page showed all the slides green and the white 'slide' indications. I.e.; normal armed condition. Had the green box that indicated the 2R slide shown amber; we would have been alerted that the door was in fact open - in this case gone - and would have had a better idea of what we were dealing with.",,"A321 flight crew reported a loud bang followed by repetitive banging aft of the cockpit door and elected to perform an air turnback where it was discovered that a slide and slide door had departed the aircraft.",

Initially; we considered a landing gear tire might have blown or it was retraction problem due to gear in transit timed with [another] problem. Once gear was fully retracted; a series of bangs and shutters occurred again and during our global assessment (Nothing displayed on ECAM); we noted a spike in temperature on engine 1 EGT as corresponding to the problem. [We suspected] compressor stalls. Reducing the power on engine 1 to idle eliminated the problem and the engine ran normally. We immediately [requested priority handling] with ATC requesting the ARFF equipment; as well as a box pattern back to XXR (longest runway); leveled at 4000 feet MSL; maintained configuration at 180 knots. We ran all appropriate checklists including: Engine 1 Stall in flight with Engine Parameters Normal at Idle; Non-Routine Landing; and Overweight Landing. We made an initial and landing imminent announcement to the flight attendants and passengers. During the initial series of compressor stalls and after the engine was stabilized at idle neither the flight attendants nor any passengers reported any other engine problems such as fire; smoke; vibrations; etc. Once everything was complete we flew the ILS XXC approach to a normal touchdown and landed to a full stop on the runway so that ARFF could look over the aircraft before we taxied uneventfully to the gate. Weight at touchdown was 3;000 to 4;000 pounds over the max with a 200 FPM touchdown. After shutdown; we made 2 logbook entries (Compressor stall after TO and Overweight Landing). We debriefed the Chief Pilot; Maintenance; ARFF Chief; Gate Agent; and Passengers. We saved all paper work; photos; and contact information.An Airbus Pilot jump-seater was very helpful with event CRM. Possible failure factors included heavy weight; TOGA takeoff; and a warm day stressing the engine. In addition; APU had been on MEL for 8 days adding to engine fatigue and stress with ground air and cross-bleed starts; and it was the aircraft's first flight of the day (even with ample warm-up time). Following policies; procedures; flows; and checklists all while maintaining positive aircraft control in an un-rushed manner using all available resources and thorough CRM led to a safe resolution to the engine failure on takeoff. [I recommend] better and more prompt APU maintenance; and the use of non-TOGA flex takeoffs on longer runways in hot and heavy takeoffs situations.",,"Shortly after takeoff; during gear retraction; we noticed a loud thud or two. Initially; I thought it was a problem with landing gear retraction; since it started while the gear was still in transit. Shortly thereafter; the noise occurred again. A spike in engine temp was noted during the sounds; and the spike immediately disappeared. The EGT over-temp readings were happening too fast (and clearing so fast) that no ECAM message was triggered long enough to stay up. Once power on the #1 engine was reduced; the engine ran normally at idle. We requested priority handling and leveled off at 4;000 feet. ATC began vectoring us back for a visual approach to the longest runway; XXC. We requested ARFF to inspect the plane on landing. Flight attendants; passengers and Dispatch were advised of the situation and our intentions. All appropriate QRH procedures were complied with. Non-normal landing procedures were complied with. Overweight landing procedures and landing distance assessment were completed. A straight-out heading was requested and approved in the event of a missed. An uneventful approach and landing was conducted. After stopping on the runway; we requested ARFF to inspect the #1 engine for damage. No damage was noted and we continued to the gate. I'm not sure that this event was preventable. The only unusual thing about this aircraft was the deferral period for the APU. I think it had been deferred 8 days ago; which is quite a lot of external air start cycles and cross bleeds. Just speculation; but if this malfunction was associated in some way with a bleed air valve; the fact that the APU was deferred so long-and all the associated unusual starting procedures (perhaps external air starts) could have been a factor. It might be something to consider from a maintenance tracking perspective. I hear that we are seeing more inflight engine problems lately. I think APU deferrals should be as short as possible for a variety of reasons.I have a feeling that this event may have been associated with the APU deferral. I think emphasis should be put on deferring them for a shorter time and routing planes in need of APU work to a Maintenance facility sooner. In no case is a week deferral reasonable or necessary. (I don't think any troubleshooting had even been attempted to get the APU operating again.)

During this phase my symptoms were the following: burning eyes; nose and throat. Flight deck was notified. After deplaning the fumes and my symptoms dissipated. Maintenance came on board and decided we would continue our next flight with same aircraft. On Aircraft X ZZZ to ZZZ1 during boarding when engines were turned on I immediately detected the oily burning fumes that were now at a Level 3: Strong since customers began to complain as well. The location started initially in the AFT of the aircraft but during deplaning was detectable throughout entire aircraft. The source was the same which was the air vents. The phase was during boarding on the ground. Flight deck was notified and they determined we had to deplane all customers. Myself and F4 were experiencing more severe symptoms. I experienced symptoms of burning eyes; nose and throat once again. I also began to feel tightness in my chest; difficulty breathing; thickness in the air; slight disoriented; and minor speech problems.

As pilot flying; my attention was completely absorbed with flying the aircraft with assumed degraded performance and didn't allow for transfer of aircraft control. Additionally; lack of experience on the fleet and as a new Captain also played a significant role. Departing over max landing weight with no APU was probably not a good decision. Additionally; I think a max weight takeoff V1 cut should be added to our training.

A few seconds later another call from the flight attendant said the cabin now has the strong odor and a passenger said there is a haze. We notified ATC and were cleared direct to ZZZ. We had a thunderstorm between us and the field; so this required some deviations. We elected not to don the mask because we didn't have smoke or odor in the cockpit. We briefly talked about it and didn't want the added condition. We also decided that we would don the mask at first sign of smell or smoke. Things obviously were very busy because we made it from 36;000 [feet] to the Runway in 18 minutes. By the time we were pointed in the right direction we started to run the Smoke Fire Fumes Checklist but never finished it. We were very tired from the multiple reroutes; PM trip to an AM; back to a PM. I elected not to finish the checklist because I wanted all eyes up so we could get the aircraft on the ground safely.

Considering the seriousness of the issue and our #1 priority of Safety; we immediately [requested priority handling] with ATC and received direct ZZZ.

We continued to get updates from the Flight Attendants/Dispatch/ATC and kept them in the loop of our emergency diversion into ZZZ. The Captain continued to deviate around thunderstorms and turbulence while I adjusted the route in the FMC; loaded the approach and got weather and landing information. We quickly discussed our arrival with overweight landing; minimum braking; and plan for fire trucks to meet us. We ran the Descent/Arrival Checklists and just started the Smoke/Fire/Fumes Checklist when; as we were now very near the airport; the Captain requested we stop the checklist as he needed me heads up with him and our focus to get the aircraft quickly on the ground.

I was on standby from XA:00am-XG:00 on Date in ZZZ. Crew Scheduling called me at XF:06 to work a 1-2-1 three day trip. They assigned me position 1 and the first leg of the trip was to ZZZ1. I switched positions with Name and became the #3 because I don't like being #1. While walking to the gate flight service called to check on us (they thought they were calling the #1 from the original crew but instead called me by accident) and informed me that the original crew was being taken off this trip due to a fume event. When we arrived at the gate; our flight had begun deplaning. We were told that they had sat out on the tarmac for 2 hours before they were able to get to the gate and deplane so the aircraft could be checked out. During deplaning; Name 1 (the #4) and Name 2 (the #2) called the union and Name 3 to talk to them because we were very nervous about flying on this aircraft after it just came back to the gate and had to have us re-crew it due to a fume event. We did not know the original crew personally but as they deplaned they warned Name 2 and Name 1 that we should not get on that aircraft because something was wrong with it and that they were on the way to the hospital. They were shaken up; pale; and were visibly ill. One of the girls even had to get a wheelchair to wheel her out of the terminal. I immediately felt very unsafe about proceeding forward on this trip. Seeing the crew so visibly ill from a fume event and then being expected to take that aircraft right back out and move on like nothing happened is extremely terrifying and irresponsible of the flight deck. Our health and safety clearly was not a first priority in this instance. After original crew and passengers deplaned we were immediately sent down to the aircraft and the agent wanted us to check our equipment so we could board again and get this flight out as quickly as possible since it was so delayed. I was the first FA on the jet bridge; and I ran into the maintenance man on his way out. He told me he did an inspection of the aircraft and it was cleared to fly. He said he could smell stuff in the aft lavs but that everything was clear. He told Name 2 when he saw her that it was all good and to not get on and break anything. This was all happening so fast that it was hard to process it all and I was very uneasy and felt pressure to work this flight. After I got on the flight; the Captain was dismissive of the event. He informed me that he thought the previous crew was being overly cautious because two of the four flight attendants had just recently been through an incident on one of their trips that they had not been able to fully recover from; so that is why they turned around; but he did not think there was a serious issue to be concerned with. I interpreted this as the Captain thinking the previous crew was overreacting and that he did not take their concerns seriously. He and the First Officer said they attributed the fumes to there being a lot of aircraft congestion on the way out and that they thought it would be fine this time around. They said to let them know if we experienced anything this time; but it seemed as though the flight was going no matter what based on the flight deck's attitude. They continued to dismiss our fears before boarding started again saying it was fine to fly on this aircraft and that maintenance didn't see a problem. I was hesitant with this news because maintenance was on their way out not even 5-10 minutes after deplaning took place; and I did not think that was a substantial amount of time to do a thorough check of the aircraft. After the Captain informed me of this; my other crew members got on board and they asked me what he said. Name 2 was especially nervous because she has a health concern that if mixed with a fume event could be life threatening; so she went into the cockpit and had a long talk with the Captain. I'm not exactly sureof what he said to her because I was out of earshot but she told me he was dismissive and also mentioned what he said to me about the other 2 flight attendants from the other crew being overly cautious due to their past experiences on a trip. Name 2 told me that the Captain also made a joke when she expressed her concerns about how his mother thought he was the smartest guy in the world but there is always a chance that I'm wrong. We re-boarded passengers on the flight without there being a substantial amount of time to pass after it was deplaned the first time (like 15-20 minutes). During boarding; passengers kept asking me if it was safe to fly; and I told them that the Captain had told me he thought it was due to congestion from other aircraft that caused the smell the first time and that maintenance had cleared us to fly. The Captain never once made an announcement to the passengers to update them on the situation and reassure passengers once they re-boarded. Name 1 called Name 3 during boarding and asked Name 1 to ask the Captain if he had filled out the cabin odor fume report. Name 1 called me since he was in the back to ask. Name 2 had come to the front during boarding and she ended up being the one to ask the Captain. The Captain's response was that he had never heard of the cabin odor fume report before. There was another report that the union wanted us to ask about (the report is named with numerics) and when Name 2 asked the Captain about this he said he was going to pull it up but we never actually saw him do it. He then changed the subject with Name 2 to talk about his vacation that he was going on at the end of the trip. I had COVID back in Month and ever since I recovered; my taste and smell have not returned; so I am not a good judge on if there was an odor in this aircraft. However; Name 1 and Name 2 mentioned they smelled something gross in the back of the aircraft. Once in the air; Name 1 and I started feeling very light headed. Name 1 and the #1 Name 2 also started having a bad headache. During the middle of the service; there was moderate turbulence that continued the duration of the flight. We ended up having to suspend service because it was too dangerous to be in the aisle. I even felt like I caught some air at one point. We hurried to secure the carts and ourselves in the back. This is not what this report is about; but I think you should know that the Captain did not communicate with us the entire time about the turbulence or when it would end. We had to call him to ask if the turbulence would continue the rest of the flight and if there was a different altitude we could try because we were all feeling whiplashed in the back and queasy. He said we should suspend service and that he would make the announcement to the passengers about it. Name 1 then had to call him about 15 minutes later after the initial call to see if he was still going to make the announcement because he had yet to do it. He finally made the announcement to the passengers that we would not be completing the rest of the service due to the turbulence. However; he called the #1 Name 2 to make sure she had completed first class service because he wanted to make sure the customers were getting what they paid for. The Captain's unprofessionalism and lack of care for the flight attendants and our safety was astounding. Once we landed he and the First Officer were one of the first ones off the aircraft and they left to go straight to the van for their layover. These pilots ran off right when we landed. It was evident that the Captain was in a hurry to start his layover and had no concern for health and safety of his flight crew. He never once checked on us or asked us how we were feeling from the fume event or the turbulence. Now you have at least two flight attendant crews sick and a Captain and First Officer that could care less. Was this airplane truly airworthy? Name 1's headache continued for the next 3 days. On the second day of ourtrip; after we worked from ZZZ1-ZZZ2 Name 1 had to call out because he threw up mid flight; had a horrible headache; and had an upset stomach. He said his symptoms started that first flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1 and only continued. We had to get a standby from ZZZ2 to finish the trip with us. I have felt extremely lethargic ever since that flight. It feels like I took 10 Benadryl. I have had a very foggy brain and have slept non-stop. Writing this report is the longest I have stayed awake since I got home from that trip. I have also had shortness of breath. Name 1 and I went to the ER on Date 3 and got our hemoglobin levels tested and our chest x-rayed. Our hemoglobin levels were normal but that is to be expected since we went 48 hours after exposure. We called out on flight because we felt so sick and unable to fly. I talked to nurse when I called the number and after describing my symptoms she told me she was going to have me stop right there and recommend that I go get checked out at the ER and call her back within the next few days after I was checked out. I am still experiencing extreme brain fog; exhaustion; and shortness of breath. At the end of the day; we felt forced to get on an aircraft that had an issue and work Aircraft X to ZZZ1 because the union told one of the other flight attendants if we didn't we would get in trouble with the company and a refusal to fly. We have been given points against us when we were injured on the workplace in a fume event of some sort and now we are having our jobs jeopardized by points. The points are penalizing us for being sick and being taken to the hospital on a work injury/fume event. Why would a company that I give my time to penalize us for a work related injury? I want to recap that you have 2 crews that are sick with a Captain who was absolutely unprofessional; unsafe; and dismissive. This is a serious safety issue; and with this aircraft still flying you are risking the safety and health of passengers and crew members. Train your pilots and ground staff (the Tower and Ops) on how to handle fume events. We should have never taken this aircraft after knowing that 4 flight attendants were taken to the hospital sick and now we are all sick. At the end of the day; this flight deck crew and the company is responsible for our illnesses. I have not received any calls from our department. It is like no one cares how sick we are. This is my first fume event and I have had no guidance on how to handle this and proceed from here. Communication is key.",,"I was on standby on Date at XA:00 sign in & was called at XE:15 to work the flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. I was assigned position 4 on the trip with 3 other crew members. I made my way to the gate & as I arrived there were still passengers getting off the aircraft. I went over to the side & started talking to the crew that I was going to be working with. We saw the other crew come off & they did not look okay; the crew came over to us & said that the airplane had just had a fume event & that it wasn't safe for us to fly. We continued down the jet bridge after scanning in with the agent; upon arrival to the aircraft I saw that Maintenance was on board & talking to the Captain. As we got on we asked the Captain what had happened & if the airplane was safe to fly. He began to say that the other crew was just smelling fumes from the congestion on the taxi way & that it was nothing to be worried about. As I got to the back of the aircraft I smelt a terrible pee smell which seemed to be coming from the aft lavatory's. I informed the Captain but he said he was aware of the situation in the back. Our number 2 made sure to go up front & ask a bunch of different questions to the Captain about the aircraft & what had just happened. The Captain didn't give us much information with the plane & so I called the union. As I called the union; I was told to ask for a cabin air quality check; upon asking the Captain for this he said it was not necessary & that he wasn't needing one done. We tried our best with not feeling safe going on this aircraft; we boarded up & began pushing back. Upon push back; I was informed that 3 of the 4 flight attendants on that flight before us were headed to the hospital & one had to be wheeled out in a wheelchair. We were already taxing & there was nothing we could do at this point. We got up in the air & I started to have a terrible headache; later in the flight the number one came to the back & said that she was having a headache as well. We thought nothing of it for the most part; we then began to all feel light headed. We continued onto ZZZ1. The headaches continued onto the next day when we were working our flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. About 30-45 away from landing I began to feel super nauseous from the flight & ended up getting sick on the flight. I proceeded to call the Captain to call tracking & have a standby waiting at the gate for me because I wanted to get off of the trip because I started feeling so sick. I got off the trip went to my hotel & slept for 12 hours before waking up. I was foggy & very out of it; very unlike me in any way. I still had my headache even after I had taken my medicine that I had been given by a doctor a while back for pain. The headache continued through the night & I was deadheading on a flight the next day; I was very very exhausted & short on my breath. I got on the plane not thinking much about it. As we were in the air I started to feel light headed; like I was going to pass out once again. Upon landing I got a message from the other crew informing me that 2 of the 4 had been in the ER still. One of the flight attendants did test positive for carbon monoxide poison. I proceeded to call the injury number and report everything to them. I was informed that I needed to go to the hospital & get checked out. Me & the number 3 flight attendant ended up going to the hospital together to get checked out; all of our tests came back normal but the doctor said that was to be expected since it was so long after exposure. He said there was a very good chance that is what it was but the test didn't show it. He gave us a note & recommended us stay rested & healthy. I don't believe that I should be punished with points for the company's inability to properly check the aircraft & deem it not safe. I should not be receiving any points for the situation as it was an injury on duty & was reported to the company in a timely manner. The points should not count against us in this event since it was a fume event. The points are given to us for being proactive about our safety & well being; Why would a company that I work for & give most of my time; want to give us points for a situation we believe is linked to an unsafe aircraft. We now have 2 crews who have been sick & however many after the fact. You have a Captain who was not in charge enough to say he wanted an air quality check of the aircraft for the safety of his crew & passengers. You still have this aircraft in service & are potentially putting other people's life & health at risk. Pilot & airplane need to be taken out of service for endangering passengers & crew members.",,"Air Carrier Flight Attendant crew reported a fume event during flight which resulted in physiological symptoms.",

The First Officer and I scanned the flight deck for unreliable airspeed; fire warnings and any possible pressurization problems. We were in agreement that none were present and could not locate the source of the warnings; I elected to disengage the autopilot and auto throttles; to verify control of the aircraft. The First Officer and I searched again for any indication of fire or airspeed issues. We found none. With the fire bell still sounding we elected to return to ZZZ and request priority.   ATC was notified and vectors given back to Runway XX. Having just departed and well over the gross landing weight; we planned the longest runway available.  I notified the A Flight Attendant; to prepare the cabin for landing and that we had about 10 minutes to touchdown.The First Officer computed the landing data and a visual approach was planned. Landing weight was XXX;000 pounds; and the Ref Speed 1XX. ATC provided vectors to a base leg and we were cleared for the visual approach. The landing and rollout were normal and I elected to let the aircraft roll to the end and turnoff; stop the aircraft and allow CFR to inspect for fire. As soon as I stopped the aircraft; I made a PA to the Flight Attendants and Passengers to remain seated. Ground was contacted and we spoke directly with fire command. No evidence of fire was found to exist. The First Officer computed the brake cooling module for and potential issues that would prevent us from parking at the gate or cooling required. None were found. Coordination with ZZZ Operations as to our situation and a gate was completed and we taxied to gate X. At the gate we were met by the Fire Crew; ZZZ Maintenance and Ground Operations.  The warnings continued to sound and were not able to be silenced by Maintenance Personnel. I made two logbook entries for the discrepancies and the overweight landing and gave a debrief of the event to the Maintenance Personnel. Dispatch was contacted and informed of the situation and we agreed to talk later as my main focus was still dealing with passengers and Ground Ops. After passenger deplaning; the aircraft was handed over to maintenance and the First Officer and I went to the Crew lounge; where we contacted Dispatch and conducted a debrief of the events with the Chief Pilot.",,"This event occurred while departing ZZZ from Runway XX; climbing out on the ZZZZZ Departure at about 7;000 feet. I was the PM; and had just completed the final flap retraction and a radio hand off to ZZZ Departure. All of a sudden; numerous alarms/warnings sounded on the flight deck and were extremely loud. The PF stayed focused on flying the aircraft in the high density environment. I quickly started to scan all of the panels; Master Caution and Warning indications; pressurization panel; cargo fire panel; fire handles; flight instrumentation; airspeed; AOA; and standby indicators. There were NO indications of any light or malfunction anywhere on the flight deck and all aircraft flight parameters seemed normal.The Captain made the decision to advise ATC and return to ZZZ; on Runway XX. Meanwhile all aural alarms continued to sound very loudly which made communication difficult. We discussed the situation. We had just about every major aural alarm sounding at once; with the exception of wind shear. With no other indications presently indicating any kind of system malfunction; we concluded the best option would be to get the aircraft on the ground. This would be an overweight landing by about XX;000 pounds; on a long runway in day VMC conditions. The Captain coordinated with the cabin and operations. We computed landing data; briefed; and ran checklists. We were cleared a visual approach and the Captain completed an excellent uneventful landing to Runway XX. We cleared the runway at the end. I coordinated with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue equipment) and requested them to thoroughly evaluate the aircraft for any fire/smoke issues. I also ran the numbers for any brake cooling issues. The CFR Chief stated there were no indications of fire or smoke. There were no brake cooling issues. ZZZ Ops cleared us to gate X. We resumed taxi to the gate; with CFR following us to ensure absolute safety.We parked the aircraft at the gate and were met by Maintenance and the Fire Chief. THE ALARMS WERE ALL STILL SOUNDING. Maintenance came on board and tried to figure it out; to no avail; prior to us leaving. Passengers were safely deplaned and sent to another gate for continuation to ZZZ1. With the alarms still sounding at the gate; the Captain and I both commented on how fortunate we were to have on noise cancelling headsets; otherwise communication would have been nearly impossible. This was a very unusual emergency and I hope that we are provided follow-up with the cause of the malfunction.",,"B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported an air turn back caused by a malfunctioning central warning computer.",

We [requested ATC priority handling for an air return] and put our O2 masks on. I called the Flight Attendants (FA's) and asked if they smelled anything. They said yes. We made an approach and overweight landing to Runway XXL. Prior to landing; I called on another radio for a gate. By this time at least one FA was on portable O2. I asked the Tower to send paramedics to Gate. I began the fumes checklist on the QRC. Once those initial actions were complete I stopped because we were getting close to a landing. Two AML entries were made. One for the fumes event and another for an overweight landing. According to the AML; the aircraft hit a bird the day before and an engine was bore scoped. When we arrived at the gate; Maintenance was powering hydraulic systems and testing reversers. When we got to the gate; I told the passengers to exit out the forward door quickly.

Ground Ops and taxi out to runway XXL were uneventful. As soon as the engines reached FLEX power; a slight burning metal smell began. This smell; experienced from time to time when the engines run up; normally dissipates in a matter of seconds. This time it remained throughout the entire takeoff roll. All other aircraft indications were normal during rotation and clean up. The smell persisted and a dirty sock smell was now prevalent; intensifying somewhat as we made a turn to a 230 heading with a climb up to 12;000 feet. At 4;000 feet we elected to stop the climb; don oxygen masks; and [advised ATC the need of an air return]. As a side note; it was hard to hear ATC and ICS with the loud noise of breathing with the masks on. At this point I remained the Pilot Flying and the Captain informed ATC of our intention to return for an immediate landing on runway XXL. The Captain was also made aware by the #2 Flight Attendant that the #1 Flight Attendant was on oxygen and still feeling very sick. I loaded the FMS for arrival and began a descent/vectors for the ILS runway XXL approach. At this time the Captain completed the Smoke/Avionics Smoke/Fumes QRH Quick Action procedure and informed the passengers and flight attendants of our intention to land. We were over maximum landing weight by roughly 4;000 lbs.; but elected to proceed with the descent checklist and land instead of working through the QRH procedure for Overweight Landing due to time. The approach; landing; and taxi in were uneventful.This aircraft; Aircraft X; had a birdstrike in the #1 Engine on the preceding flight. The maintenance actions were signed off. It is possible that the fume event could be related to this event. Fume events are a recurring issue across most fleets and airlines.

Maintenance interrogated the system and MEL'd the message iaw MEL XX-XX. Enroute the Purser called and stated 'we have an issue; in reviewing our manual we have a Class A fume event in the forward galley. It smells like dirty gym socks.' I've had fume events in the past and I know the ramifications to the safety of the crew and passengers. We also have received good training during [Flight Attendant Training]. In the cockpit we didn't smell anything. All three flight attendants confirmed the same smell. With a Jump seat rider in the cockpit; I made the decision to take a quick bathroom break. Upon reaching the front right galley is was prevalent; mild and persistent. Upon returning to the cockpit I had the purser remain in the cockpit. I used air cell to call Dispatch and maintenance. With pilots; purser; dispatch and maintenance all on the phone call we jointly made the decision it's best to divert to a suitable airport. Over the vicinity of ZZZ2 and ZZZ3 we evaluated diversions to outstations; continue to ZZZ4 or ZZZ5. We were 570 miles from ZZZ4 and 240 from ZZZ5. Knowing ZZZ5 was just as close as spiraling down from FL380 and the aircraft would be grounded; we took into consideration passengers re-accomodation; medical response; inflight support and aircraft replacement. ZZZ5 was the best option and the joint decision was made to proceed to ZZZ5. I asked the First Officer (F/O) to [request priority] from ATC and we proceeded direct to a fix on ILS [Runway] XXR and landed and taxied to the Gate. With the jump seater being pregnant and the review of other events where fumes become hard to smell after long exposure; I requested everyone in cockpit to wear oxygen. I ran through QRC and [other procedures] multiple times to make sure we didn't miss any steps. Managing and reassessing the issue I think we did a pretty thorough job. I even turned on APU and ran bleeds to trouble shoot and nothing was working. The smell persisted in a mild to moderate amount especially in descent according to Flight Attendants (F/As). The purser had F/As rotate to mitigate one persons exposure. With a full aircraft we couldn't move anyone. Upon landing and shutting down we de-masked and opened up flight door. The first officer immediately noticed the smell and we left shortly after securing the aircraft.  I was not aware that the F/As had on the previous leg noticed any smell. They all reported after the event that the dirty socks smell was present on the previous flight. When I took over the aircraft I was again blind sided by this. The F/A in aft galley even said she replaced her socks thinking it was her feet. So my suggestion is to continue to encourage communications from the cabin and have these experiences validated and documented even if there is the slightest question to certain smells. I don't know if the Air Bleed message would have an impact on this event but if so maybe adding instructions to confirm with crew no odors prior to MEL. Having these Name (Purser) able to locate his references on his tablet was huge in assisting me with my QRH.",,"In cruise Flight Attendant (FA) reported odor in galley.

Got a call from approach at 8;100 feet letting us know we were low and to climb up to 8;600 feet I immediately disconnected the auto pilot and initiated a climb while maintaining LOC. After crossing ZZZZZ I then recommenced my descent and flew visually using the PAPI as my guidance. Landed the aircraft within the touch down range and stopped on the runway. CA taxied aircraft to gate. During taxi we were informed by approach that the GS had issues and they thought it had been fixed. We initially intercepted the GS and LOC approximately 20 miles out. At approximately 2 miles out the GS was back in line with the PAPI.",,"We were doing the ILS Z Runway XX into ZZZ. Night time; good visibility; no clouds. ATC had us at 9;500 feet; turned us to intercept final outside of ZZZZZ and cleared us for the approach. Autopilot was on. We were flaps 1 about 190 knots at the time and about 22 miles on final. We intercepted the localizer and the glide slope at about the same time. At which point we were busy setting touch down zone; putting flaps down and gear. A moment later ATC gives us an altitude low warning; climb immediately to 8;600 feet. The flying pilot ( first officer) immediately disconnected auto pilot and initiated climb. We were around 8;100 feet; on the glide slope; auto pilot on when this was initiated from what we could tell. We had just passed ZZZZZ (FAF; but 17 miles out). The controller mentioned they had some glide slope problems just a week or two prior; and asked us if we were ok to proceed visually. Still being over 10 miles out; runway and PAPI in site; and glide slope still showing slightly below us; we proceeded visually with reference to PAPI and GS. The problem may have been from the auto pilot intercepting the LOC and GS at the same time and possibly overshooting the GS as it sometimes does when far out and possibly exasperated by configuration changes. This all happened about 15 to 20 miles from touchdown.

When the FO stowed the Speed Brakes the aircraft abruptly rolled 35 degrees to the left. The autopilot had difficulty controlling the aircraft so we disconnected and FO flew manually. The FO quickly and accurately corrected the left-roll tendency with right ailerons; leveled the wings and continued the arrival. Simultaneously to these events the SPOILERS EICAS illuminated. We slowed to 250 KIAS to minimize the left-roll tendency and informed ATC. We decided to have the FO continue to fly and handle radios while I ran the non-normal checklist; coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance and ran the TEST with the Lead Flight Attendant. After finishing the SPOILERS EICAS checklist and the other coordination was complete it was determined that some of the spoilers on the left wing remained in the UP position and would not stow. I opted to request priority handling and requested the ILS to Runway XXC with a long; 20 mile final; which ATC coordinated. We then gradually slowed and configured the aircraft; determining the aircraft controllability with each configuration change. Once final landing configuration (Flaps 30) and target speed were established the aircraft continued the left-roll tendency but was manageable. The FO accurately noted that at target speed the speed tape showed little margin above stick shaker activation; so we opted to add 10 Knots to our target speed. I believe this was due to the spoilers still extended on the left wing. The remainder of the approach and landing being uneventful as the FO made an excellent landing.

FA said it sounded like someone pounding on the fuselage with a sledgehammer repeatedly. We leveled off at FL280 immediately and reduced speed from 280 KIAS to 250 KIAS. I asked the FO to look for a nearby field with good weather.  FA recorded the noise via video on her cell phone and brought it to the cockpit. After reviewing the video; we decided to divert to ZZZ. We notified dispatch and coordinated with the FA's and informed the passengers. During the descent and configuration of the aircraft for landing at ZZZ; with the flaps at 5deg; I called for Flaps 10 while the aircraft speed was at 209 KIAS. I immediately said 'delay that stay at flaps five.' I believe the FO moved the flap handle out of the 5 detent and returned it immediately. The flaps remained at 5 degrees and I continued to slow the aircraft. I called for gear down an Flaps 15; flaps 25; flaps 30 landing checklist. I noticed the stick shaker indicator on the airspeed tape was in an unusual position and cross checked the configuration to find the flaps were at 5. We were at approximately 1200 feet when I announced 'going around'; but did not hit TOGA as I did not want GA thrust. At this point; the FO and I were convinced that the two problems were related; that there was some structural damage to the flaps.We climbed to 5;000 feet and referenced the Checklist for FLAPS - TRAILING EDGE FLAPS DISAGREE. We returned the flap lever to 5; then selected 2. The flaps retracted to 2. The checklist directed us to 'Proceed normally.' We had a discussion about what that meant and were not comfortable with extending the flaps again; with suspected mechanical damage to the flaps already existing. We got a phone patch with Maintenance Control and dispatch on HF and discussed the two issues and our checklist. They had no additional advice. We discussed the plan to land in the current flap configuration (flap 2); using the flap up speeds with Maintenance Control and dispatch. The FO had already assessed the landing distance and we referenced the FLAPS- TRAILING EDGE FLAPS UP LANDING checklist. We landed on RWY XXL at ZZZ; at VREF 40 + 40 + 5. I used auto brakes 3; and rolled to the end of the runway. We had the fire/rescue look us over for damage prior to proceeding to the gate. They reported a large cable hanging from the satellite antenna. The PSEU (Proximity Switch Electronics Unit) light came on after landing. The FO and I debriefed the events in detail post flight and during the next two flights. It was not until the following morning; that I realized that in all likelihood; I caused the flap malfunction by calling for flaps 10 at 209 KIAS. The SATCOM antenna seal failure noise was significantly concerning; and I assumed the flap issue was directly related.",,,,"First Officer reported a SATCOM antenna became dislodged on take off; repeatedly striking against the fuselage.

When we looked down; the Captain noticed that IFF 2 had a fault and switched it to his side. At about that time we both noticed a power surge which made my clock blank momentarily and the Captain noticed lights on his panel flash. Next we had a series of lights come on spaced apart by a few minutes at first and then began to come on more quickly as time passed. First we had a cooling fan supply light. Then when cleared to descend via the arrival; I pushed recall and noticed the left pack light remained illuminated. Suspecting something wrong with the power distribution system; I cycled through electrical panel wafer switch positions and found no amps coming from TR 2 or 3 and negative 3 amps on the battery. I hacked my clock. About 5 minutes had already passed. I took the radios while the Captain ran the checklist for the pack light next and shortly after; we lost the left aft fuel boost pump. I told the Captain I thought we had a power distribution problem and we were draining our battery. I thought we might be slowly shedding components due to their power sources being associated with the battery. As we passed 10;000 ft. I told the Captain and he put away the book and ran the landing checklist. While on the descent; I recommended [requesting priority handling] so we could land ASAP. I configured early in prep for a slam dunk and the Captain and I agreed to starting the APU just in case. By this time we were on base and more lights had come on. We lost the B Electrical Hydraulic Pump; had a right side window over heat light; battery discharge light; TR fail light; and a few pitot lights had come on. Then while turning to final; I noticed the short vectors would overshoot me so I clicked off autopilot and turned. That's when I noticed I had no electric trim. The Captain manually ran the trim for me as we slowed and configured and we had an uneventful landing. After the fire trucks greeted us and found no hot spots around the E & E bay; we discussed whether we had enough power on the battery and I noted the time had been 17 minutes from when I noticed the negative amps on the battery and started the clock. We continued to taxi to the gate and after the fire crew came up I went with them down to the E & E bays to do my own inspection. I didn't see or smell anything. Aircraft X is an old airplane.

All engine indications appeared normal including engine fuel flow.  Checking our fuel we determined we were showing an imbalance of approximately 1500 pounds with the right wing being low. We continued to monitor to determine if the fuel imbalance remained stable or if the imbalance was increasing. We received a second call from the flight attendant informing us we had a company A320 instructor pass riding. He and I spoke and he told me it appeared to be fuel trailing the #2 engine. I sent the First Officer back to the cabin for a visual inspection and told him to look forward and aft of the wing and specifically any damage he might see on the forward edge of the wing.  While he performed a visual inspection; the flight attendant in the cockpit showed me cell phone video of the leak. I leveled off at FL380 and verified the fuel imbalance was increasing to about 1700lbs with the right wing on the low side.  I referenced the QRH for fuel leak and sent dispatch a message that we had a fuel leak; needed to divert and would be shutting down the #2 engine. The First Officer returned and informed me of the same information and we began running the fuel leak QRH.  Dispatch recommended ZZZZ and looking at our distance and time required for descent I determined it to be a proper divert location. I [requested priority] with ZZZZ Center and requested an immediate turn to ZZZZ and descent to FL 200. The First Officer and I ran the fuel leak QRH which directed an engine shutdown for a fuel leak out of the engine or pylon followed by the engine shutdown checklist.  We shut the engine down in an idle power descent and I started the APU. I then transferred flying duties to the First Officer.  ZZZZ Center handed us off to ZZZZ Approach. ZZZZ is an non radar airfield. They told us to report 30 miles from the airfield and asked if we could maintain VMC.   Weather was scattered to broken with some vertical development but was sufficient to maintain VMC and the field was reporting 6;000 scattered.  Approach gave us a descent to 7;000 and offered the [non-precision] Approach to Runway XX. I asked for the ILS for XX. Approach asked if we could fly a visual to Runway 26 and conditions were sufficient for that and we were cleared for the visual approach. We never received guidance information on our ILS though it was programmed correctly. After an uneventful landing by the First Officer we taxied to a hard stand. Foreign Country aviation authorities inspected our certificates/medical/airworthiness certificate/insurance certificate which the company instructor was very helpful working that while I worked with operations. Operations moved the passengers indoors to a gate seating area. I worked with the Chief Pilot and Maintenance Control. They informed me that the passengers would be taken on a flight from ZZZZ-ZZZZ1-ZZZ. I made several announcements and trips to the gate holding area and informed all passengers of our plan.  Most of the passengers had left carry-on bags on the aircraft; but Foreign Country security wouldn't let them return to retrieve it. I coordinated with Station Operations to have aft air stairs brought up so we could get the passenger to come back and file front to back through the airplane to retrieve their items before their inbound flight arrived and coordinated with Foreign Country security.  Foreign Country security eventually agreed but only allowing 4 passengers at a time.",,"On climbout from ZZZZ1 we were passing FL280 when the Flight Attendant (FA) called us.  He said a passenger (who is a pilot) said that it looked like fuel was coming out of our #2 engine.  We monitored the fuel page.  The engine fuel used totals were identical; as were the wingtip tanks.  The inboard wing tanks showed an imbalance of 1000 pounds.  Over the remaining 5 minutes of our climbout we watched the imbalance increase to 1400 pounds.  During this time we got another call from the FA.  He put us on with an Airbus Instructor that was non-revving in the back.  He told us it appeared that fuel was coming from the engine exhaust.The Captain took over the aircraft and I went back to look for myself.  There was nothing visible on the front of the wing or the front of the engine.  I went back to row XX and could clearly see a fluid coming out of the exhaust of #2.  I returned to the flight deck and told the Captain.  We ran the Fuel Leak checklist and it directed us to shut down the engine.  After starting a descent to FL200; we did so.  We secured the engine and talked to dispatch.  He directed us to either ZZZZ1 or ZZZZ.  ZZZZ1 was further and the weather was reported as suboptimal.  We chose ZZZZ.The Captain and I turned the aircraft back to ZZZZ and finished the descent to FL200.  We briefed up the approach and I took control of the aircraft.  Approach control informed us there was no radar service.  We used the local MSA to ensure terrain clearance until we were clear of the clouds and could see the airfield.  I maneuvered the aircraft to a 6-7 mile final and we configured the aircraft for landing.  There was no glideslope which we knew; but the localizer wasn't working either.  We confirmed with Tower that they could see us and that we were lined up on the correct airport.  During the confusion we forgot the Before Landing Checklist; but the Spoilers Not Armed message reminded us.  We accomplished the checklist and were fully stable and complete by 500 ft. AGL.Landing was normal; the Captain took the aircraft around 80 knots on the rollout.  We taxied clear to a hard stand near the terminal.  Most of the passengers deplaned into the terminal.

I told her to see if she could determine the source of the smoke and if there was a fire for her to put it out. I was the pilot monitoring and I [requested priority handling] and asked ATC for an airport to divert to for an immediate landing.  ATC recommended ZZZ and cleared us direct. I asked ATC to advise our dispatch of our intentions. I completed the QRC checklist and advised the First Officer to continue flying. I then proceeded with the QRH. I checked with the flight attendants and they told me that the smoke had stopped and there was no sign of fire. The first asked me if she should plan on an precautionary landing and I told her yes. I briefed the first flight attendant and then advised the passengers of the same. As we descended I 'all-called' the flight attendants and again asked them if there was any sign of smoke in the cabin. They said 'no sign of smoke and that the smell had dissipated.'  At this point I was confident that we had eliminated the smoke source. I checked ZZZ in the manual which listed it as an alternate airport. While looking at the manual I saw that ZZZ1 is listed as a Regular airport. Per step 4 of the QRH SMOKE procedure I discussed the option of landing at ZZZ1 with the First Officer and we decided it was a better choice now that we had determined the smoke had been positively eliminated. I checked with the flight attendants again and was advised by them that the cabin was still clear of any smoke or odor.  We changed our destination with ATC and I believe I sent an ACARS to dispatch advising them of the same. If not; I typed it but failed to send it. We were still very busy at that time and I do recall receiving an acknowledgement from him. I then called the flight attendants one more time and advised them that I was de-escalating the situation to a precautionary landing and we had changed our destination to ZZZ1. We landed and taxied to the gate at ZZZ1 without further incident. After arriving at the gate I advised the passengers to stay seated while the fire personnel came on board the aircraft. Fire personnel boarded the aircraft and I explained the situation to them. I asked them if they would check row XX as a safety precaution. The cabin was unlit due to the Commercial P.B. [push button] being pushed. I had turned off the Commercial P.B. while executing the QRC check list. Later that evening while reviewing the procedure I realized that the QRC directs only for the GALLEY & CAB P.B. to be turned off. Turning off the Commercial P.B was an error on my part while executing the QRC checklist. The cabin was dimly lit and I wanted to restore the cabin lights but I did not want to start the problem all over again. I asked the first if she had switched off all electrical power to the seats and entertainment system and she said yes. I believe I asked her twice and she said yes each time. I turned the Commercial P.B. back on and very quickly thereafter a flight attendant came from the back to the front and said smoke was again coming from row XX. I immediately turned the Commercial P.B. back off and told the first flight attendant to initiate emergency deplaning procedures. The passengers all exited the aircraft calmly and without incident. Fire personnel then checked row XX with thermal imaging and told me that there was no unexpected heat source. The passengers then returned for their belongings and I contacted my dispatcher and briefed him on the situation.  I have attempted to be as accurate and thorough in this report as possible; however; I know there are things that I have not remembered or remembered in the wrong order.I take full responsibility for turning the Commercial P.B. off while executing the QRC. I believe the error occurred due to task saturation and an urgency on my part to rectify the situation. I also take full responsibility for turning the Commercial P.B. back on at the gate. I sincerely thought that it was a safe and good course of action to turn the lights back on. It was my decision and in retrospect I was wrong. If I am presented with a similar situation in the future it will not happen again. I do not have any suggestions to prevent this particular situation from occurring in the future. As for myself I will endeavor to be more precise and deliberate while executing an Emergency Checklist.",,,,"Captain reported diverting after Flight Attendant reported smoke and fumes in the cabin.

I transferred control to the First Officer and completed the ECAM actions.  After referencing the QRH; there were many items now unavailable for use on landing.   Among these were gravity gear extension and no nose steering upon landing.  I contacted dispatch and maintenance to let them know our situation; and they advised us that ZZZ and tech ops would be ready for us upon landing.   I reiterated to dispatch that we would need a tow in from the runway upon landing and was assured they would be ready.  We briefly thought about diverting; but with a full load we were overweight.   We elected to continue to ZZZ.We discussed at length on the flight southbound what we needed to do upon arrival.   I chose not to inform inflight or the customers of the failure until closer to ZZZ.  I called the #1 up to the cockpit about an hour out and explained to her we had a code yellow.  I went into detail the nature of the problem and how it might affect our landing.   I explained that I didn't think there would be anything abnormal on landing other than the fire trucks and being towed to the gate.  Everyone was professional and did their jobs as trained.  I made a PA to the customers about 40 minutes out and explained the failure in layman's terms and what they could expect on landing.Out of an abundance of caution with a hydraulic failure; I instructed the First Officer to request priority handling with ZZZ approach.  After all pertinent information was exchanged we requested a 20 mile final to be sure we could get all checklist items completed before landing.  On downwind we slowed and lowered the gear successfully by the gravity extension.   We then configured the aircraft for landing.  ATC asked if we were ready for the approach and we flew a 15 mile final to runway 10L.  We reiterated to the tower that we would not be able to clear the runway upon landing.  We touched down about 1500 feet down the runway and braked to a stop abeam Taxiway XX.  I made a quick PA when the aircraft stopped to ask everyone to stay seated.  We completed the after landing checklist; started the APU and shut down the engines.  The tug then entered the runway; hooked up to us and towed us to Gate XX.  The required logbook entries were made and I discussed our failure with CFR and tech ops.

We did apply the QRH procedure for BRAKES SYS 2 FAULT; but as soon as BRAKES SYS 2 FAULT cleared; we got a 'BRAKES SYS 1 FAULT' ECAM.I transferred aircraft control to the First Officer; and also delegated the radios to him.

We had fuel in the center tank and both center pumps were on. On climbout; the Captain noticed a slight fuel imbalance; with the right tank lower; and shortly after that the 'fuel imbalance' annunciator light turned on. We were climbing through about 16000 ft. when we started troubleshooting the issue. It appeared by the totalizer and right tank quantity indicators that we were either burning fuel from the right tank or had a fuel leak from the right wing or engine.As we climbed the imbalance worsened as the totalizer also indicated higher fuel loss than expected. The imbalance worsened to about 1500 lbs; and we attempted to balance the tanks by transferring fuel from left to right. The increase in fuel imbalance was abated using this method; and it also started to reduce the imbalance.We ran the QRH checklist for a potential fuel leak; deciding not to shut down the right engine to expedite the divert and due to our heavy weight; suspecting that would be less safe than keeping it running. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ via vectors to a visual approach Runway XX; with the ILS used as a backup.It was night and the weather was VFR. Upon an uneventful landing I utilized the left engine thrust reverser and we stopped on the runway and shutdown the right engine as a precaution. Emergency vehicles met the airplane to inspect the right wing and engine; nothing noteworthy was discovered. We taxied to the gate and shutdown the left engine; non-normal complete.CRM between myself and the Captain was excellent throughout the flight. The Captain read all non-normal checklist aloud and asked if I had any inputs or questions when appropriate. The demeanor in the cockpit was professional; calm; and business-like at all times as we worked our way through solving the problem and executing a divert back to ZZZ. The decision not to shut down the right engine was discussed at length and we both concluded that due to cockpit indications and our heavyweight the best course of action was to land immediately and shut it down on the runway. In retrospect this proved to be the correct call after maintenance personnel discovered multiple faults with the fuel totalizer and both wing compensators causing major fuel system instrument irregularities; and in fact no fuel leak was present.",,,,"B737 Captain reported an air turn back after a fuel imbalance was detected during climbout.",

Crew rest was good; and I reported fit for duty about an hour before pick-up time from the hotel. We arrived at the plane slightly ahead of schedule. The Captain (CA) and I discussed a hydraulic leak on the aircraft that occurred the previous day. I was the first one on the plane and began the preflight. While testing the fire system I noticed the left engine fire loop did not illuminate. Further troubleshooting revealed the problem was with the 'B' loop. The CA reported the problem to maintenance. They confirmed the problem and deferred the issue. We left the system on the 'A' loop.  On the walk around I noticed that the left wheel well was abnormally dirty and still wet from the previous leak. I specifically looked closely at the fire bottles and couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. The levels were good.Taxi and takeoff were uneventful.On departure passing approximately 15;000 feet MSL the CA noticed the left engine overheat light flickered then went out. He tested the bulb and it tested good. I immediately went to the EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) gauges and noticed a 20-degree higher temperature on the left engine; but still well within limits. While I was looking at the EGT gauge the CA reported that the intermittent indications bounced back and forth between overheat and fault. When I looked down to study the light pattern the left engine fire light came on. We very briefly discussed that this seemed like an indication problem versus an actual fire/overheat; but we had to honor the lights in case there was something we could not see with other fire/overheat indications.The CA transferred aircraft control to me while he ran the checklist. I confirmed a level off with the CA and coordinated with ATC. We were initially assigned FL190; but we were already passing it; so I asked for FL200. I disengaged the autopilot and auto throttles anticipating correcting for single engine flight. The CA then confirmed the left engine immediate action items with me. I added right rudder and right rudder trim as the left engine spooled down. I coordinated with the CA and ATC for a left turn back to ZZZ along with a descent.Things got busy. I was manually flying; navigating; negotiating vectors and altitudes; and landing runway with ATC. The CA split his time then between running the checklist; paying attention to what I was doing; talking to the flight attendants; passengers; dispatch; and maintenance. I asked the CA if I should coordinate for holding and he said no. I began loading the approach for ZZZ ILS XXL; but did not execute until I could coordinate it with the CA. We went back and forth as to the best way to re-cruise the system. Eventually I just spun the cruise setting on the pressurization panel down to 7;000 ft.; and loaded 7;000 into the cruise page.Approaching abeam the field approximately 5;000 ft. the CA was ready to resume flying. He reloaded the approach; then asked me to extend the final approach fix ZZZZZ.We got an immediate descent and a 'tight' base vector abeam the final approach fix. There is a 'safety alert' when landing north on the Company Ops page that we were both aware of.The CA asked for the deferred items; but I did not have them up on my checklist. We were only about 8 miles out from the field at this point and in a great position to land; so the Captain decided it was better to continue at this point than go around. After realizing my checklist SA (Situational Awareness) was low and behind; I tried to keep the bigger picture safety of flight items in my cross check: aircraft configuration; energy state; threats from VFR aircraft at ZZZ1; and our approach into ZZZ.ZZZ approach kept us tight and close to ZZZ to avoid ZZZ1 traffic. We were given a 'dog-leg' to final that was going to have us intercept final inside the FAF. The final approach fix ZZZZZ is 8NM from the runway. We were told not to descend out of 2;600 ft.; until past the extended centerline forRunway XX/XY and cleared for the visual approach to Runway XXL. It was a beautiful VFR day; and we were visual with ZZZ and ZZZ1 15-20 miles out. I was occupied with searching for conflicting traffic at ZZZ1. The CA asked me to arm the approach; but it would not activate. We were also now busy configuring the gear and flaps to 15 and slowing to target speed. Rather than keep messing with the approach mode I announced we were past the conflict at ZZZ1 and visual to the correct runway and cleared to descend. We switched to tower and were cleared to land on Runway XXL.We used the normal landing checklist but modified it for our single engine approach.Final approach and landing were uneventful. We elected to exit off the runway and onto a taxiway to stop.The Tower gave us a ground frequency that the Fire Chief would also be on. We spoke to the fire department; and they checked out the aircraft and ran a thermal temperature sensor over the engines and the brakes. While they were doing that I talked to Company Ops about a gate. The fire chief declared the aircraft to be safe; so I coordinated to taxi back to the new gate.Upon engine shutdown at the gate; I noticed the left engine start level was not in cutoff.In retrospect; I should have advocated (or requested) to go into holding. It was not obvious at the time; but I had lost SA on what actions the CA had accomplished and where we were at in the checklist. It only became clear when on base he asked me for the 'deferred items' and I did not have them called up. The extra time would have allowed for a more thorough mind-meld. It would have also given us the opportunity to catch any checklist mistakes. I felt like we had a solid; simple plan to come back VFR to the long runway with a single engine approach. We got the aircraft and passengers back in a safe and efficient manner; but it felt rushed. It was only afterward that I recognized that the rushed feeling was self-imposed.",,"On preflight the fire test failed and ultimately the B loop was found to be inoperative. The B loop was deferred. A new Maintenance Release was obtained.On push back during the After Start Checklist recall we discovered that the zone temp lights for all three temperature zones were on but cleared when the master caution was pressed indicating a single temperature control failure. I noticed that the trim air switch was left in the on position during electrical transfer to the generators from the APU so we called Dispatch and Maintenance and the trim air system was placed on deferral. A new Maintenance Release was obtained.We proceeded normally to Runway XXR and departed normally. I was flying and the First Officer was Pilot Not Flying.On climb out above 15;000 feet we started getting master caution alerts over about a two minute period of time. The first was a number one engine over heat. Then we got a FAULT light on the fire control protection panel. Then a fire warning for the number one engine. All indications were temporary and went out on their own.The First Officer and I discussed what we were witnessing and decided that the safest course of action was to [advise ATC] and as a precaution; run the ENGINE FIRE OR ENGINE SEVERE DAMAGE OR SEPARATION checklist even though I highly suspected it was an indication problem with the fire control protection system. Factors supporting this decision were it was day VMC; we had just left ZZZ and we were both familiar with the airport having landed there the day prior.I [advised] with ATC and requested to return to ZZZ. The First Officer became the Pilot Flying and I assumed the Pilot Not Flying duties to run the checklist. The checklist was completed and the ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE LANDING checklist was completed to deferred items.After talking with the First Officer after the flight I realized I skipped step 3 of the ENGINE FIRE OR ENGINE SEVERE DAMAGE OR SEPARATION checklist.... engine start lever confirm...cutoff. It was an honest mistake and not intentionally done.The flight attendants were given [the required] information. Dispatch was notified and a ELB entry was made. I made a PA announcement to the passengers informing them that we had to shut down the left engine and we were returning to ZZZ. I asked ZZZ approach to roll the fire trucks just in case we had an actual fire.Since we had just left ZZZ; we set up for a visual backed up with the ILS XXL approach. I briefed the approach and were set up for a single engine flaps 15 landing.Until this point I thought the flow of our checklists and coordination was comfortable and progressing well. I took controls of the aircraft to fly the approach but when I asked for the deferred items; the First Officer said he couldn't find the checklist on his iPad. I should have simply passed my iPad to him to complete the checklist but at the time I thought it would be just a brief amount of time until he had deferred items. Because we were day VMC and we were in a controlled good position I thought the safest course of action was to continue being vectored for landing and not extend on downwind. I elected to operate under my authority and continue towards ZZZ without having the First Officer read the Deferred Checklist items on the deferred portion of the checklist. I was also comfortable doing this because while running the checklist myself earlier; I glanced through the items ahead of time because they are located on the same page of the main checklist. It was not good crew coordination but I felt it was safer than extending out from where we currently were. We were in a good easy flowing path towards the runway and I elected to continue.We did land with the engine bleeds on which was a step on the deferred items of the ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE LANDING checklist to turn them off and land bleeds off. This again was not intentional as my review of the deferral steps did not catch this correctly as I intended. As I said earlierthough I thought the best safest course of action was to continue the approach to a landing.ZZZ Approach vectored us for a visual and an intercept inside the FAF of [Runway] XXL because it is a long final over 5 miles long. I flew the visual to XXL and had the First Officer use the normal checklist card for the landing checklist. A normal landing was made and we stopped on the taxiway clear of the runway to allow the fire trucks to inspect the number one engine and for any potential hot brakes. Normal readings were found by the firemen and we taxied to the gate.Things that could have gone better:I did not explicitly say or remind the First Officer that we would be doing a flaps one go around if required in the brief and because we didn't run the deferred items of the one engine inoperative checklist we did not remind ourselves as the check list would have. At all times I knew that a flaps one go around would be accomplished; if required.I did not realize that the First Officer was feeling rushed and didn't have the checklist up to run on his own. I have been used to flying with more senior first officers and just assumed he would pull up the checklist on his own. Next time I will be more explicit in my instructions and anticipate getting both myself and the First Officer on the same page. I will make sure that the iPad that has the checklist being read from is continued to be used to finish deferred items if either pilot is not on the same page.I apologize for my errors made.",,"B737 flight crew reported engine overheat indications during departure climb.

It was a bit turbulent on the way out so we waited until it smoothed out to do service.  During service around rows 7-13 I noticed a very heavy; thick foul locker room type smell. I had a burning in my chest; in my eyes and nose. I told [F/A name] and asked if he noticed anything?  He said he did smell something bad; but he wasn't feeling any symptoms. I got a headache; dizziness; light headedness and became short of breath. I notified the Captain as I was the Lead Flight Attendant last night. I asked the 2 other flight attendants if they noticed the smell. [F/A name] walked through the rows I told her and said she smelled it a little bit but said she didn't feel any symptoms. [name] didn't notice anything as she was in the back of the aircraft. I do not know if any passengers were affected as my own medical care became urgent.After about 15 minutes my chest tightened and I became so short of breath I headed to the back of the aircraft because I was worried I was going to faint. My head was pounding in the base of my skull and in the back of my neck. I had taken an [medication] just in case it was heart burn; but it did not help with the burning in my chest and my nose. In the back of the aircraft I became very weak and my arms and hands started to cramp up in weird formations and I couldn't feel my arms or control my fingers. One of the flight attendants put me on oxygen. My hands got stuck like I was having a seizure; and I could not move my fingers. It was also hard to move my arms. I lost feeling in my legs from the waist down and in my feet. I had to lay on the floor because I was afraid I was going to fall and couldn't walk because I couldn't feel my feet. The other flight attendants asked for medical assistance on board. My apple watch was showing a high heart rate and the medical people on the aircraft started to remove my clothing so they could put the AED on me; but they were having difficulty because I could not move. We were still flying with approximately 18 minutes left of flight based on the timer on my watch. I had to move from the FA4 jump seat to the floor. When I was flat on the floor and could not move my own body. I was very weak. They landed the plane with me on the floor and I think 2-3 people around me holding me trying to work on me so I was safe. They kept saying I was tachycardic. When we landed the paramedics came on board the aircraft and kicked the 3 people out. They cut my clothes off; started an IV; put me on new oxygen; and finally put the pads on my chest. The paramedics said I was tachycardic and in SVT [Supraventricular Tachycardia]. They had to lift me into a wheelchair to remove me from the aircraft. I was then put on a stretcher and taken to the hospital by ambulance. Inside the ambulance they hooked me up to the AED to monitor my heart. They gave me another IV and I think they gave me some kind of medicine. I don't remember what it was because I was fading in and out. My body became very limp and I just wanted to sleep. My arms kept having pains and the spasms of my arms tightening and my fingers getting stuck kept happening on and off for quite a while. And I couldn't feel my legs or my feet. My face was becoming numb and I couldn't feel my nose or my lips. The paramedics kept saying I was in SVT and not out of the woods yet. They said my condition was not consistent with life. This scared me. At the hospital so many people were there so quickly to work on me. I tried to give them my health history; current medications; and showed them the heart monitor on my chest that my cardiologist had prescribed in case that would help them. I also tried to show them my phone that was connected to my apple watch in case that information could also help them since I have the apple watch 6 which monitors my heart rate; oxygen level; and can do an ECG. I bought that watch last year to help monitor my body while I was flying because of the other 2 fume events that happened in year that landed me in the hospital back then. It was all so very scary and embarrassing. After some testing; blood work; and continued heart monitoring I was released after a few hours and sent to a hotel where I am at now. I will fly back to ZZZ later this afternoon.The doctor said I had Supraventricular Tachycardia; elevated levels of carbon monoxide; and that I had acute hyperventilation syndrome.",,,,"Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a fumes event during initial descent.

Approximately 4 hour and 45 mins into the flight we started to notice a growing imbalance in between the main fuel tanks one and two. The number two side was decreasing in quantity at a much faster rate than the number one side. We got the fuel imbalance caution associated with the issue and as it continued to increase we went to the QRH and settled on the 'fuel leak engine' checklist as it appeared to us that the imbalance could be from a potential leak. As we went through the process the Captain was in conversations with both Flight Operations and Dispatch about where to proceed next. By the time the conversations and checklist had been gone through we were in the best position to continue to ZZZ1. As we made our descent and continued to follow the checklist we secured the engine; as the parameters for doing so were present based on the checklist. We had already [requested priority handling] and continued to land safely at ZZZ1 on one engine per the single engine landing checklist.In the end it appears that the cross feed valve had failed but because there was no power to the valve it displayed itself in the closed position. During the fuel leak checklist it specifies to check the valve is closed which we did; but per the note in the checklist stated that if the circuit breaker was tripped that there would not be an indication of whether the valve was open or closed. I think that creating an item to check the circuit breaker as a set as opposed to just a note would help increase a successful recognition of that possible situation for other crews going forward. Because of the possible time critical situation we were dealing with we followed the steps that we believed to be the correct course of action.",,"Flight was with scheduled departure from ZZZ and arrival at ZZZ1. Captain was pilot flying. First Officer was monitoring. Event began approximately 4.75 hours into the flight and one hour from touchdown at cruise altitude of FL380 abeam ZZZ2 to the north and ZZZ3 to the south. First indication of problem was Master Caution light and fuel imbalance indication showing #2 main fuel tank (right) approximately 1000 pounds less than #1 main tank (left). Engine indications showed the fuel flows matched; as did the total fuel used in each engine during the flight. The right tank continued to decrease at a much faster rate than the left; which led us to begin the 'Fuel Leak - Engine' QRH procedure. First Officer now became pilot flying. Captain became monitoring pilot and began the checklist. Step Y of this procedure was a decision point. The first bullet point has an 'and' conjunction between phrases. The second bullet point has an 'and/or' conjunction between the phrases. While the total fuel planned for landing at ZZZ1 remained constant during the entire event; the total quantity was decreasing at an abnormal rate in the right tank. We paused the checklist here to contact both Dispatch and the Flight Operations for input. Dispatch provided guidance that ZZZ2 was the better divert field and weather / NOTAMS / operations supported that decision. A continued discussion was accomplished by all parties at this part of the checklist. It appeared that we had a leak on the right engine; but planned fuel was remaining constant for our arrival at ZZZ1. Because we viewed the 'total fuel decreasing at an abnormal rate' in the right tank; I opted to proceed to step Z. Flight attendants were notified of the situation. At this point they are told to prepare to divert into ZZZ2. ZZZ1 Captain Name; who was deadheading on the flight; performed a visual check of the right engine and did not see any indication of fuel leak or vapor spray. However; our imbalance continued to increase towards 2;000 pounds between the main tanks. Step Z indicates a continued increasing imbalance should be viewed as confirmation of an engine fuel leak. This decision took us to step A; which begins the engine shutdown process. Again we paused the checklist; as we can see that the fuel imbalance is not linear in intensity. It has now slowed significantly. Right tank still had over 4;000 pounds of fuel. Left tank had over 6;000 pounds of fuel. Total fuel remained close to our planned arrival fuel. We discussed whether the safer course of action was shutting down the engine or allowing it to run. Total fuel remained constant; but the imbalance was slowly getting worse. By this time; we are now equal distance from ZZZ1 and ZZZ2. Weather is good at both locations. We elected to continue to ZZZ1 to minimize the risks of an unplanned descent into the divert field. Fuel calculations told us that even if we shut down the right engine and lose all remaining fuel in the right tank; we would be landing at ZZZ1 with over 4;000 pounds of fuel in the left tank. With concurrence of dispatch and the Flight Operations; we committed to ZZZ1 as the destination. Flight attendants were notified of the change in plans. [ATC was advised] at the top of descent to allow for priority handling into ZZZ1. At this point; we thought that a cross feed valve problem or a fuel gauge problem was more likely than a fuel leak. During descent; the 'non-linear' fuel imbalance began to get worse. The decision was made to shut down the right engine. Not so much to stop the possibility of a fuel leak; but to prevent an unplanned shutdown of that engine on final approach due to fuel starvation. Better to slowly and methodically secure the engine now than rush to do so later in the approach. The checklist was continued at step A and completed. The One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist was completed. A detailed PA was made to the passengers at 18;000 feet explaining both the fuel issue and the single engine situation. RNP (RNAV) approach to runway XXR was flown and landed by the First Officer. Aircraft was taxied clear of the runway at taxiway and inspected on taxiway by the Crash Fire Rescue team. We requested an evaluation of any fuel leaks around the right wing and right engine prior to proceeding to gate. No sign of any fuel leakage; so aircraft continued to the gate for normal deplaning process. No passenger questions or concerns are noted by the flight attendants. CFR chief has a few questions that are answered. Flight attendants; pilots and DH Captain Name had a crew debrief to address any questions; concerns; and improvements in communication. Flight Operations and Dispatcher were called individually by phone to debrief and collect feedback. Fuel imbalance at the gate was 2;600 pounds. No additional information. 1) Checklist choice: Two checklist options that I considered using during the event: Fuel Leak - Engine and Fuel Quantity Indicator Inoperative. However; the appropriate checklist to begin with would have been simply the indication warning itself: Fuel Imbalance. Using this checklist would have forced us to confirm proper operation of the cross feed valve; which ended up being the root cause of the problem. However; the rapidly decreasing quantity in the right tank (initially 10 pounds every six seconds) caused me to psychologically think 'fuel leak' or 'fuel gauge' problem. A perceived time critical situation caused me to not evaluate each option carefully in the Fuel - Abnormal Checklist section. 2)Fuel Leak - Engine checklist step Y: This decision point determines whether a fuel leak is probable or not. A decision must be made as to whether the 'total fuel quantity is decreasing at a normal rate' or 'total fuel quantity is decreasing at an abnormal rate'. During the event; I read this statement as total fuel quantity in the right tank decreasing at an abnormal rate. This evaluation caused me to continue the checklist at step Z and eventually shutdown the engine. But I can now see that this could be interrupted as total fuel remaining on the aircraft in all remaining fuel tanks. In that case; our total aircraft fuel was not decreasing at an abnormal rate and this checklist would have ended much differently. 3) Fuel Leak - Engine checklist step X: The step simply confirms the cross feed valve is closed. The step was accomplished; but not enough consideration was given to the 'caution' and the 'note' following this step. At this point in the event; I simply should have cycled the cross feed valve to verify it's proper operation. That would have taken the event in a very different direction (Cross Feed Selector Inoperative checklist). Ironically; my past experience has me take the extra step each flight of cycling the crossfeed value during the Captain's Before Start flow. This holdover step from my past provides confirmation that this valve will work 'if needed' later on during the flight. Unfortunately; I did not check it again at cruise when it truly mattered during this event. 4) Satellite Communication: The particular aircraft did not have SAT COM capability. Communication with Dispatch and the Flight Operations was difficult due to phone patch problems with ZZZ2 operations and ZZZ4. Our descriptions of the problem and resolution suggestions were not clearly heard and broken up; needing to be repeated for clarification. Perhaps with a clear line of communication more information would have been exchanged between the three parties. The addition of SAT COM capability to all aircraft would be helpful. 5) Pilot Flying / Pilot Monitoring: As stated in the irregularity narrative; the First Officer began the flight as the Pilot Monitoring. Once the event began and the crew saw that checklist usage was needed; the roles of the pilots were reversed. By having the FO take control of both the aircraft and the ATC communication; I was able to focus on both the checklist decisions and communication with all others. It was also the logical decision to have the FO continue the single engine approach to landing. This worked well and I highly encourage the training department to continue these defined roles during an event.",,"B737 flight crew reported a fuel imbalance developed while at cruise.

This discrepancy was reported to Maintenance and signed off before pushback. The takeoff; climb; and initial phase of cruise were all routine with the exception of slightly more turbulence than normal - nothing more than continuous light and occasional moderate; resulting in the seat belt sign being illuminated slightly longer and the FAs (Flight Attendant) being seated a bit more than normal. West of [the] river; the ride had smoothed out considerably; [so the] seat belt sign [was] off; and flight conditions became VMC.At FL360 approximately 200 NM east of ZZZ; we observed a G RSVR LO LVL ECAM. After running the complete ECAM; the CA (Captain); pilot monitoring; broke out the QRH and reviewed the entire procedure; including all of the INOP systems; most notably: GREEN HYD; SPLR 1+5; N/W STRG; NORM BRK; L/G RETRACT and REVERSER 1. We discussed the ramifications of continuing to ZZZ1 and after consulting Maintenance Control and Dispatch; decided that [requesting priority handling] with ATC and diverting to ZZZ would be the best and safest course of action. Our assumption was that there was a leak in the green hydraulic system as the HYD page indicated almost no fluid remaining in the green system. We were below max landing weight; so we accepted vectors onto the ZZZZZ Arrival and subsequently requested Runway XXL based upon the runway length. We calculated our landing distance to be approximately 6;000 ft. and Dispatch backed us up by calculating a stopping distance of 6;790 ft. Once coordination with Dispatch and Maintenance Control were completed; we ensured all applicable checklists were completed and briefed ATC; the FAs; and the passengers. We elected for the CA to take over as the pilot flying; and I assumed the duties of pilot monitoring during the arrival. We also elected to start the APU.When we were both comfortable with the state of the aircraft; our plan; and the field conditions; we began slowing the aircraft; configuring; and emergency-extended the landing gear at approximately 20 NM on final to Runway XXL. After executing the L/G Gravity Extension Checklist; we received indications that the gear was down and locked with the gear doors open; as expected. Shortly after extending the landing gear; we noticed blue procedural steps on the STS (Status) page for the approach to turn on both the green hydraulic pump and PTU; both of which we had secured in accordance with the original ECAM. After a brief discussion; we elected to turn both items on. However; within approximately one minute; we again saw the G RSVR LO LVL ECAM and promptly secured the green hydraulic pump and PTU in accordance with the ECAM at approximately 10 miles on final with the gear extended. Prior to touchdown; I made the PA call to "brace; brace; brace" followed by a "remain seated; remain seated" call as we approached a safe taxi speed on the runway after touchdown. The landing was uneventful and we ended up stopping on centerline using emergency brakes around the 7 board; 9;000 lb. remaining. After the crash crew inspected the aircraft and reported fluid under the #1 engine; Company Maintenance evaluated the aircraft; pinned the landing gear; and initiated a tow to the gate. We executed the Tow-In Procedure and multiple PA announcements were made to keep the passengers in the loop with what was going on prior to and during the tow.",,"While cruising at FL360 to the east of ZZZ; an ECAM message stating HYD G RSVR LO LVL appeared on the upper ECAM. The FO (First Officer) was pilot flying; so I told him he had the controls and the radios; and I would handle the ECAM. I followed the ECAM and turned the PTU (Power Transfer Unit) and Green ENG 1 Pump off. While running the ECAM we noticed a few things; the PTU; prior to being turned off; had been automatically deactivated and the G HYD System was completely empty. Prior to our flight the system was at a nominal level; so we suspected a leak somewhere in the system. After completing the ECAM I referenced the QRH to see if anything was missed. I told the FO I was going to the number 2 radio to talk to Dispatch and Maintenance Control [and] used ACARS. A few minutes later I was conversing with Dispatch and Maintenance Control on XXX.XX MHz. Maintenance Control confirmed that HYD G RSVR LO showed on his side. At this point we were still east of ZZZ and throughout the flight I checked weather at airports in case of an emergency. Because of the massive low-pressure system moving across the US; many airfields east of ZZZ had low visibility; gusty winds; and blowing snow. The safest alternate was ZZZ and we; Dispatch and I; decided to divert there and not continue to ZZZ1. I did not know why the G System emptied and did not want to continue across the [mountains] where airfields are scarce; and possibly have another hydraulic issue and be down to one system. I asked Dispatch to check my performance calculations that I had originally given him; and [to] send an ACARS when he had done so. I told Dispatch I was about to [request priority handling] and start the divert to ZZZ. He and Maintenance Control had nothing else for me so we signed off. At this point I rallied with FO and told him we would now [request priority handling] and begin our divert to ZZZ. The FO was still pilot flying and primary on the radios. My FO is a probationary pilot so I told him specifically how to [request priority handling] and the information ATC would require. He did a fine job doing that as I listened in on the #1 radio. I did not want my FO to feel overwhelmed so I stayed with him in order to get the FMGC (Flight Management and Guide Computer) squared away for the divert. Once that was complete and the aircraft headed towards ZZZ; I told him I needed to talk to the FAs (Flight Attendant) and passengers. He was instructed; prior to any altitude changes; to confirm with me first.My brief with the Purser was concise and he received all necessary information. I had the FAs prep the cabin for evacuation in the event something went terribly wrong; the Purser had no questions. The passengers were then briefed on the situation. After FA and passenger briefs were completed; I rallied again with the FO. We were now in the descent; via the ZZZZZ Arrival. We requested the longest available runway at ZZZ; XXL; and told ATC to standby because we still had a few things to accomplish. I gave the FO a brief review of the situation [and] we reviewed all information that is required prior to running the descent checklist: approach; how it is to be flown; etc. We also reviewed how we would fly a go-around; if required with the gear extended. A brief was also given on a worst-case scenario vs. best-case. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best was our approach to this situation.I told my FO; a very good pilot; that I would land the plane because I wanted the responsibility. We configured 20 miles out in order to give us time to extend the flaps / gear and run the Landing Gear Extension QRH. Since we were underweight yet still had the fuel to do so; I asked for a quick delaying turn to assure we had all checklists complete and the cabin was secured / ready. We made a successful landing on XXL; stopping with at least 8 - 9;000 ft. ahead of us. Thirty seconds out I had the FO make the Brace Call. At a slow speed the FO announced; "Remain seated; remainseated;" and we came to a stop. Since the APU was running; I told the FO to secure the engines so that ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) could approach and inspect the aircraft. Operations stated that a large puddle of fluid was beneath the Number 1 engine; and fluid up near the left engine pylon. There were no fire indications so we stood by and waited for our tow to the gate.While the outcome was successful there was one issue I did not expect. After dropping the gear via the Landing Gear Extension Checklist; the "Blue to Do" prompted us to turn the G Eng Pump back on. I did not expect that. My first assumption was why should we do that when the system is completely empty; but we followed the procedure. A few seconds later the ECAM sounded with the original message we got at cruise. I had the FO turn the pump back off.",,"A320 flight crew reported loss of the green hydraulic system resulted in a diversion and precautionary landing.",

After saying 'Your Aircraft' to the Captain who was Pilot Flying for this leg and the Captain responding with 'MY AIRCRAFT;' we looked up to the overhead panel and saw the LOW PRESSURE amber light illuminated to the FLT CONTROL B side. I opened the electronic QRH to page X and read the following Condition: 'Hydraulic system pressure to the ailerons. elevators and rudder is low.' After also reading the Objective; we accomplished the only step in the QRH by moving the FLT CONTROL switch on the affected side; after confirmation; to STBY RUD. This action illuminated two other amber lights: YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS. There was no mention in the QRH that these two lights would subsequently light after moving the FLT CONTROL B switch to STBY RUD. After seeing these two additional amber lights; I opened the QRH to review the instructions associated with these 2 amber lights. The FEEL DIFF PRESS QRH step said to continue normal operation but that control column forces may be higher than normal; particularly during the flare. We discussed this as a crew. We then reviewed the YAW DAMPER light QRH steps; followed them and reviewed those instructions as a crew (including not to land with flaps greater than 30 and to avoid moderate or severe turbulence). The YAW DAMPER amber light remained lit after following the QRH steps. After briefly discussing the option to land in ZZZ; the Captain made the decision to return to ZZZ1. I informed ATC of our desire to do a 180 degree turn and return to ZZZ1. The ATC Controller asked why; and I responded; due to a flight control problem. The Controller gave us instructions to turn north and then gave us a clearance to return to ZZZ1. The Controller also asked if we needed further assistance; and I stated not at this time. During the turn back to ZZZ1; it was obvious the YAW DAMPER system was not working as it felt like we would slip and slide through the air in response to every gust of wind. This was even more pronounced on final approach. En route to ZZZ1 we reviewed possible diversion options should we lose hydraulic quantity or pressure but both remained stable; although System A side QTY had reduced to about 80% from 105% at departure. En route; we lowered our altitude to increase fuel burn and reduce fuel on board as much as possible. The APU was also started for that reason. We read the FOM requirements for an overweight landing which clearly state that [priority handling must be requested]. As we checked in with ZZZ1 approach; I [requested priority handling] and our intentions to conduct an overweight landing with a flight control problem in ZZZ1. I asked for Runway XX with no LAHSO (Landing And Hold Short Operations) restriction. The ATC Controller asked for other information like fuel on board in minutes and souls on board. We had XXX souls on board. During final approach the Captain stated the flight controls felt sluggish and I could feel the aircraft slip and slide in the YAW axis. The Captain made a smooth landing at a low vertical rate of descent and we exited the runway and taxied to the gate with no further incident. CFR had been called and they were there along side the runway if needed. Possible blockage in the B side Flight Control Hydraulic lines.No suggestion on how to prevent this; but I would suggest adding additional information to the FLIGHT CONTROL LOW PRESSURE section of the QRH that includes the possibility that the YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS lights could also illuminate and to follow those QRH steps and discuss those flight implications as a crew. The QRH implicitly treats this flight condition as very benign due to the simplicity and lack of info in the QRH for this flight problem. Is a potential blockage in the hydraulic lines to the primary flight controls really a benign condition? A context to the severity or non-severity of this flight condition would be appreciated so that decisions on continuing flight or diverting can be better made.",,,,"B737-800 First Officer reported a FLT CONT EICAS light illuminated in cruise.

Simultaneously; the aircraft yawed to the right and the right engine RPM decayed somewhat.As we had heard from the previous departure that there were birds in the vicinity; our initial thought was perhaps we had ingested one or more birds. Due to the fact that we didn't see any and it was clear outside; we also thought that perhaps it was a compressor stall. My initial reaction was to retard the affected throttle; which had retarded [somewhat] on its own already. As soon as I did so; the engine behaved normally and I slowly increased the throttle again.We informed ATC that we wanted to return to ZZZ. They asked if we wanted to [request priority handling]. We said yes and told them fuel and souls on board. They allowed us an early level off; we spoke to company; the flight attendants; the passengers; and informed Dispatch that we were returning.

Tower told us to exit the runway to the right; which we did. The firetrucks were there waiting and Tower asked if we needed further assistance. We said no thank you and returned to the same gate from which we had departed.After landing we were met on the flight deck by two tech ops personnel. Name; ZZZ tech ops Supervisor was there to inquire as to the events that occurred. With him was Name 1. After that debrief; we received a call from Name 1 on my phone from ZZZ airport ops to gather more information. After that; we received a call from Name 2; flight manager; ZZZ. He inquired as to how we were doing and said he would call back to find out if we were feeling up to continuing a flight to ZZZ1. We both agreed we were up to the task; I called him back; and informed him of such.Shortly after exiting the plane; we were informed that there was a backup plane and we would be departing out of Gate X.

We were pushing back less than 2 1/2 hours after blocking in from the first flight.We were informed from the flight attendants that the passengers were giving kudos to the crew and the gate agents for the great team effort getting them back to ZZZ safely and back on another plane towards their destination in a very professional manner.While flying back to ZZZ1; I looked at the reports section of the FOM to review what I need to write and discovered that I should have had a verbal debrief with both the Chief Pilot and Dispatch. I believe I had assumed I had spoken to all the right personnel since I had spoken to flight ops personnel; maintenance personnel; and had accepted my new dispatch release from Dispatch; but apparently was incorrect upon reviewing the FOM.After walking in my door from this trip; I checked my email and saw the following from Name; the ZZZ tech ops supervisor previously mentioned.

I notified ATC at that time that we were dealing with a hydraulic issue and would be returning to ZZZ. I asked for delay vectors which ATC provided me. I continued to fly while my First Officer complied with the ECAM actions; which we both confirmed. ECAM directed us to shut down the Yellow hydraulic pump and the PTU; which we did. My First Officer then went into the QRH for extra malfunction information and to compute our required landing distance.

I then notified Dispatch and Maintenance over ACARS of our malfunction and our intent to return to ZZZ. I also notified Maintenance over the ZZZ Company maintenance frequency to inform them of our return. We got delay vectors while we performed all these actions. Dispatch sent us landing data and agreed with our intent to return to ZZZ. I then formally requested priority handling with ATC and gave souls on board and fuel and our desire to land on Runway XXR since it was the longest runway available and we had lost some spoiler panels and an engine reverser due to the hydraulic system failure. I also asked for the fire trucks to be present in case of any hydraulic fluid leakage or further incident on landing. I then called the flight attendants back and gave the full brief. The flight attendants were calm; cool and collected during this entire situation and performed remarkably. All emergency action items and briefs were complied with and my First Officer and I agreed with our plan to land back at ZZZ. We both discussed the situation and tried to brainstorm if there was anything that we were missing and there was not. We discussed that the ECAM stated if the overheat indication went away we could renegade the yellow hydraulic system. We discussed that if the overheat went away we would reengage the yellow system at 1;000 ft. AGL for the landing. At approximately 12;000 ft. on the descent the overheat indication went out; yet the fluid system level was still at the maximum level. We planned for a longer final approach since our flaps and slats were operating slower than normal. At 1;000 ft. AGL we reengaged the yellow system; as per the ECAM; since the overheat condition no longer existed. I landed the aircraft uneventfully back into ZZZ on Runway XXR with 16;000 ft. available. We were able to clear the runway uneventfully and did not notice any further yellow system hydraulic overheat. We did notice on taxi in that the yellow hydraulic system fluid level was jumping rapidly from the maximum allowed level to the normal fill line; and back and forth. Once at the gate we spoke with Maintenance and informed them of what we had seen and experienced. They then decided to take the airplane to the hangar for more maintenance troubleshooting.

I advised the Chief Pilot that myself and the First Officer were no longer fit to fly and she had scheduling book us on a deadhead back to base. The Chief Pilot a did an excellent job; was very pleasant and helpful and took care of us very well. I was very impressed. My First Officer and I conducted a facilitated debrief and felt that we performed well during this emergency and did everything we could do to ensure a positive outcome.

We landed without incident and had Operations 1 and Fire/rescue look over the plane; then taxied to the gate.I think we handled the emergency well; especially with the all the distractions from ATC; warning horn with gear up and flaps stuck at 15 after go-around; and shifting winds on final.",,"We were on a visual final to ZZZ Runway XXC with the First Officer as PF (Pilot Flying). After selecting flaps to 30; we noticed the Trailing Edge Flap Indicator still indicated Flaps 15. We executed a go-around. Per our go-around call outs; the flap handle was brought to 15; then 5. We then noted the flap indicator still indicated 15.While being vectored for another visual approach to Runway 1C; I ran the Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree Checklist. The First Officer put the autopilot back on and maintained 185 KIAS to stay below the Flaps 15 limit speed.Before our turn to Final; I requested priority handling with ZZZZ Approach; telling them we had 5;800 lbs of fuel (approximately 58 minutes) and XXX souls on board. I made a quick PA to the passengers. Also; I let the flight attendants know we were returning for a normal landing with a flap problem. Per the QRH; we made an uneventful Flaps 15 visual approach and landing. The First Officer did the landing. An ELB report was made once we were at the gate.I believe we handled the event pretty well. The FO (First Officer) and I had great communication. The First Officer also did well with automation management which greatly helped with the workload. I did not notify Dispatch or Maintenance in the air since we wanted to complete our checklist and land in a timely fashion. Looking back; I should have used the [checklist] sequence with my communication with the flight attendants. I conveyed the information to them; but I know using the checklist would insure that we are all on the same page.",,"B737 NG reported a go-around caused by flaps failing to extend to the commanded position.

We waited a few seconds and a second blue ECAM directed us to turn CTR TANK 2 off and open the XFEED; which we did. We pulled up the fuel page and noticed a 1;400 pound imbalance which is also normal. We continued watching the fuel page and noticed the imbalance rapidly getting worse. We consulted the FM to fuel imbalance and followed the procedure; which was to turn tank 1 off; open XFEED and tank 2 should balance out tank one. The fuel imbalance started increasing at a rapid rate. Tank 2 went UP in fuel while tank one was falling rapidly; now approaching 3;000 pounds lower. I called Dispatch and had him connect me with M/C (Maintenance Control). M/C did not have a solution that we had not already tried. Suspecting a fuel leak; we made the decision to divert to ZZZ. I notified the passengers and flight attendants and we diverted to ZZZ. The fuel imbalance continued to get worse and the autopilot eventually had 3.2 degrees of right rudder in with left bank to keep us flying straight and level. We landed ZZZ and requested ARFF assistance to verify we did not have a fuel leak before taxing to the gate.",,"During cruise flight we received an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) from low pressure from one of the center tank pumps. The tank was at 40 pounds so we believed the message would disappear however it did not. We proceeded to run the ECAM and at the conclusion we identified a 1;400 lbs fuel imbalance which is not abnormal. However; this fuel imbalance rapidly increased approaching our structural limitations. The Captain initiated the fuel imbalance QRH procedure after consulting the FM and communicated with M/C (Maintenance Control). M/C did not have any suggestions we had not attempted. We investigated whether this could be a false reading but determined it was a true imbalance due to the aircraft slowly entering a small bank with rudder trim while in level flight. Due to a possibility of a fuel leak; the aircraft uncoordinated flight condition and the uncorrectable fuel imbalance the captain elected to divert to ZZZ. We landed uneventfully in ZZZ and had ground ops trucks inspect the aircraft for a fuel leak before continuing to our gate.

We verified what indication we had and I called for the QRH Checklist. After we completed that; I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them and Maintenance know our issue. As we continued we did notice a decrease in the A System quantity; but the pressure remained steady. Around 40 minutes later; the B System Engine Driven pump Low Pressure light also illuminated. I called for and we ran the same checklist for the Low Pressure light. We continued to have normal system pressure on the hydraulic pressure gauges so we decided to continue the flight. I instructed the First Officer to send another ACARS message to Dispatch; which he did.At this point; we ran through some possible scenarios and began to prepare for an A System failure. We input data for a normal and A System failure landing into the Weight and Balance. Then we discussed what might happen; once we started to put a higher load on the hydraulic system; such as lowering the gear and flaps; using thrust reverse and nose wheel steering. It became apparent to us that while we were operating normally; our situation could change rapidly. It was at this point we decided to advise ATC and proceed directly to ZZZ. We notified ATC of our hydraulic malfunction and our intention to go directly to our destination. I then asked the First Officer to notify Dispatch of our request for priority handling. He did via ACARS. I contacted the Flight Attendants and briefed them on what we planned to be a normal landing; but that we had requested priority handling and to expect to see the CFR vehicles near the runway.I also briefed the Passengers about the same situation. ATC cleared us direct to the airport and we started our descent. During the Approach Briefing; we had discussed configuring early to allow time for the electric pump gear and flap extension. Those worked as expected and we maintained normal pressure on the hydraulic gauges. The landing was normal. Thrust reverse and spoiler extension operated normally with the slightest of flicker from the Electric Pump Low Pressure lights as mentioned in the QRH. I even had normal nose wheel steering. We cleared the runway and I asked that CFR inspect the aircraft for any visible leaks. They saw none; so we continued to the gate in ZZZ.

I was a dead heading pilot sitting in [seat] X. I was called to the cockpit by the Captain whom I flew with during the course of this 4 day trip. In addition; I was PM (Pilot Monitoring) on Aircraft X; ZZZ-ZZZZ. I have flown the Airbus [for many years] for various carriers. In addition [to] being a Line Pilot; Captain and First Officer; I have also been an instructor [for] Airbus.  The Captain felt that I could be of use to his very well qualified crew as a third member in the cockpit. Let me be clear to say that the First Officer; the PF (Pilot Flying); was a former [other Airline] pilot who had thousands of hours of experience. The Captain had well over 5;000 hours in the seat. My role in the event was support alone. When the FA (Flight Attendant) came back to inform me that the Captain requested my presence in the flight deck; I knew what that meant. I grabbed my IPad and proceeded to the cockpit. Once inside; the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) told me everything system wise and the PFD indicated that the crew was in Alternate Law. The FO (First Officer) was hand flying the aircraft and we were at FL260. I took my place in the jump seat and asked how I could be of assistance. The Captain passed the radio comms to me while the FO flew. It's one thing to fly around at 5;000 ft. while demonstrating Alternate Law and it's quite another to be fully immersed in an aircraft that is making uncommanded movements via pitch; be in turbulence at FL260; all while speaking with ZZZZ Air Traffic Controllers. The PF was doing a great job. I took Com 1. The Captain was trying the [to] contact Dispatch/Maintenance control via the crew phone but was having trouble with 2 way cutting out. I went to the FOM and provided him with ARINC (Commercial Radio) freq to call ZZZ1 radio. While he was doing that; I was speaking with ATC; coordinating descent and making inputs to the FCU (Fuel Control Unit). Again; the FO was very actively flying the aircraft and doing a great job. I then focused on systems. The overhead indications were 'lights out' which ordinarily would mean the flight control computers were working. Except the ECAM said they weren't. I then pushed the F/CTL page and all indications were green. Again; would look normal. Except something was happening because clearly we were in alternate law. I researched QRH for a reset but it was for On Ground Only. There was no reset. I then looked in Comply AOM for information. I also referenced the QRH within Comply. The Captain was very busy; the FO was busy flying; I am doing the radios and referencing manuals. In addition; my role is simply support so at appropriate times I informed the CA (Captain)/FO about what they had systems wise and what was going to happen systems and performance wise when we degraded to Direct law. Referred to the NNP (Non Normal Performance) pages of QRH; did their landing distance computation; and also reminded the crew that when determining Vapp to make corrections off of flaps full speed before selecting flaps 3. Captain requested backup for non routine landing considerations. At all times he was in command and my role was to have the appropriate manuals out and ready for when he requested. This crew was also dealing with the normal communication issues facing every crew on every flight. Task saturation; communication barriers; airspace closures related to military airspace requiring the crew to NOT be able to proceed directly to the divert airport; dark and turbulent versus dark and stormy; communication barriers with ATC; and balancing the need to follow the ECAM with the need to reference other manuals. In addition; at least 2 times the cockpit crew was interrupted by communication not from the number 1 FA (Flight Attendant) but from the rear flight attendants. They meant well but their concerns weren't relevant and not helpful.  This crew did a great jobmanaging the serious issues and I was happy to assist. On final I did suggest configuring to flaps 3; on speed; before gear down command since the plane would be trimmed already making it easier on the FO to fly. He did a great job.Please put the ARINC freq map back in the QRH. Please tab the QRH although I tab mine myself.",,,,"A319 Pilot reported loss of both ELACs while at cruise and assisted the Flight Crew in handling the situation.

Start up through take off were normal. When the Captain raised the gear after takeoff; he noticed a Master Caution FLT CONT light flicker on; then immediately off. At a safer altitude; we both looked around more and found no abnormal indications; so we continued the departure to ZZZ2. In cruise at FL 400; the #1 engine driven hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. The QRH led us to turn off that pump.

This time the QRH directed a #1 engine shutdown. We transferred aircraft control to the Captain; [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Approach; requested and received extra vectors for time from Approach; completed the QRH Checklist for engine shutdown and single engine landing; and landed flaps 15. Landing and taxi to the gate were otherwise normal. By the time we set the parking brake at the gate; #1 hydraulic quantity; as I recall; showed 37% RF (Re Fill).

I did not notice the correlation to the auto throttle and the #2 N1; however; and neither of us noticed any other abnormalities in performance or indications. The autothrottle has disengaged in the past during takeoff or climb out; so this did not seem unusual at first. CRM: The Captain delegated tasks; but a couple of times we both answered or duplicated radio calls. We were methodical to ensure we were performing the appropriate checklists as this was an unusual situation. The term 'Engine Limit' as part of the title was not readily apparent as applicable; but we realized the first line in the Condition Statement is 'Engine Indications are abnormal'. We had already applied the Immediate Action items through our analysis and stabilization of the aircraft and the QRC does not call for any additional actions. We also determined that this checklist concluded at Step X with the engine at reduced thrust and coordination with Maintenance Control and Dispatch. In the checklist; communication errors and imperfect systems knowledge resulted in some confusion over brake setting for landing but was resolved. Finally; task management required split-task effort and re-brief; adding to the challenge; but we had plenty of time to verify all necessary items before entering the traffic pattern for landing at ZZZ.",,"B737 flight crew reported an engine failure after take off; resulting in an air turnback and precautionary landing at the departure airport.",

Roles:Captain: Pilot Monitoring (PM)First Officer (FO): Pilot Flying (PF)Deadhead FO: DH PilotAt approximately XA:20 while approaching way point ZZZZZ on Airway at FL380 the autopilot #2 disengaged with an associated ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF. After an evaluation and finding no cause for the autopilot disengagement the autopilot #2 was re-engaged. Within minutes the aircraft pitched up slightly; as if in mountain wave; climbing approximately 70 ft. above the cruise altitude and an ECAM message F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 displayed. The aircraft then slightly pitched down to 70 ft. below cruise altitude and immediately ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF; F/CTL ALT LAW (PROT LOST) and F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 2 displayed. Pilot Flying began hand flying the aircraft. We began the ECAM Procedures. I called the #1 Flight Attendant and instructed him to have the deadheading First Officer come to the cockpit immediately. Deadhead Pilot and I re-evaluated the systems failures and determined that the systems/computers could not be recovered. I then [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and requested FL260 since we could not stay in RSVM airspace without an autopilot. This also allowed a wider airspeed regime between Vmo and Alfa PROT in case pitch control became more of problem. Pilot Flying noted that the control input forces were increasing as we descended at 280 kt. indicated. We attempted to manually trim the aircraft with the pitch trim wheel; but the stabilizer appeared jammed at -0.8 up. I attempted to call Dispatch desk via the Crew Call app but reception was poor. Deadhead pilot looked up the ZZZ Commercial Radio frequency for me and I established communication with the Dispatcher and Airbus Maintenance desk. Maintenance advised us that if there was not a fix in the QRH there was nothing he could do for us. The aircraft was under control and Pilot Flying was able to override the now mistrimmed stabilizer with his side stick. The three of us and the Dispatcher then began discussions on diverting to the closest long runway. Something in the 8;000 to 10;000 ft. length range with airspace enough to configure; evaluate and handle any pitch problems that may present itself as we configured for landing. The four of use decided it was prudent to divert to ZZZ1 which was 140 NM away (120 miles closer than ZZZ2).I [requested priority handling] and informed ZZZZ Center that we were experiencing a flight control problem and request vectors to ZZZ1. ZZZZ gave us an off-airway vectors of 090deg then 100deg so to fly around restricted airspace while ZZZZ called for permission for use to fly through the restricted airspace direct to ZZZ1. I asked Deadhead Pilot to handle the radio communications while I briefed the flight attendant and passengers on the diversion and anticipated non-routine landing. The flight attendants were briefed for a non-routine landing. When done with cabin briefings and passenger address my attention returned to Pilot Flying and Deadhead Pilot. By this time; we had been handed off to ZZZ Center. I found that we were still flying the 100 degree heading. I queried ZZZ Center for the reason of this extended vector and was told it was because of restricted airspace to our north. I firmly reminded the Controller we were an aircraft in distress with flight control problem [and] that we had [requested priority handling] and if this vector continues; we're going to have fuel problems. I informed him this diversion was becoming pointless since the object of the diversion was to get this aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. I added that I could have been in ZZZ3 by now. We were immediately given a north heading towards ZZZ2.Approximately 20 minutes before landing passing 15;000 ft. (SAT-26) the pitch trimwheel lurched nose down a few inches and began trimming normally. Pilot Flying commented that side stick input forces became normal. The stabilizer continued to trim normally during all speed and configurations changes as flaps were extended. The ECAM messages remained displayed. Deadhead Pilot had completed a landing distance assessment using a non-normal; DIRECT LAW calculation. (Note: A non-normal; stabilizer jam calculation resulted in the same distance) We asked for and received a 20 NM final approach. We completed our applicable checklists and informed the Flight Attendants that we were 10 minutes from landing.Pilot Flying; Deadhead Pilot and I briefed that we would be fully configured and 160 kts. prior to gear extension so that only small a small amount of pitch trim would be required to stabilize the approach when the flight control system degrades to DIRECT LAW. Pilot Flying landed the aircraft perfectly and we rolled out; turned off the runway to taxi to the gate. Pilot Flying commented the aircraft required a firmer side stick input to flare due to the Direct Mode. I made a passenger address assuring them of our safety and thanking them for their cooperation with the Flight Attendant's instruction.I met with the Mechanic meeting our flight and briefed him on our experienced. He was grateful we had stayed to discuss the failures with him. When we blocked in and shut down the engines all the ECAM messages had cleared and only an ECAM Class II F/CTL indication remained. The faults remained in the Multipurpose Control Display Unit>Maintenance>Current Flight Report print out. Deadhead Pilot and I had operated Aircraft X/DATE that morning down to ZZZZ1. Starting the initial decent on the ZZZZZ1 2A STAR into ZZZZ1 we had experienced three autopilot disconnects. The first two occurred prior to the way point ZZZZZ3 on the STAR. ZZZZZ3 was to be crossed between FL230 and FL210. Prior to the third disconnect I saw the pitch trim wheel jerk forward approximately an inch. An ECAM warning would flash on the display then disappear. Descending below FL180 the autopilot was re-engaged and was used for the remainder of the STAR and RWY XXR LOC and GS capture. The pitch trim worked normally as we slowed on the arrival and configured for landing.At gate arrival in ZZZZ1; we called for Maintenance and described what we experienced. Maintenance printed a Maintenance Current Flight Report from the Multipurpose Control Display Unit which indicated warns of XU:23 AUTO FLT AP OFF and XU:27 F/CTL. Failure messages were: XU:21 AFS:ELAC1 and XU:25 AFS:ELAC1. There was a Class II Maintenance Message F/CTL displayed on the Status page. Maintenance went to work clearing these faults.I could not have hopped for a better qualified crew to meet this challenge. I had flown with Deadhead Pilot before; but this was my first flight with Pilot Flying. Deadhead Pilot brought 30 years of Airbus experience to the flight deck including time at various airlines. Pilot Flying brought 22 years of Airbus experience to the flight. Their performance was both profession and stellar. They never stopped working the problem. Flight Attendant 1; Flight Attendant 3; Flight Attendant 4 worked as a team preparing our passengers for a non-routine landing and keeping communications to the cockpit to a minimum during this diversion allowing us to work the problem uninterrupted. I would recommend that Dispatch and Commercial Radio VHF frequency pages found in the FOM be included in the QRH for easier referencing.",,,,"Pilot reported ELAC failure at cruise.

Shortly thereafter; on the initial descent into ZZZ1; we got a LOW PRESSURE caution for the ENG 2 Hydraulic Pump on System B. We again ran the same QRH procedure and switched off that hydraulic pump. Even though the electric pumps were maintaining full hydraulic pressure; we were concerned that we had a limited amount of time before significant functional degradation of our hydraulic systems began; particularly with the fluid loss on System A.

Autopilot 2; Auto Thrust; First Officer Primary Flight Display; Navigation Display; and lower Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor were all failed. I took controls and Comms while First Officer commenced Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor actions. Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors displayed in order: Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio Mode fault; AC Bus 2 fail; DC Bus 2 fail; Gen 2 fault; NAV LS tuning disagree. I engaged Auto Pilot 1; while manually adjusting thrust. I performed a radio check with ATC and informed them we were dealing with an electrical fault; however no assistance was required. Lead Flight Attendant called to inform us all power and lights were out in the cabin.When [the] First Officer performed Gen 2 fault Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor; the Gen Reset; and we regained AC and DC bus 2. We realized then we had experienced a Gen 2 Trip and the Bus Tie had not worked; resulting in the loss of two main busses. The Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio MODE fault did not clear. We attempted the published FM reset for this malfunction and it did not work. With [the] situation stabilized; First Officer took controls back; and we agreed to descend to FL 310 per FM guidance to improve APU start capability. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control while [the] First Officer coordinated altitude change for APU start.At this point Gen 2 failed again; however; this time; the bus tie operated correctly and we did not lose AC and DC bus2. Gen 1 powered all busses except normal galley shed. Reset of Gen 2 did not work this time. The First Officer descended to FL310 and started the APU. Bus tie worked and APU Gen successfully powered right side of electrical system. First Officer climbed aircraft back to FL350 to exit a layer of IMC at FL310. Finally able to consult with Maintenance Control after the latest Gen fault; they confirmed from their report downloads what we assessed from all of the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor cautions.They asked us to attempt another reset of the Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio mode; which was unsuccessful. We operated the remainder of the flight with both engines in N1 degraded mode. Maintenance Control opined that; although the electrical system was currently powered; there were questions about the efficacy of the bus tie system; and any subsequent potential electrical faults made it prudent to not continue flight to ZZZ1; but rather stop short. Flight crew and Dispatch agreed. Dispatch mentioned ZZZ2; which we had just passed. First Officer and I felt it was just as safe to continue to ZZZ3.By the time we could perform all of our briefs and planning we we would be descending to ZZZ3 and we were about 45 [to] 50 minutes away. The weather was good; and it would be better for our passengers and maintenance. Maintenance Control and Dispatch agreed that a divert to ZZZ3 was a great option. I took the controls back; the First Officer coordinated clearance to ZZZ3 via the ZZZZZ arrival. We did not request priority. We conducted a visual approach and uneventful landing to Runway XXC at ZZZ3.",,"I was the Pilot Flying on Aircraft X ZZZ [to] ZZZ1. We had just leveled off at our final altitude about 25 minutes after take-off. The Captain had just made a PA announcement turning off the seat belt signs. We agreed to go to speaker and as I switch my loud speaker on; I heard a power swap and I lost my (First Officer side) Primary Flight Display; Navigation Display; and the System Display screens. We immediately transferred the flight controls to the Captain and determined the Autopilot and Autothrust were off. We had multiple Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors and the Flight Attendants where buzzing us up front. We briefly discussed that the Captain would fly; take the radios; and I would work the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors.The Flight Attendants started pounding on the Flight Deck door. Captain buzzed the Purser who informed us that the Cabin had gone completely dark. He told her we were working on it and would get back to her. I started completing the blue to do items on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor. It seemed like we had a cascading amount of Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors. From the best of my memory the order of the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors were: Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio Mode Fault; Electrical DC Bus 2 Fault; Electrical AC Bus 2 Fault; Electrical Gen 2 Fault (At this point the generator came back online); Auto FLT Facility 2 Fault; NAV LS Tuning Disagree; and lastly Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Reporting Fault.When I had completed the above Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors and got to the Status Page; we had the following Status (Attachment 1): Eng 2 N1 Degraded Mode; Center TK Fuel UNUSABLE. We had the following INOP Systems: Auto Throttle; Category 2 Center TK PUMPS. At this point we did "Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor complete screens normal." The Captain checked in with the Flight Attendants and determined that power was restored in the cabin. The Captain made an announcement to the Passengers explaining that we had an electrical issue but have resolved it. The Captain and I then discussed what exactly we had lost since most of the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors had gone away or fixed themselves. We started back in the Quick Reference Handbook to read the Notes/Warnings/Cautions on the items we recalled on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor.At this point; [we] decided that we had Engine Pressure Ratio Mode Fault and resulting Generator fault which resets normally; but for some reason; the left side did not properly pick up the electrical load. We made a decision to continue since the Gen was reset and decided to consult with Maintenance Control further. The Captain and I exchanged flight controls back to me and then he started coordinating with dispatch to get a VHF patch with Maintenance Control. As Maintenance Control was coming on the line; we had another Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor pop up: ELECTRICAL Gen 2 Fault. Captain completed the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor; and this time the reset was unsuccessful. Captain and I both decided for peace of mind the get the APU running and have it as a backup generator. We briefly discussed the APU start limits; and decided the descend to 31000 ft. in order to better guarantee a start. While Captain troubleshot with Maintenance Control and Dispatch; I requested a descent to 31000 ft. and started the APU. While this was all happening; we had been traversing an area of weather below us. We ended up right near the tops at 31000 ft.; and we decided to climb back up to 35000 ft. for a better ride and less chance of a need for anti-ice while making a determination of diverting or not. After the Captain had determined with Maintenance Control that Gen 2 was completely busted we (Dispatch; Maintenance Control; Flight Crew) were all in agreement to divert instead of continue to ZZZ1. At this point in the flight; we were about 45 minutes fromZZZ3. With the weather below us and ZZZ3 VFR we decided on diverting to ZZZ3. I requested clearance from ATC to ZZZ3 while the Captain briefed the Flight Attendants and passengers. The Captain and I discussed whether to request priority handling at this point. We had come across nothing in the Quick Reference Handbook or Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors that suggested a sense of urgently to request priority. We had completed the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors and had an extra generator with the APU. We elected not to request priority and just continue normally with the divert to ZZZ3. We exchanged the flight controls again and the Captain was Pilot Flying and I was Pilot Monitoring. The approach and landing were uneventful and we were greeted at ZZZ3 by Maintenance.

The inbound crew had experienced an ELAC1 fault in cruise late in the flight which resolved to normal operations somewhere in the descent. I was deadheading in the cabin on the inbound flight and was advised of the ELAC issue at the gate where I took the place of the FO (First Officer) who operated the inbound flight. He was illegal for the leg back to ZZZ1 and took a seat in the cabin to deadhead back to ZZZ1. Maintenance was advised of the issue on the inbound flight and Mechanics came onboard to evaluate. No remaining problems were found and the aircraft was deemed safe for flight. Departure; climb and initial cruise at FL380 were normal until about two hours into the flight. First we got an ELAC1 pitch trim fault and automatic autopilot disconnect. There were no ECAM actions to perform and we reengaged the autopilot. While analyzing the effect of the failure we got an ELAC2 pitch trim fault and the autopilot disconnected once again. The Captain requested a descent from ZZZZ Center as we were no longer RVSM compliant and then he called the 1st FA (Flight Attendant) and requested the deadheading FO be sent to the cockpit. Having the extra crew member in the cockpit was very helpful as he assisted with the radios; systems research and a variety of other tasks. I was hand flying the descent to FL260 and then FL240 due to turbulence while the three of us discussed our options. Although the display said to use manual trim; the trim wheel was frozen in place and could not be adjusted. Control pressure in pitch was light and even though we had no pitch trim available; hand flying the aircraft was not difficult. At this point we were in alternate law and even though control was not difficult; hand flying the aircraft required constant adjustments and was significantly touchier than hand flying a fully functional aircraft. The Captain attempted to contact Maintenance but was unsuccessful. We decided the situation warranted [an alert] and since ZZZ2 appeared significantly closer we decided to divert. After further discussion of our frozen pitch trim we decided advising ATC was appropriate. En route to ZZZ2 we were given lengthy vectors around military airspace which was unexpected since we had requested priority handling.

I asked the FA (Flight Attendant) if they were experiencing the same thing and was told that they could still smell the musty; sweaty socks odor but no eye irritation. At that point I suggested that we wait a few minutes to see if the odor dissipates thinking that it may just be some moisture in the AC system that would burn off. After about five minutes I called all flight attendant stations for an update and I asked for a consensus on whether the odor was getting better or worse or staying the same. All the FA's agreed that the odor seemed to be subsiding and they were OK with proceeding to ZZZ1. It was then when FO stated that he could still smell the odor and that he was developing a headache. At that point I decided that we needed to return to ZZZ. After [advising ATC] we were cleared direct to ZZZ and we started our descent; notified Dispatch and ZZZ operation; completed all applicable check lists; QRH procedures and the over weight landing assessment. We touched down on Runway XXC in ZZZ at a weight of 188;800 lbs at 155 IAS and taxied to the gate uneventfully. At the gate all passengers were deplaned and I made the appropriate logbook entries in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook. The flight attendants were met by someone who I believed to be an in flight Supervisor and were escorted off the jet way by them. FO and myself were the last two off the aircraft and when we reached the gate area; the flight attendants and the in flight Supervisor were nowhere to be seen.",,"Last minute schedule change to ZZZ1. Arrived at mostly boarded aircraft (roughly 170 passenger). External power had failed. APU off; No external power; No external air. FAs (Flight Attendant's) had stopped boarding and were discussing deplaning when we arrived. First noticed a slight 'locker room' smell at that time. We believed it was a result of the high temp in the cabin with the passengers; in addition to the +TSRA and gusty winds in the area. Started APU and continued as normal. No increase in smell during APU or engine start. Climbing through 8;000 ft. FA called the flight deck stating a passenger was reporting a strong electrical burning and musty/dirty sock smell in addition to eye irritation. Captain and FA's believed it was OK to continue but they'd monitor the situation to see if it improved. About 10 minutes later it had become strong enough I was able to notice more and had developed a headache and suggested we return to ZZZ. Captain agreed and we [advised ATC]. CA (Captain) assumed PF (Pilot Flying) duties and radio. I accomplished applicable QRH procedures; check lists; and landing assessment. Returned to ZZZ for an overweight landing. Cancelled priority request on the ground. Deplaned at gate with no injuries or anyone requesting medical attention.Maintenance issue. Possible rain water in combination with other fluids pooled around heated or electrical components in the body of the fuselage. We didn't initially believe it was the aircraft producing the smell/fumes since it was purely on emergency battery power when we first arrived at the aircraft.Uncertain. Would need to know the cause of the smell/fumes.",,"Air Carrier flight crew reported a fume event during climb described as musty 'locker room' odor.

The Captain was the Flying Pilot. When he returned from the second break it; was noted that the left engine oil quantity had been dropping. The left engine oil quantity had dropped from 7 to 3 in the matter of about 30 minutes. The oil pressure and temperature was remaining consistent at 196 psi and 110 degrees. Since there is not a procedure for low quantity; the Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to advise of the situation. See if they could see and monitor engine parameters and to discuss then next step if the quantity did in fact reach zero. He advised to monitor. The Crew discussed possible diversion airports and weather. The FM and QRH were referenced for the appropriate checklist and procedures if the engine oil parameters deteriorated. The left engine oil quantity did in fact reach zero and I began keeping track of the engine parameters for trends. The engine went to zero quantity at XA:27. The engine oil pressure and temperature remained consistent for 25 minutes. At this point we had left the tracks; in radar contact with ZZZZ and been given clearance for ZZZZZ direct ZZZ. Once the oil pressure began to drop and it became apparent it was not a quantity sensor issue the Flight Attendant was called to provide a restroom break; be given a heads up briefing and asked to wake the Pilot Monitoring First Officer.While waiting for the third Pilot to return to the flight deck; Dispatch and Maintenance were consulted. During this communication; the engine oil pressure light began to flicker. Within minutes; the oil pressure was boxed and red on the engine indicators. Knowing that the QRH for L Eng oil pressure led to an inflight shutdown; the Captain discussed diversion with Dispatch. The third Pilot returned to the flight deck. He began the QRH procedures. I advised the lead Flight Attendant of the situation and provided the briefing items. I then made an announcement to the people. Once we were vectored to ZZZZ1 I provided the Flight Attendants and the passengers and updated time of landing. Also advised passengers why the lights went out momentarily during the transfer of power to the app. The QRH and landing distance computations were completed. A flaps 20 ILS was planned for ZZZZ1. Emergency equipment were in place and standing by. The weather was VFR clouds and visibility. Winds favored the runway but were gusty. Approximately 260 at 24 gusting 35. Appropriate adjustments were made to VREF.Landing was in the touchdown zone. Rollout and stop were as expected with the single thrust reverser and wind gust. The aircraft completed a 180 at the end of the runway and exited at taxiway Alpha. Emergency equipment followed and inspected the aircraft. Once entering the temp area the left truck break temperature had risen. The aircraft was stopped. The Fire Chief advised they saw fire. They sprayed and extinguished the fire. The Brake Temperature Monitoring System (BTMS) Checklist was completed and 1 hour was needed before moving aircraft again. I advised the Flight Attendant and passengers. The Flight Attendants decided to use that hour to serve the passengers breakfast. I communicated with Operations on plan for the passengers and aircraft.Once time was complete. The Aircraft was towed to the gate and met by Mechanics and Ground Security Coordinator.",,"During my rest period; I was awakened by Flight Attendant and told to return to flight deck. When I entered the flight deck the Captain and Relief Pilot informed me that oil quantity was zero and engine shut down impending. [Requested priority handling] with ZZZZ and vectored to ZZZZ1. We started the Drift down and Engine failure/shut down check lists. We descended incrementally while switching to approach. During the descent we accomplished communications with dispatch; reviewed diversion checklists; and calculated landing distance in the Non-normal landing configuration chart. Approach vectored us for an ILS to Runway XX at ZZZZ1. Approach and landing were uneventful. We touched down and rolled to the end of the runway; performed a 180 and received taxi instructions to stand 42. While on the taxiway the Brake Temperature light illuminated and we stopped. We performed the Brake Temp checklist and determined the brake cooling time; and asked the fire/rescue to chock the aircraft. The fire/rescue unit informed us we had a 'bogie' and applied firefighting agent. We continued to hold until the required cooling time expired. After the brakes cooled we taxied to the stand; deplaned passengers and secured the aircraft.",,"B767 flight crew reported they shut down one engine due to loss of oil pressure; diverted to the nearest airport; and after landing with one engine; the rear brakes caught fire which was extinguished by airport personnel.",

Dispatch seemed to immediately know that something wasn't right and we responded to their message confirming an air return. We notified the Flight Attendants first; then the passengers telling them exactly what had happened and why we were returning to Denver.We did not request priority handling but ATC began to refer to us as a critical aircraft so we went with that assuming that they had declared priority handling for us. We made an uneventful smooth overweight landing. There were multiple emergency vehicles lined along the runway as we landed. Logbook entries were made for both the cracked windshield; and the overweight landing specifying the smooth landing and a brakes-on speed of 65 kts.

Shortly after departure; we were cleared direct ZZZZZ and climb to FL210. About 6000 ft. MSL; the First Officer; Pilot Flying; began adding rudder trim. A few seconds later; the auto-throttles disengaged and the aircraft began to increase yaw. We looked at the number 2 engine instruments and saw N1 gauge about 55 percent and Fuel Flow around 3000 pounds per hour. EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) were normal. We leveled off at 9000 ft. and began to assess the situation. The amber ENG FAIL annunciator appeared on the upper Display Unit. I called for the Engine Failure Checklist in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). I requested priority handling with ZZZ departure and requested radar vectors while we ran checklists. We notified Dispatch; through ZZZ Operations; communicated with the Flight Attendants and notified the passengers that we were returning to ZZZ for a mechanical issue. Landing data was acquired; one engine inoperative flaps 15 landing. Auto Brakes 3 were selected. Once landing data and the Engine Failure Checklist was complete; up to the one Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist; the First Officer transferred the controls to me for the landing. Flaps 15 landing was made uneventful. We stopped the aircraft in order to have ARF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) assess the condition of the aircraft and run brake cooling numbers. We were given the all clear by ARF. Brake cooling allowed us to taxi to the gate. Maintenance met the aircraft and a logbook entry was made. After aircraft was deplaned; I had a conference call with the Chief Pilot on call; Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and Manager.",,"Departed ZZZ1 on Aircraft X at (time) on (date) via the ZZZZZ Departure; Runway XXL with myself acting as PF (Pilot Flying). [It was an] uneventful take-off and received vectors towards [the] ZZZZZ intersection and eventually direct to ZZZZZ. While climbing through about 6000 ft.; the aircraft felt as if it needed rudder adjustment. As I began to adjust the rudder; I noticed that the number 2 engine had rolled back to about 55 percent N1. We immediately started to analyze the situation utilizing CRM. Within seconds; the autothrottle kicked off and the engine continued to operate at reduced N1. EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) showed normal position. At about the same time; the engine failed and Captain Name called for the Engine Failure Checklist. We coordinated that he would run the checklist and I would continue to fly the aircraft. We had leveled off at 9000 ft. and at this point; requested to turn back towards ZZZ1 and descend. We were approved to descend to 5000 ft. and vectored toward ZZZ1. Captain coordinated with ZZZ1 Departure for time and vectors to run our required checklists; as well as providing them with fuel and souls on board information. We continued through the checklist as we were vectored through final for Runway XYR. Completed the checklist as well as getting landing data and determining that we would not be an overweight landing. Discussed single-engine go-around procedures in addition for the need to calculate hot-brake numbers after landing. Turned back towards the extended center line for Runway XYR and descended. During this time frame; Captain called to inform and coordinate with the FA's (Flight Attendant); creating an excellent shared mental model.Received vectors for intercepting the localizer; while configuring for our flaps 15 landing.

At this point brought Purser into the loop and I made the decision to ZZZ1. Purser returned to cabin to brief crew and run precautionary landing check list I made a preparatory brief to passengers. ZZZZZ Dispatch to confirm plan to ZZZ1. Dispatch calculated our fuel dump and return fuel for landing. Notified ATC of our intentions to dump fuel and request priority handling and return to ZZZ1. ATC turned us south and away from weather. At XB:22Z we began to dump 65;500 pounds of fuel; IAH 090/80nm FL330. Fuel dump time 27 minutes. ATC gave us a turn to the west and descent to FL300.

ZZZ1 ARFF remained with the aircraft until we were towed to gate. In congruence with ZZZ1 ARFF terminated priority handling with ZZZ1 Tower at XD:35Z.We were reluctant to dump the fuel and actually considered in the ZZZZZ three way with Dispatch and maintenance to continue on to MAD. However; when including Purser into the loop; who has actually first hand knowledge with vision of the physical condition of the passengers we were carrying- first thing Purser asked? No problem with this aircraft getting into alternate for a medical divert? Our ALTNs were OK but not great. Decision was made there to ZZZ1.

Contacted Dispatch and discussed tire press issue and options. We discussed the options: to ZZZ1 or continue. Then CA asked Purser to come to the flight deck to discuss her concerns. We had concerns about continuing to ZZZ2 with diversion options with a flat tire and Purser was concerned with diversion for passenger medical priority. We discussed how would need to request priority handling no matter where we landed. We also discussed fatigue being a factor if we brought the priority to ZZZ2 vs landing ZZZ without the fatigue factor. We all agreed that ZZZ was the safest option for dealing with the flat tire on landing. We requested priority handling with ZZZ3 ATC and advised we needed to jettison fuel. We were then given vectors over the Gulf of Mexico where we began fuel jettison procedures at FL330. Once fuel jettison was complete and weight was below max landing weight we were given vectors back to ZZZ. We requested ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) on arrival at ZZZ. Approach and landing was uneventful. ARFF informed us that we did have a flat but intact tire and requested left engine to be shut down for closer inspection. ARFF gave us all clear and CA taxied clear of runway. We requested a tow in from that point to gate. Once at the gate; the priority handling was terminated and PAX and crew deplaned normally. I was the relief pilot on this trip. The CA did a great job of asking for our input as well as the Pursers input. We discussed pros and cons of continuing to ZZZ2.

Flaps ceased to move beyond flaps 10 degrees. We elected to go around and requested vectors to run the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) and opted not to accept holding instructions due to the fact that the autopilot would not engage. Ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree and continued to be vectored southwest of the field until ready for approach on the long Runway (XX). Captain elected to [request priority handling] and I agreed. Insufficient time to notify Dispatch.  very busy right seat due to no autopilot. Captain flew the aircraft and got the radios. Non-normal performance data was loaded and we continued the approach following QRH guidelines. There was some discussion about the speeds; but in the end it was agreed that the speeds were correct. Flaps were extended to 15 using alternate flap extension procedure. QRH finished to completion prior to landing. I notified Flight Attendants of the malfunction and Passengers subsequently as well during the vectoring. Flight Attendants were very professional and informative. Asked Tower to roll the trucks just in case. Landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway and had trucks conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. After that; and brake cooling calculation; we decided it was safe to taxi to the gate. Passengers and In-flight Crew were very positive after opening the cockpit door. I think I heard applause from the back during landing roll-out.After speaking with the Captain one day after this event; he said he had called the Company to discuss further in depth regarding the failure.  At the time of the event it was impossible to ascertain what caused the flaps to cease normal operation.  Captain subsequently described his conversation with Maintenance and explained that they stated two of the flap transmissions had seized. This in turn prevented autopilot engagement.  Perhaps that is why we always hand fly no flap or reduced flap approaches during training?  I am not sure how we could have prevented the flaps from seizing. It's becoming clear to me that the fleet is aging as more and more mechanical issues crop up.",,"On approach; flaps would not extend past 10 degrees.

In the carry forward items section of the release there was a long time fault with the #1 EEC. Then in the log history on Day 0 the aircraft had a leading edge flaps transit light stays on write up. There were a series of write ups with the flaps in the history saying #2 transit light on. The first one starting on Day 0; then Day 1 was the second occurrence; then Day 2; then on our flight on Day 3. All of these write ups had the leading edge flaps transit light on. We did discuss this history together before the flight.Normal flight up until top of descent point. Thunderstorms were starting to pop up into central [state] and there was holding into one of the airports; we think it was ZZZ1. Frequency was very saturated and difficult to get any word with ZZZ2 center or Center. We asked for lower 4 times on frequency before given our first descent and that this point we were 5000+ feet high on the arrival. When finally given descent via ZZZZZ1 landing east we told ATC we would be do are best but were already very high. Speeds on the arrival were complied with and full speed brakes were used from the TOD which was my best guess FL350 down to a cleared to bottom of 6;000 feet. When we switched to approach we were vectored off the arrival for traffic and told to maintain 6;000 feet. Approach gave us a vector off the arrival and then vectored us on ILS approach course. Thunder storms were building all around ZZZ and there were some buildups and rain that we went through when being vectored and re-vectored onto the arrival. At some point during these vectors back onto the ILS Runway XXL approach course we were given a speed reduction to 210 knots. This occurred somewhere on the base leg to final. At that time the Captain called for flaps 1. All indications with the Flap position indicator showed flaps 1; the handle was at flaps 1; but the LE Flaps transit light was still illuminated. A quick glance up at the Leading Edge Devices annunciator panel showed 1 amber light; the rest were green. The amber light was located on the left hand side underneath the flaps 1 number at the top of the annunciator. We were concerned with the approaching thunderstorms to the ZZZ airport so I pulled out the paper Quick Reference Handbook and we began running through the procedure while continuing on the approach. Went to the flight controls tab; then the leading edge flaps transit light page read the notes out loud quickly and then read through point 1 where it gives you the option to choose 1. We read through the first one and ruled it out and had a quick discussion that were was no roll or any indication of any asymmetry. Read the second one and again after some quick discussion agreed it was our problem. Went to step 7 and started to plan for a flaps 15 landing. We set Vref 15 +15 knots. This is where I made an initial error. I selected flaps 15 Vref speed and then put +15 in the wind additive so I think the flaps 15 speed was 160 and I put the plus 15 in the wind additive for a speed of 165 knots initially. Then step 9 is use normal wind additive winds were like 150@9 at the time so would of been + 5 but I did not change anything at this point. Step 10 is to put the ground proximity flap inhibit switch to inhibit so I confirmed that with the Captain and did that. Somewhere right in here we got are last turn on to the approach course and were cleared for the approach. The next step was to calculate landing distance so I had to go to my IPAD this the tables are removed in the Quick Reference Handbook for that. Hit they hyperlinks for the 900ER and found the table and read out the landing distance first for the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry Flap lever 15 and then I realized this was not the right table and found the Leading edge flaps transit flaps 15 aircraft condition. We were approximately 145;000 pounds so I read out 5;000 feet needed for good braking and 7;000 for medium. I then looked at the adjustments to landing distance and the only one that applied was the add per C above ISA and it was minimal. Then went to step 3 for the 15% safety margin and if it went down to medium braking we needing about 8;200 feet of runway and less than 6;000 feet for good. The rain was not hitting the airport currently so we expected to have 600 braking. The runway is listed as 9;000 feet long on the 10-9 and 8;400 ft. available beyond the threshold. I did all this as fast as I could and while we were intercepting the glide slope and starting down on the approach. All through this the center and approach frequencies were completely saturated with constant communication from ATC to other aircraft and us with no real significant breaks between radio transmissions. I read aloud steps 13 and 14 and then went right into the deferred items because we were at that point already. Captain called for gear and flaps 15 somewhere in the middle of the deferred items checklist we finished the checklist somewhere between 1;500 feet and 1;000 feet. Captain asked if we were good and we both agreed we were to continue the approach. I double checked the whole procedure reading it quickly through again and realized I set the flaps 15 speed wrong so by the I think Vref 15 was 149 I added the 15 knots to 164 and put that in on the speed line and then changed the wind additive to +5 so we had an approach speed of 169. I did this right before we were at 1;000 feet. At some point during all of that we were switched over to Tower and cleared to land. There was a corporate jet on the runway and he was being told told we were fast approaching and to vacate the runway. Then given expedite instructions and then a little above 500 feet. tower issued go around instructions to us.We were given a heading slightly off from runway heading an initial climb to 2;000 feet Captain gave all the correct go around commands we went to heading select and flew the Tower assigned heading; we had a discussion of the missed approach instructions because Captain wanted to make sure he heard them correctly and also a discussion about going all the way to clean maneuvering speed or leaving flaps down. Captain wanted to try and recycle the flaps to see if we got the light again. So we did go all the way to flaps up and after takeoff. Eventually Tower gave us a turn to the downwind and a climb to 4;000 feet and switched us back over to approach. Approach re-vectored us on to the course for another ILS XXL approach. Captain redid an abbreviated approach brief and then we selected flaps 1 again and go the LE Flaps transit light. We went through the Quick Reference Handbook again and completed all the steps to the deferred item landing checklist. We completed the deferred item checklist after the gear was selected down and that finished the procedure. While being vectored I did let approach know that we were going to have a final approach speed of 170 knots we never [requested priority handling] or let any outside source know of the flap system malfunction. Our main concern was getting into the field before the thunderstorms passed over it. Captain made an uneventful flaps 15 landing. We exited at [taxiway] 1 and were told to go straight to ramp and ramp told us to go into [the gate]. We complied with instructions and safely parked. Completed the parking checklist and then called ops to let them know of the maintenance problem and Captain put the write up into the ELB.",,,,"B737 First Officer reported operating an aircraft with a long history of leading edge flap asymmetry discrepancies.

At around 35;000 ft on climb out; and prior to cruise; the FO (First Officer) asked if he could go back to the lavatory. I called back to the a FA and got his restroom break set up. While waiting for the 'ok to come out' callback from the a FA; the FO vomited all over the center control pedestal and my right side. After a few seconds to realize what had just happened; I made sure the aircraft was still operating normally (Autopilot B and a VNAV level off to cruise at 37;000 ft). The FO was obviously terribly embarrassed; but he was able to act as my Pilot Monitoring for the rest of the flight. He was not incapacitated; but I instructed him that I would take over as Pilot Flying. I wanted him to just be a very thorough PM (pilot monitoring) for the rest of the flight to back me up with my additional tasks.I then called the A FA again to let them know what had happened; and that we would need some additional galley supplies for an attempted clean up. While attempting to use the intercom; we realized that the entire communications system (VHF 1; VHF 2; intercom; both CA (Captain) and FOs Audio Control panels; headsets; and hand mics) was either failed or working incorrectly. One of the radio transmitters developed an intermittent stuck mike; yet none of the microphone transmit keys anywhere in the cockpit were being pressed. We were unable to transmit on either VHF 1 or 2; but could intermittently receive and transmit on ATIS on VHF 2. We attempted every possible transmitter/receiver combination we could think of; calls in the blind; etc. While I was doing that; the FO was in the Quick Reference Handbook reviewing to see if anything was directly applicable in the Communications or General sections. Since this was not working; I decided to use my authority to ensure a safe outcome. I set the transponder; and sent Dispatch an ACARS briefly explaining what was going on. I asked them for priority on our behalf; and advised we would continue to ZZZ via the filed route and fly the RNAV RNP M with our ETA. Amidst all this going on; the FO mentioned trying to put the Audio Control Panel into Alternate Mode (which forces VHF 1 to the CA side only; disables interphone; etc). When I put the CAs ACP (Audio Control Panel) into Alternate Mode; I was able to regain intermittent transmit ability on VHF 1. We then contacted Center; explained what was going on; and advised them of our plan in the event we lost communications further along in the flight. I then called the flight attendants; explained what was going on; and did a test briefing at the end to make sure we were all on the same page. I then made 2 PAs to the cabin. The first was the standard 'prior to descent/goodbye PA'; the second a few minutes later was an explanation that they could possibly see some priority vehicles near the aircraft on arrival. I simply explained that we had a radio malfunction; but the aircraft was safe and that we would be landing shortly. The FO and I then completed all the normal approach checklists and procedures. The descent; approach; and landing were routine and safe. Since VHF 1 was working intermittently; I was able to get a handoff from Center to ZZZ Tower. I told Tower we would be unable to make any of the ZZZ Channel Traffic calls; so he asked another plane to do it for us and kept the GA traffic off the final approach course for Runway 8. We arrived at the gate; and the FO was met by ZZZ paramedics for evaluation. I spoke with the ZZZ gate agents; and then wrote up the inoperative equipment in the logbook for ZZZ maintenance. I then called Dispatch; the FODO (Flight Operations Duty Officer); and completed this required report.",,,,"B737-700 flight crew reported communication equipment problems following pilot illness incident.",

The vibration continued and at about 8;000 feet; I mentioned it to the FO (First Officer). Both of us have less than 400 hours in the Airbus fleet; and at that point; I was thinking it might still be something normal for an A319; though it was clear by then it wasn't turbulence-driven. We accelerated after 10;000 feet to 320 knots and the vibrations got slightly more noticeable. The FO pulled out his QRH and showed me the checklist for unusual vibrations. I slowed the aircraft to about 305 knots and elected to transfer aircraft control to the FO so that I could run the checklist. Upon attempting to diagnose the problem; it seemed that the vibrations were intermittent and not fully dependent on airspeed. The number 1 engine N1 vibration on first look was .9; which I felt was a bit high; but vibrations continued later with vibration indications all below .5; and the vibrations did not vary with thrust. The airframe vibration checklist is not a true checklist but appears to be a bunch of bullets for crew awareness. It explicitly states that aircraft vibrations due to flight controls 'do not represent handling or performance concerns.' The vibrations initially resembled the symptoms listed in the QRH as flight control vibrations; so we continued our climb. At 14;000 feet the Number 2 Flight Attendant called from the aft galley; to notify me of significant aircraft vibrations; unlike anything she had ever felt. I told her that the vibrations were a known problem in the Airbus fleet. I viewed her report as confirming the verbiage in the QRH; so we continued. But she also indicated that she only flew Airbus trips and her seniority number indicated over XX years as a Flight Attendant (FA); and she was insistent that she had never experienced these vibrations before. So at the least; that information suggested an atypical problem. I called the Number 1 FA to ask what she was experiencing. She said that she felt some minor vibrations but nothing that concerned her. She also suggested the Number 2 FA had a flair for drama; in so many words. We continued the climb; but I asked the FO to slow us a little more to 290; while we considered the QRH guidance. The way the QRH is written; it suggests troubleshooting the problem; which seems to conflict with the FOM section concerning troubleshooting. Upon discussion; we elected to put in 1.5 units of rudder trim for a short while to try to alleviate the vibrations; which appeared effective.Throughout the climb; the vibrations continued intermittently with varying intensity. At about 30;000 feet; the FO and I decided that the vibrations were not fitting any one specific problem listed in the QRH. I still didn't have enough information to decide upon whether to continue the flight; but I reasoned that the lower dynamic pressure at a higher altitude would be as safe or safer; while we continued to try to diagnose the problem. I had the FO slow to 260 KIAS while I prepared to call Dispatch to see if I could reach an Airbus specialist. I was interrupted by the Number 2 who called to repeat her concerns to me; before I could complete the call. I explained to her again that what she was experiencing was described in our checklist and that I could only go by the checklist. At this point; though; I still wasn't sure which specific problem we had. We were experiencing 'characteristics' that were listed under both elevator and rudder vibrations. On crew-phone; the Dispatcher was able to connect me to an Airbus maintenance specialist. By now; we had leveled off at a cruise altitude of 34;000 feet. I described the symptoms to him; and he didn't seem to understand any better than us what we were experiencing. I mentioned that the elevator vibe was supposed to appear above 280 knots; the rudder vibe was supposed to appear above 260 knots; and by this point; we were .77 Mach and 255knots and still experiencing the vibrations intermittently. The maintenance technician had no explanation and as ZZZ1 was 45 miles off the nose; I told the maintenance tech and the Dispatcher that we were diverting to ZZZ1. They both concurred; and I broke down the phone patch.The FO had heard me when I said we were diverting and concurred. I asked him to get a clearance to divert to ZZZ1 and to set the cockpit up for our arrival. We decided to keep the speed back at 250 KIAS for the descent; and I instructed the FO to not use speed brakes as a precaution; as we had decided we had a malfunction of unknown origin. The FO mentioned that we would be overweight by a few thousand pounds so I told him to [receive priority] and request ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) meet us after landing. ATC vectored us to manage our altitude loss. I discontinued the Airframe Vibration analysis and ran the Non-Routine Landing Considerations OD checklist as a Precautionary landing. After talking to the flight attendants and the passengers; I briefed the arrival and approach to the FO. Then I assumed pilot flying duties while the FO completed normal procedures checklists. ATC had offered an RNAV to [Runway] XXC; but I requested an ILS to XXR as I wanted to have the best possible indication of any pitch variations. I configured the aircraft and slowed early so we would have some altitude in case any controllability issues occurred in the landing configuration. I elected to land flaps full if things were normal up to CONF 3 as we were only a few thousand pounds above max landing weight; and we had plenty of go-around thrust. The aircraft handled fine; so we dropped flaps to full; though the FO and I agreed that there seemed to be slightly abnormal vibrations all the way to landing.Touchdown and landing rollout were normal. We asked the tower and fire chief if they saw anything unusual as we were ending the rollout. They said no; so I elected to taxi clear. I made a PA to the passengers reminding them that the emergency vehicles that we were expecting would be visible and that they would follow us as we taxied to the gate. I realize now in writing this account that I forgot to put the overweight landing in the logbook. I was also reminded by another pilot that the Airbus has an overweight landing checklist that we forgot to run; although the FO and I accomplished everything on the checklist in considering the overweight landing.That would depend upon what Maintenance discovers about this problem.There is some confusion in the way the relevant section in the QRH is written; and the direction in the QRH to troubleshoot the problem; which appears in various malfunctions; should be reconciled with FOM section which directs not to troubleshoot. Also; the Airframe Vibration checklist has zero guidance; if air frame vibrations don't fall into any of the listed categories. Obviously; there are too many possible causes of unusual vibrations to list them all; but some direction as to if/when to land based upon some generic criteria like vibe intensity; etc.; would have been nice. Additionally; we are trained in the school; over and over again to run V1 cuts; and we never or rarely run an overweight landing checklist. A simple bullet in the Non-Routine Landing Checklist suggesting to run the overweight landing checklist; time/conditions permitting; would have been helpful to us.",,,,"Pilot reported aircraft making unusual vibrations which led to a diversion to another airport.",

We were flying a 737-700; which has a flaps 30 speed of 165 kts. We were told to maintain 180 kts. to FAF; which occurred at about 1;500 ft. AGL. We therefore had approximately 500 ft. to slow the aircraft and select flaps 30 to meet stabilized approach criteria.The Pilot Flying (PF) requested gear down and flaps 15 approaching glide slope intercept. As I was doing OE; my focus was on watching the FO slow down to 165 kts. so we could select flap 30. I did not notice that when selected to 15; the flaps had stopped at about 8 degrees. When the FO requested flaps 30 and landing check; I ran the checklist and saw that the flaps were not at 30. By this time we were at 1;100 ft. AGL. I instructed the FO to initiate a missed approach and informed Tower that we were going around due to a system malfunction. The missed approach was well flown by the FO; and I felt comfortable having him continue to fly while I worked the problem; and I set the speed at 200 kts.; so not to over speed or stress the flaps. I called back and told the Flight Attendants that we had a malfunction and would need a few minutes before returning to land and that I would call back when I had time and brief them more comprehensively. I made a PA to the passengers that we had an abnormal indication and we would return to land as soon as we had finished our checklists; and that there was no reason to be concerned. I then sent an ACARS message to dispatch alerting them that were would request priority handling due to a flap issue.We completed the QRH procedures; then requested priority handling with ATC; as we would be landing in a non-normal configuration. I called back to the Flight Attendants and briefed them using the TEST method and informed them that we would land normally and that they could expect a normal taxi to the gate. We followed the QRH and selected flaps 15 using the ALTN system; and landed normally. We informed ATC on the ground that we did not require further assistance; but a truck followed us to the gate per their protocol.At the gate we met with maintenance personnel and spoke with the Chief Pilot.We both felt comfortable and able to continue with our scheduled flying; so we did.",,,,"737-700 Captain reported a trailing edge flap problem resulted in a go around to perform the QRH procedures.

The plane came in the night before; and this write up was cleared. It was the first flight of the day for this airplane. On taxi out; all systems operated normally. We had a delay on the ground for flow into ZZZ. So we had about a 25 minute taxi. Everything was operating normally until we leveled off at FL360; about 30 minutes after takeoff. Shortly after that; we got a ding. Looked over and saw Hydraulic: G RSVR OVHT ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). Captain divided task by having me fly and do the radios; and he will deal with the ECAM. The ECAM directed us to turn off the PTU (Power Transfer Unit) and Green Hydraulic Pump. We verified each switch before selecting it off. We went over they system pages; and talked about what systems were lost. The CA then went into the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). The QRH had a statement to restore the lost system once it was no longer overheated. Also the QRH noted that we could have a 10% higher burn due to spoiler float. We took the burn to destination then added 10% subtracted that from our FOB. We felt we would still land in ZZZ with plenty of gas. Then the CA notified dispatch; and got a frequency to talk to Maintenance Control. We all agreed that continuing to ZZZ was the best course of action. After about 6 minutes; I noticed the fault had cleared. Since the Green system has landing great extension; nose wheel steering; normal breaking; thrust reverser 1; and 2 spoilers on it; we felt trying to restore the system closer to the airport was the safest option. We were concerned if we restored the system too early; it would overheat again on approach. We advised center of our situation; and requested priority handling.With a little less than an hour left; we started briefing. We started talking about all the threats we would have if the system was not restored. We talked about gravity extension; longer landing distance; not being able to steer off the runway. We talked about if we had to go around; we would not be able to retract our gear. That meant higher fuel burn coming back to land. We decided on downwind trying to restore the green system would be the best place; because if it did not restore we would have plenty of time to notify ATC we will be needing a tug and perform the gravity gear extension procedure. We decided to Configure early if the system restored In case it would over heat again. Talked about if the system over headed again on final approach after configuring; what we would do. We had two jump seaters; and we asked them if they had any other suggestions or they agreed with our plan of action. They agreed with our plan; and provided some concerns to keep in mind. We told ATC we will need XXL for landing; because it was the longest runway. Told ATC we will need ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) standing by; and notified them of potentially needing to be towed off the runway. After we were done briefing; the CA took over flying the airplane. When abeam the field; we were able to restore the Green system. Made a normal approach and landing. We are able to taxi off the runway and to the gate on our own power. Maintenance met us at the gate; and we told them of the issues. They informed us that this has been a reoccurring issue over the past several days. Great teamwork; workload management; and communication lead this event to be a successful outcome.",,"Shortly after reaching cruise altitude; we received an ECAM for a Green Hydraulic System Reservoir Overheat. We referenced the overhead panel and confirmed the associated fault light illuminated. After passing Flying Pilot duties to the first officer; I initiated the steps associated ECAM. Simply stated; the Green Hydraulic System was isolated (PTU Off) and secured (Engine Pump Off). The Fault light remained illuminated; and the Overheat Indication was noted. The two remaining hydraulic systems (Blue and Yellow) sustained all hydraulic needs at cruise flight. Our next step was to complete the QRH and calculate the associated Non-Normal Performance Landing Distance. Both tasks were accomplished. The First Officer and I had a quick discussion regarding our options on this short flight. After building a game plan; I queried Dispatch to Call Me and asked them to bring Maintenance Control on the line. We discussed the Hydraulic non normal and the associated re-occurring maintenance history that had been reviewed with the Flight Plan and Maintenance Release in ZZZ1. We advised that the Fault light had extinguished (approximately 6 minutes) and the hydraulic reservoir temperature had cooled to the point the system was no longer exceeding temperature limits. Noting this condition; the First Officer; Maintenance Control and I all agreed that the QRH procedure for attempting to restore Green Hydraulic power prior to arrival would be an option. Dispatch was then engaged regarding our flight and continuing to ZZZ. While this was my preference; I included the dispatcher in the conversation and confirmed they had no objection to this course of action. At this point the call concluded and we agree to stay in communication via ACARS.An ELB entry was made to document the non-normal and support Maintenance Control's phone call to ZZZ Maintenance advising them of our inbound aircraft and situation. At this point the approach briefing was conducted. The briefing outlined our plan to attempt green system restoration in the terminal area and continue with green system pressure for a normal landing. Alternatively; we brief that if the system could not be restored; we would proceed with a manual gear extension; loss of spoilers 1/5 on landing; loss of normal breaking; nose wheel steering; #1 Thrust Reverser (etc...). The approach briefing was conducted; and we engaged our two jump seating Company pilots who were in the flight deck commuting home to ZZZ. Both offered their thoughts and suggestions to enhance our game plan. Additionally; the jump seating pilots switched seats to allow the jump seating pilot with previous Airbus experience to occupy the primary (center) jump seat. I handed the jump seater my QRH to back up the First Officer in the event additional checklists were required in the terminal area (I.E.: Manual Gear Extension). Lastly; we as a crew did a preliminary review of the manual gear extension procedure should hydraulic system restoration be unsuccessful.Our flight requested priority handling with ZZZ Center and advised them of our Hydraulic System condition; our desire to attempt restoration prior to landing; Fuel; SOB and Dangerous Goods. Additionally; we informed them we required Runway XXL for arrival and that we may or may not have nose wheel steering on arrival depending on the outcome of our system restoration attempt. An ACARS was sent to Dispatch advising of our request for priority handling. The Flight Attendants were apprised next with a test Briefing and advised of the situation and game plan. Lastly; I made an announcement to the passengers advising them of the situation and thanked them for flying with us. At this point I assumed the flying pilot duties again and the First Officer resumed pilot monitoring duties. ATC shortened our routing; removed all airspeed constraints and we initiated our descent for the ZZZ Airport. While on the downwind course at approximately 8;000 feet; we executed the QRH procedure to restore the Green System as the overheat condition was no longer present. Fortunately; the system restoration was successful and the green system was restored to 3;000 psi. The aircraft was configured normally and continued a normal landing without further hydraulic issues or overheat indications. The aircraft was met by ARFF on arrival and they proceeded to followed our aircraft to the gate. The aircraft taxied to the gate under it's own steering and power. After block in; the flight was debriefed with the First Officer and Jump seaters. After deplaning; I had a debrief conversation with our purser and thanked them for their assistance. Lastly; Company maintenance boarded the aircraft for a debrief of the hydraulic reservoir overheat and system restoration.",,"A320 flight crew reported a Green Hydraulic System Reservoir Overheat light illuminated in flight.

Approximately 15 seconds later while climbing through FL 220; #1 Engine had substantial loss of thrust with loud noise and vibration. Aircraft yawed sharply left. FO was still hand flying at this point. He immediately announced 'My Aircraft'; applied right rudder & aileron while reducing aircraft pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. I instructed him to level off and regain control of aircraft. Notified ATC that we wanted to stop the climb and descend back to FL 210. Then turned attention back to #1 Engine. Was producing about 35-40% N1 while still making noise and vibrating. FO disconnected Auto throttles and retarded #1 thrust lever to idle. Noise and vibration stopped with engine still running at flight idle. #1 FA called to ask if we had heard the noise.

I [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors back to ZZZ. ATC began vectors with an initial right hand turn to the southwest; followed by a turn to the west. I told controller we would need a decent sized box pattern back to ZZZ to accomplish checklists. Received ATC clearance back to ZZZ via radar vectors. FO suggested descent to exit icing conditions. I made the request with ATC and we descended back into clear air at 17;000 feet; where FO trimmed the aircraft for single-engine cruise. I suggested an attempt to see if the engine would now produce any more power. As the FO began to advance the #1 thrust lever; the noise and vibration returned without any increase in thrust. After discussing the situation with the FO; I made the decision to secure the engine. I used the QRH to accomplish engine severe damage or separation; one engine inoperative landing; and non-routine landing Checklists. This included briefing the flight attendants for a precautionary landing; making 2 PAs to the passengers; and notifying Dispatch via the Crew Phone. Received radar vectors for ILS to Runway XX in VMC. Confirmed with ATC that ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) would be standing by.FO was still PF while I also made all necessary modifications to the FMC; including route change and setting up for the approach. Completed normal Descent checklist and Before Landing checklist to the line. Once established on final approach; I assumed control of the aircraft and became the PF to accomplish the landing. I made this decision because I had much more experience in the 737 (new CA with just 130 hours but flew it for 2 years an FO with about 1400 hours). The new hire FO had just recently completed his OE and had just over 40 hours in the 737. We had identified the low-time status for each of us as a threat in our earlier briefing at the gate. Configured for single-engine landing and completed Before Landing checklist. Performed single-engine landing on Runway XX at ZZZ. Stopped aircraft on the runway at approximately the mid-field position (near taxiway F). Made a quick PA instructing passengers to remain seated as Safety vehicles completed an inspection. ATC assigned discreet frequency for us to communicate with ARFF Commander. Had ARFF conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. Received the 'all clear' and then taxied to gate with ARFF following us. Upon arriving at gate; made a final PA to passengers advising them that the aircraft would be going out of service and to take all belongings as they exited; and that a gate agent would have more information concerning the flight as a new plan was put together. Gate agent came on board and informed me thatthey had a new aircraft and gate. I informed passengers of the new gate with a final PA. Made an AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) entry for the engine failure and discussed with Maintenance Supervisor; who had also come on board. I want to commend the performance of the New Hire FO. He did an outstanding job of maintaining aircraft control and communicating with ATC when I was otherwise busy talking to other involved parties. While new to airline with just over 40 hours in the 737; his previous experience as a different make/model pilot proved invaluable. I think we worked together very well by implementing the company strategy and communicating effectively. It proves that 2 pilots who were flying just our 2nd leg together can 'gel' and successfully work through a serious situation.",,,,"B737 Captain reported loss of thrust and engine vibration after selecting Engine Anti Ice to on.

I started the initial descent from 38;000 feet; shortly after starting the descent the Master Caution Light illuminated with the corresponding 'Auto Fail' Light illuminating on the pressurization panel. At that time I also noticed that the Cruise Altitude and Landing Altitude displays were blanked. I called out the abnormality and the Captain stated that it was 'Your Aircraft'. At that time I verified that I was in control of the aircraft 'My Aircraft' and continued the descent. Continuing the descent I also worked the radios while the captain proceeded to run the 'Auto Fail' light checklist in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). Initially it looked as though the captain was able to control the pressurization but around 22 thousand feet the captain directed me to put on my O2 mask. After donning the O2 masks and establishing crew communications the Captain told me to request priority handling and he then manually deployed the Passengers O2 masks. Once we were below 10;000 feet the Captain directed me to remove my O2 mask at that time we completed all normal checklists and landed safely.During the Auto Fail light checklist I noticed that the 'Auto Fail' light stayed illuminated and the 'ALT' and 'MAN' light never illuminated during the checklist. During the descent a slower rate of descent may have helped with controlling the pressurization of the Aircraft. After Landing maintenance informed us that the aircraft had previous pressurization issues with this aircraft. (9 write ups on Pressurization Problems was mentioned). I believe a slower rate of descent and smaller thrust reductions may have helped with manually controlling the pressurization after the initial pressurization failure. I also believe with multiple write ups on the pressurization system their may have been an issue that maintenance might not have caught.",,"Just after starting our descent into ZZZ from FL380; we got a Master Caution Light and 'AUTO FAIL' light on pressurization panel. No other lights on. Both cruise altitude window and landing altitude window had dashes '- - - -'.  Checked cabin altitude and deferential pressure; both ok at this time. Cabin vertical speed indicator began moving between 330 FPM down to near 1;000 FPM down.  Initiated 'Auto Fail' checklist on iPad QRH. When directed to go to manual control; manual light did not come on.  Was able to control cabin vertical speed between 300 FPM to 800 FPM with momentary switch movements open/close. FO was pilot flying so I gave him aircraft and radios while I worked the manual valve. Descending thru approximately FL220 cabin started to climb and cabin deferential started going down at steady but rapid rate. Looked like we were loosing control of the cabin. Directed FO to put on O2 masks and request priority handling.  I elected to manually deploy the cabin O2 before the cabin went above 10;000 feet. Initiated loss of cabin pressure checklist. Made a PA instructing the passengers to put on mask and follow crew member instructions. Called the Flight Attendants to let the know where we were at and notified the company thru ACARS. Did not complete emergency descent checklist as we were approaching 10;000 feet. Below 10;000 feet I made a PA. We were at a safe altitude and everyone could remove the O2 masks. Looking at the cabin altitude indicator showed basically our current altitude with differential pressure gauge at the upper limits. We could feel the pressure changes in our ears. At that point I check with the flight attendants to see if any was going to need medical assistance on the ground. They told my everyone was fine. Gave them my game plan for a normal landing and taxi to the gate. Let ATC know we were not going to need assistance on the ground and would land and taxi to the gate. After arriving at the gate and had deplaned; two passengers were complaining of ear pain and customer service people had called paramedics to have the checked out. 9 prior write-ups referencing pressurization problems. 2. Possible option- While in the descent ATC gave us the next crossing restriction. Thinking now the FO may have reduced the power more and the change in engine power may have cause the cabin to climb. With all the other erratic indications I didn't recognize this and called for the O2 masks. Recommend adding a caution note just after step 4 or 5 in the 'Auto Fail' checklist recommending manual throttles and small coordinated movements of the throttles while doing manual pressurization and to coordinate with ATC for an easy descent if able.",,"B737 flight crew reported loss of cabin pressure control during descent and the need for oxygen masks.

During startup we had an ELAC 1 fault which was cleared with ECAM. I was PF (Pilot Flying) and after takeoff; the aircraft had a heavy vibration and roll action. We continued the climb and cleaned up the aircraft. We had a FA (Flight Attendant) visually confirm that the left spoilers were deployed with the spoiler handle in the down and disarmed position. We continued to climb and the vibration mostly dissipated but was still evident. After confirmation with Maintenance Control and Dispatch on the Crew Phone; we elected to divert and land in ZZZ instead of continuing to destination ZZZ1. We burned down as much fuel as we could and set up for an approach. When we configured to flaps 2 the serious vibrations started again. We preformed a controllability check at pattern altitude and determined that the vibration was too great at flaps full so we used flaps 3 for landing. As we got closer to the Runway; the vibrations dissipated a bit and we made a normal landing overweight by 10;000 pounds into ZZZ. We had ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire) inspect the aircraft for damage; which there was none apparent and taxied to a gate and gave the aircraft to maintenance.  Our inspection of the aircraft at the gate found the right ground spoiler still extended. We are unsure if that was left over from the flight or just the landing roll. The only indications we received during the flight were the green spoiler arrows on ECAM. No other warnings or messages came up. We were and still are perplexed at how any spoilers could have been extended with the handle stowed. There could have been a secondary malfunction with the SEC 3 issue. It caught us totally by surprise. We followed the placard requirements of the SEC which were very basic.

The CA called for autopilot engagement. Immediately upon autopilot engagement the aircraft started tracking right of course. The Captain disengaged the autopilot and auto thrust so as to maintain directional control and airspeed as the aircraft seemed to be having difficulty with direction and speed. Tower handed us off to Departure and upon checking in with departure the vibration had dramatically worsened into what I would call more of a severe shake than a vibration so we [advised ATC] and requested a return to the field on the initial check in. Departure gave us vectors for a right hand pattern back to Runway XX. We were assigned an altitude of 5;000 ft. We made it to 5;000 ft. but we had difficulty maintaining altitude. The Captain kept control of the aircraft and had me cycle though the doors; wheels; and flight control pages to try and identify the problem. We found that the flight control page showed the left 3 outboard spoilers were deployed. The FA (Flight Attendant) called twice; first to tell us about the vibration in the back and the second time to tell us that 2 rows of O2 masks had dropped. The Captain made the decision to land flaps 3. We landed on Runway XX and the vibration continued until touchdown. Upon arrival at the gate we found that spoilers on the left had closed however there was a spoiler deployed on the right wing. There was an apparent issue with SEC 3 and it's control of the spoilers as SEC 3 was on an MEL due to the same issue on a previous flight. If there is an issue with a flight control maybe the aircraft should be out of service until the repair is made instead of the MEL.",,"High terrain environment. During the takeoff roll; the aircraft felt difficult (heavy) to rotate. I did not rotate forcefully. I picked the nose up and let the airplane fly off the ground. Vibration started with gear retraction and grew worse. Like nose wheel shimmy multiplied. Excessive and severe vibration was apparent and increasing in intensity. I called for the autopilot to limit distraction. The autopilot instantly rolled right. Autothrust was accelerating beyond SID speeds and the trend vector beyond 250 kts. I switched the autopilot off then switched autothrust off. I had the FO (First Officer) turn flight directors off and engage Track/FPA to help hold attitude. At this point we had been switched to Departure frequency and we checked on [advising ATC] and requesting return to the field. ATC provided vectors. Severe vibration was felt throughout the aircraft. FA's (Flight Attendants) called me shortly after takeoff about the vibration (we informed them we were aware) and then they called again on the downwind to tell me O2 masks had fallen in 2 rows (we informed them we returning for landing and would deal with that later). It was difficult to hold altitude and airspeed. Any turn resulted in a descent requiring power to recover. Any distraction pulling me away from the PFD caused a change in heading and altitude. VLS and V alpha prot were very high. I had the FO cycle through the Doors; Wheels; and F/CTL ECAM pages to find out what was causing the vibration. The F/CTL page indicated the left outboard 3 spoilers were deployed (un-commanded). The high VLS and V alpha prot plus the handling characteristics were consistent with having spoilers extended. (I checked the position of the spoiler handle - it was in the retracted position).We circled back to land on Runway XX. I stated to the FO that we would have to land flaps 3 due to the spoilers being extended and had the FO look for an airframe vibration QRH checklist. (After action review indicated that this checklist would not have helped.) The approach was difficult due to the high V alpha prot. I had to choose between slowing down or maintaining the descent profile to get flaps out. I had very little margin between Flap extension speed and VLS; and coincidentally VLS was maybe 2 kts. above V alpha prot. I considered overspeeding the flaps if necessary to slow down. It wasn't necessary; but just barely. We landed Flaps 3 intentionally; however; we did not select flaps 3. Time issue. The FO was task saturated. I used selected speed and manual thrust to landing.I made no PA's until after landing. I had my hands full and the FO was too new on the aircraft to turn over control. The FO did a good job and I was issuing very fast commands. He handled it well. SEC 3 was deferred per an MEL. We were unable to see the position of the number 1 and 2 spoilers on both wings. I read and complied with the 'O' procedures of the MEL. When we arrived at the gate after returning to the field we found the Right #1 spoiler full extended. I have been told that a passenger saw the spoiler extended prior to takeoff (this is here say and I have no proof if it's true or false). When and how that spoiler was extended is unknown to me. The deferral results in amber X's being displayed in that spoiler position on the ECAM page. In addition to that; we had 3 outboard spoilers deployed (un-commanded) on the left wing. This was the second event involving vibration and poor handling characteristics including the autopilot roll that I know of-- the first was clearly not as severe. Obviously; this was a serious problem with the spoilers and the aircraft should not have been in service. Aircraft should be removed from service if there is sufficient vibration to result in a loss of control. This aircraft had diverted once already because of this. We did not have enough information available to know what to expect. If we had been aware of what had occurred before; I would most likely have refused the airplane.",,"Air Carrier Captain and First Officer reported that 3 spoilers on the left outer wing deployed during rotation and climb.

I reduced the thrust to about 50% to help reduce the climb rate; once we leveled and applied power we got multiple consecutive compressor stalls from the #1 engine.

We took off during the climb out around 10-11;000 ft.; we noticed a fuel imbalance and the number one main tank was indicating  approximately 1300 lbs. less than the right. The Captain ran the QRH for a fuel leak- it didn't appear that we had an imbalance after running some numbers and not being able to account for a huge drop in fuel. Thinking about the jet fuel smell based back on the ground in ZZZ was the question - that did we have a fuel leak - so [we advised ATC] and we returned to ZZZ. The QRH says to shut down an engine. Given the close proximity to ZZZ; we did not. The rest of the flight was uneventful Fire and rescue didn't notice anything abnormal upon meeting us once we cleared the runway.",,"On a single engine taxi out a strong jet fuel odor was noticed by both myself and the first officer; as this is not an uncommon event; we continued the taxi out but the smell seemed to persist longer than is normal. After starting the number 1 engine; the smell seemed to dissipate; so we decided to continue for takeoff.  After a normal departure climbing out of 10;000 ft. and accelerating we noticed a fuel imbalance; with the number 1 main tank indicating approximately 1200-1300 lbs. less than the right main tank. I checked the fuel burned numbers to see if this could just be an imbalance because of a lower pressure center tank pump causing us to burn fuel out of the main tank; and found that we could not account for 900 lbs. of fuel. We ran the QRH for a fuel leak; which confirmed a potential fuel leak. The QRH for a fuel leak states 'A change in fuel imbalance of 500 lbs. within 30 minutes or less'. We were less than 15 minutes into the flight; and had a fuel imbalance of 1200 lbs. and could not account for where 900 lbs. of the fuel had gone by checking the fuel used and comparing it to the fuel we left with. We decided to return to ZZZ and [advised ATC] as a precaution. The QRH then leads you to 'go to step 11' which directs a precautionary engine shut down. I utilized my Captains authority to leave the engine running since we were so close to landing; and fuel starvation was not an imminent threat.  This part of the QRH should be reviewed; as it seems foolish to shut down an engine based on the guidance from the first part of the checklist; as there is more than one thing that could cause you to get to step 11; such as a faulty indication. I mention the fuel smell during taxi out; because it did lead me to believe that we could be facing a greater threat and made me quicker to make the decision to return; vs continuing longer and seeing if I could identify an actual leak; or if it would stabilize. After landing; we had airport fire and rescue inspect the airplane to see if they saw any fuel leaks; which they did not. We taxied to the gate for an uneventful end to the flight.",,"Air Carrier flight crew reported a fuel odor during departure taxi which dissipated and returned during initial climb accompanied with a fuel imbalance indication.

I was flying and primarily watching outside with a short scan inside. I can't remember if I called for flaps 1 or 5 first. Regardless; when I thought I had the flaps at 5; I called for the landing gear down and flaps 15 before arriving at the FAF. I then looked at the flap gauge; because the aircraft didn't feel right (felt nose high but we were bouncing around) and noticed the flaps were indicating between UP and 1. We executed a go-around.  We examined the gauge and saw they were split. This was confirmed by the control inputs I was feeling. Captain ran the checklist and coordinated with Flight Attendants and Passengers. I flew and worked ATC. We completed the checklist and proceeded in to Runway XXR. Landing was uneventful. We cleared and held on Taxiway between 8 and 9 where the fire trucks met us. We coordinated for a discreet frequency to talk with them and and asked they keep an eye on the wheels for smoke/fire/abnormalities and also asked them to get a temp reading.  Fire said the brakes were hot but didn't see any smoke or other indications. We re-examined the brake cooking data that we got while on downwind. We discovered an error of using manual braking and no reverses. That was changed to reflect air bulletin X as directed by the landing data and max reverse. The new brake cooling data gave us a 30 minute cool down and allowed for taxi. We slowly taxied and waited for the remaining time before arriving at the gate.",,"On visual approach to XXL after initial flaps were selected; we had an asymmetrical trailing edge indication as noted on the flap gauge and a very subtle roll. I called for go around and we were boxed back around. We ran the appropriate checklist and brake cooling. I talked to the Flight Attendants and Passengers. We had an uneventful landing. We had Fire and Rescue waiting; we stopped after exiting the runway and let them visually inspect tires and brakes.

Flap indications were normal (indicator aligned) during preflight; and flaps deployed normally for takeoff. After takeoff the flaps retracted normally; and there was no adverse or abnormal trim required for flight. The indicator showed a slight split that we saw during cruise. In anticipation of a potential problem; the FO (First Officer; Pilot Monitoring) and I reviewed the flap scenarios from the QRH enroute 'just in case' the flaps didn't extend and were somewhat prepared for this. The WX was good; and we had extra ferry fuel to play with. When ATC wanted us to slow during the arrival phase we were unable. We [advised ATC] and asked for a vector while we ran a checklist. They vectored us downwind to an area and gave us box vectors over the lake. We initially went with the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry checklist; which took us to the Trailing Edge Flaps Up Landing Checklist due to the Lever being UP to match the closest flaps setting. The leading edge devices deployed correctly using the alternative method IAW the checklist. I briefed the FAs as to the situation and the precautionary landing IAW the non-routine landing considerations and briefed the passengers of the situation and that we would be doing a faster than normal landing and that safety vehicles would be present to inspect the brakes due to the speed. We attempted to contact ZZZ ops to no avail; and I was unsure if crew phone would work at 4K'; so I elected to bypass that part. With checklists complete; and a pause to make sure we were both in the loop and comfortable with the scenario thus far; we advised ATC we were ready for the approach to 28C with flaps up; leading edge devices extended. We had also previously requested response vehicles at the runway out of an abundance of caution and to inspect the brakes due to the speed of the landing. We were below max landing weight. Approach was as normal as you can get for the situation; the landing was smooth; and I applied judicious brakes to go along with the reversers. We taxied clear of the runway with several thousand feet remaining. I reminded the pax to remain seated while we had the brakes inspected; then taxied to the gate normally. After deplaning I held the crew for a quick debrief and to let a couple of them decompress. After landing the flaps indicator aligned back normally; however I made sure the write up indicated the split. Aircraft had previous write up for flaps not deploying; which was signed off by maintenance the day prior. The write up did not indicate an asymmetry; or even if the aircraft had been in flight when it occurred. On another note; the FO (PM) did an outstanding job of pacing; monitoring; and working through the processes. The ZZZ personnel were very supportive and present quickly when we got to the gate. I don't think I could set up a more 'like a simulator' scenario if I tried. We had enough of a break to decompress a bit and were fit to continue the day. Maintenance unable to replicate previous condition as it was written in the logbook. Given that everything worked normally until it didn't; I don't think I have preventive measures for this incident. This is why we get trained and paid.",,,,"B737 Captain reported conducting a no flap landing after the flaps would not deploy and noted the aircraft was signed off by maintenance for the same issue a day prior to the flight.",

Ran the QRH and turned the pump off. Coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance over HF and decide to continue as we had normal pressure and adequate quantity. Just prior to the CP; the reservoir started fluctuating and dropped to 20%. still had 2;950 PSI. over the next 2 hours the quantity fluctuated between 0 and 7%. we discussed the possibility of losing the associated electric pump and the whole A system and looked over the QRH so we were prepared for it on descent into ZZZ1. Both pressures were approximately 2;950 PSI most of the flight. On descent to ZZZ1 we got system B Engine Driven Pump low pressure and ran the QRH again. Turned the pump off and requested priority handling. Requested XXL and notified Dispatch and Flight Attendants. Gear came down slower than normal and flaps as well. We configured normal and landed normal. Brakes worked normal as well as nose wheel steering. System B quantity and pressure seemed to remain normal. Taxied to the gate and Maintenance opened the #1 engine cowl to find hydraulic fluid everywhere. I left before they addressed the #2 engine.",,"The ENG 1 hydraulic low pressure light illuminated in cruise flight. We ran the checklist from the QRH; which only says to turn the pump off. Within approximately 30-60 minutes; the quantity in the A system dropped to 20%. This is commensurate with the level of the standpipe in the A reservoir. It was our thinking that the engine-driven pump in the A system failed and a leak occurred in that pump or associated lines. Over the course of the flight; the quantity in the A system fluctuated between 13-0%; I surmise because of cold-soaking of the remaining fluid. At all times the electric hydraulic pump in the A system remained on with good pressure at 3;000 PSI. We talked on HF radio with Maintenance and Dispatch. They couldn't think of anything else we could do. It was at times difficult to understand them; which is consistent with typical performance of HF. SATCOM would have been a welcome tool.We reviewed checklists for possible scenarios; including loss of A system pressure; and even loss of A and B system pressure; and we discussed possibilities. After evaluating all options; we decided to press on to ZZZ1. The B system was working fine; the A system still had good pressure; and there were no issues with the Standby hydraulic system. We were expecting a normal landing. At worst; we thought we may have to do a manual gear extension if the A system electric pump stopped producing good pressure.At top of descent into ZZZ1; at the exact moment the thrust levers retarded for descent; the ENG 2 hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. We ran the QRH checklist and turned that pump off as well. We were both a bit confused as to why the B system engine-driven pump would fail. It was unexpected. Because we now had two major pump failures in separate systems; we requested priority handling with ATC and requested Runway XXL; the longest runway. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch; and did a briefing with the Purser. I also made a PA to the passengers and said we expected a normal landing; but they may see some emergency equipment standing by. We configured early; and flaps and gear slowly came down. Good pressure and quantity were maintained on the B side with the electric pump throughout the remainder of the flight. A side hydraulic pressure also remained at 3;000 PSI. Last I saw; quantity on the A side was 11% and B side was at 96%. Landing and taxi in were uneventful.On the ground; the Mechanics opened the #1 engine cowling and hydraulic fluid was dripping out. They also seemed confused as to why the B system engine-driven pump would have failed.

One was indicating fully up while the other was beyond that showing that it was even 'more up' than the limit. Upon further discussion we agreed that it was probably an indication issue as it's impossible for the flaps to be split in that manner. We decided to extend the flaps early on descent in case of any issues with deployment. At around 10;000 MSL I called 'flaps 1'. The Captain moved the flap/slat handle to the 1 position. There was no indication of motion of flaps or LED's. I remained the flying Pilot and took over the radios after we requested priority and requested a Runway (XXC) from Regional Approach at ZZZ. The Captain and I had a brief discussion on which checklist to use. We agreed on flap asymmetry since that was what the indicator was depicting. We were able to get the LED's extended fully and land via the trailing edge flaps up checklist. Upon landing we taxied to the gate normally with Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting following. Worth note is that after landing the trailing edge flap indicator reverted back to normal.I'm not sure what caused the trailing edge flaps to not extend.",,,,"B737-800 First Officer reported the trailing edge flap indicator had a split between left and right flap.",

I was the flying pilot and called for the QRC for said message. We ran the (767) ENG OVHT - L checklist as appropriate. Once I retarded the thrust lever as indicated in Step 4; the EICAS message extinguished. We continued through the checklist and maintained a thrust setting that maintained the ENG OVHT message not displayed as required. We were in clear skies and a non icing environment.At Step 9 of the checklist; I handed the controls over to FO (First Officer) in order to contact Dispatch and Maintenance Control. We sent them a brief message with the current failure and asked them to contact us via SELCAL. We called the back and had them wake up Relief Pilot who was on their rest break to come back to the FLT Deck. I also spoke with the Purser and advised them of our current engine overheat situation and that we would keep them appraised of the plan. Once on the line with Dispatch and Maintenance Control we collectively discussed the appropriate course of action. We also had them patch in our Chief Pilot for added consultation. As a crew; and after discussion with Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and our Chief Pilot; we determined that the safest course of action was to return to base and not continue across the Atlantic with a possibility of a more serious situation occurring should we continue.We contacted ATC and advised them of the need to return to ZZZ. We [requested priority handling] and due to the fact that we were going to land at max weight with Flaps 20 with a higher approach speed due to this non normal configuration.I again communicated with the Purser to advise her of our decision to return to ZZZ and an estimate of our time to landing. I made a passenger announcement advising them of our current situation and that in the best interest of safety we would be returning to ZZZ assuring them that we would be landing safely within an hour. As a crew; we made a plan and executed it. We had to dump our center tank fuel which was around 10K pounds to assist us in getting below our max landing weight. ATC authorized our fuel dump just north of the ZZZ1 area as we made our way towards ZZZ. We referenced the FOM for this procedure. Upon completion of the fuel dump we still needed to burn additional fuel so ATC gave us vectors on arrival. Again; we made another announcement to the passengers advising them of the personnel that would be following us to the gate in the interest of safety so that they would not be alarmed.We completed all checklists; continued to ZZZ without event; landed under our max landing weight; Flaps 20; with vehicles standing by for safety. After landing we taxied to gate. Our right side brakes entered the caution zone on the taxi in and we relayed this information to the crews for monitoring.

Unfortunately since we were in the descent on the arrival things were getting busy and as we no longer had LNAV or VNAV; unreliable airspeed and altitude we [advised ATC]. We were unable to restore autopilot; autothrottle; LNAV or VNAV. We were now at approximately 11;000 ft. on a left downwind for landing 34R into ZZZ. We realized the engines were running fine in the alternate mode and told ATC we would require vectors to the 34R approach. The weather was broken clouds at about 4000 ft. with good visibility. Just abeam the airport as we descended out of 11;000 ft. my First Officer said his airspeed had returned to normal and matched mine. We got a vector to the base leg and descended through 9000 ft. and were able to get out of the clouds and visually see the runway. We continued the visual approach and landed on XXR.

As the aileron deflection required was excessive I was evaluating whether the wind was causing the flight control manipulation required or was the trim off. I scanned the trim settings and everything was centered. As we climbed I determined that lots of rudder trim was needed. I hand flew the airplane whilst attempting to bring it into trim. As the amount of trim needed was getting excessive we scanned the engine indications and flap configuration to see if we had an issue and everything was normal. We continued the climb as we were evaluating the issue. The fuel was balanced and nothing appeared abnormal; we had no hydraulic; feel control warnings etc. Once I reached about 5 units of Left rudder trim the AC was able to fly more level but still had about 2 units of Left aileron deflection. Eventually; around 7 units were needed for a relatively level flight. I engaged the auto pilot and discussed the situation with the First Officer (FO). I passed Pilot Flying (PF) duties to the FO and had him see if he concurred with the present control configuration (the trim we had was required) and he did. I contacted [maintenance] via ACARS and [flight operations] informing them of our situation. Now at altitude I decided to disconnect the Auto Pilot and while hand flying had the FO slowly take out some rudder trim to evaluate if I had mistrimmed or over trimmed. It became apparent quickly that the trim was needed as aileron deflection increased correspondingly. We discussed that the trim was now about where it was when we pre flighted the aircraft. We now thought that that was where it was left by the previous crew and not inadvertently moved as originally thought. A quick review of the flight manual revealed no non normal procedure for this situation. We discussed the situation and whether or not to divert. As this was way out of the normal range for trim and no other abnormalities were present we suspected that the aircraft had a flight control rigging issue. We were concerned that if this condition worsened or we developed any other issue we could easily be put beyond the ability to control the aircraft and decided to [request priority handling]. I had no response from [maintenance] at this point. We made the decision to [request priority handling] and divert. I choose ZZZ1 as it was close; had a long runway; emergency services and lastly customer services. We knew this was going to require an overweight landing but did not think it prudent to burn down as that would have taken hours. Dispatch was informed and quickly got back to us acknowledging the divert and situation. We briefed the plan; the approach; got landing data and considerations for the overweight condition.

ZZZZZ1 arrival into ZZZ at FL200 given clearance to descend to 15000 feet by ZZZZZ2. I entered 15000 ft. as a constraint on the FMS and immediately we got a CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULT ECAM message and an OFFSIDE FMS CONTROL on the ND. The AP1 decoupled from NAV mode without any warning or indication and reverted to HDG mode. ECAM procedure said to check landing elevation. Altimeters were set on 29.64 for field setting and landing elevation knob was set to AUTO. Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) had no additional procedures. Captain (CA) FMS was locked and no key selections or line selects would result in any change on FMS display. We alerted ATC to our NAV failure and requested vectors. We transferred controls to the First Officer (FO). We selected AP2 and regained NAV mode. We also determined that the CA ND was visible if the range was set to the same as the FO. We accomplished the Descent checklist and loaded and confirmed the RNAV GPS XXR. We asked for and received an extended vector to final with approach. Upon matching ND range with a good display on the CA side we transferred controls back to the CA. The aircraft was configured for landing between ZZZZZ3 and ZZZZZ4 and was fully configured and stable by ZZZZZ4. Crosswind was approximately 330/25 at around 1000 ft. with a substantial crab and reported by Tower to be 330/9 at the runway. Aircraft was stable at 1000 ft. Approaching the minimums of 520 ft.; I disconnected the Autopilot (AP) and the managed speed bug ran away and the auto-thrust surged causing the aircraft to get high and fast. The FO reached up and dialed back the speed on the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) which reduced thrust and I continued the approach making an aggressive correction to regain the glide path. This caused our speed to be excessive and our glide path to become steep below 500 ft. I had to make an immediate decision to continue or go around and I quickly decided to continue with the unknown system degradation as long as I had glide path on the VASI and the speed/thrust was not erratic. We touched down with a minor bounce and exited the runway at taxiway T. Upon touchdown; all of the ND and PFD and lower ECAM started flashing and flickering in all of the message/mode locations. We called for maintenance to meet us at the gate because we had no idea what we had as a problem. Upon talking with the mechanics we were informed that there was a triple failure within the FMS and that the mechanic had never seen that before. He indicated an FMGCU (Flight Management Guidance Control Unit) failure. The post flight maintenance report indicated a CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULT and a NAV LS TUNING DISAGREE. System degradation from the time of failure when entering /15000 ft. at ZZZZZ2 on the arrival up to and including screen flickering and flashing at touchdown was a complete unknown.

While performing the procedure we then observed the expected ECAM HYD Y ENG 2 PUMP LO PR and HYD Y RSVR LO LVL messages and followed those ECAM procedures. The FO then followed up with the QRH. I then transferred the aircraft controls to the FO and evaluated the non-routine landing considerations. We were approximately 185;000 pounds so any diversion would result in an overweight landing. I did not want to combine this with a compromised hydraulic status; so the decision was made to continue to ZZZ1 and land on the longest runway. We later received a HYD Y RSVR OVHT message and performed the ECAM procedures; and determined that it was acceptable with no Y hydraulic pumps operating and Y hydraulic level indicating zero. We informed ATC that we had a hydraulic system malfunction but would be continuing to ZZZ1. ATC recommended that once we were in contact with ZZZ Center we should notify them that we would need safety vehicles standing by for Runway XXR.

We informed ATC of our loss of one hydraulic system but our intent was to continue to ZZZ1. We also sent messages to dispatch to begin coordinating necessary equipment upon arrival. Approximately 30 minutes later we received a Y HYD RSVR OVHT but determined it to be OK since we had all Y pumps off and we were indicating no HYD fluid remaining on the Y side.

I was the Captain and pilot flying on the flight [to] BOS. Flight was uneventful until short final when the actual winds and the programmed winds began to differ greatly; causing an increased mini groundspeed (Airbus gust correction) of 150 kts. vs programmed approach speed of 139. This increased ground speed; light weight; gusty winds; and delayed power reduction because of speed required; caused a ballooned flare which floated the aircraft out of the touchdown zone. Additionally; Runway 27 is only 7000 ft.; making the touchdown zone even more critical; therefore; I executed a go-around. There was a helicopter crossing departure end of 27; forcing an aggressive climb to 3000 ft. We were vectored back around for a second attempt at ILS 27; however; we were vectored 6 miles in trail of an A330 and given specific speeds that maintained that spacing on final. Due to winds of 340/13G19 and the 7000 ft. runway; the wake of the preceding A330 caused the aircraft to balloon and float out of a safe landing position again; forcing a second go-around from landing position. The go-around was uneventful; however; due to approaching reserve fuel levels; we elected to declare minimum fuel and requested vectors to Runway 33; to be more aligned with the prevailing winds and on the longer runway. Approach and landing were uneventful and we arrived at the gate with exactly 3;900 lbs. fuel; our reserve for that flight.",,"Two go arounds performed landing on Runway 27 BOS before a successful approach was conducted to 33L. Both go arounds were initiated below 50 ft.; the first of which ground contact was made during the go around. I believe the primary cause for both go arounds to be an increased reference speed due to inaccurate wind reporting at BOS. Loaded winds were 340/13g19. Airplane mini gs pushed ref speed up to 150 kts. causing excess float. This in combination with wake turbulence from a heavy on second approach prevented us from making a safe landing during first 2 events. Min fuel was declared and during 3rd approach ATC gave us updated winds of (from memory) 340/27g35. Successful landing was made.",,"A320 flight crew reported executing two go-arounds at BOS in gusty wind conditions. The second go-around also involved a wake turbulence encounter.",

The takeoff; climb; cruise; and descent went as expected. During the Descent to Approach phase; we did receive a Master Caution Light for the YAW DAMPER. The Captain ran the QRH and the resolution was to not exceed Flaps 30; End of Checklist. During the approach phase on a visual for Runway XXL; we join the localizer for XXL at ZZZZZ. I was the pilot flying (PF) so I called for 'Flaps 1' to begin to slow back to 210 kts. We had the proceeding aircraft insight and the field; so we called both 'in-sight' to ATC. We got cleared for the visual XXL following traffic and were instructed to slow back to '170 kts.' to a 5 NM Final. Given the heavy traffic congestion that night going into ZZZ1 and the proceeding traffic in-front of us; I continued to call for FLAPs 5; then Gear Down with Flaps 15; then eventually Flaps 25. The Captain mentioned that I was going too fast for Flaps 25. That's when we both noticed the Amber Ban on the Airspeed indicator was greater than our bugged speeds. At that same moment we both noticed our flaps never extended out of Flaps UP which explains why we had a hard time slowing down. We both determined we needed to Go-Around. We were instructed to turn left heading 250 and maintain 4;000. We executed the missed approach procedure and reconfigured the airplane to level flight. I turned on the Autopilot and kept my speed around 210 kts. Not having too much fuel onboard (had around 6;000 pounds of fuel) I didn't want to get too far away from the airport as we were problem solving the flap issue. Once reaching clean configuration; the Captain gave me the airplane and he ran the QRH to determine what the problem was. Talking with ATC; I knew we had some sort of FLAP Malfunction and told him we will need Runway XXR. I started to set up the aircraft for the ILS XXR. After a few short vectors; the Captain determined we should plan for a FLAPS UP landing. We gathered FLAPS UP landing numbers and re-bugged the aircraft. The approach and landing went as planned. We touchdown and exited around Taxiway 1 in ZZZ1 where we had the fire trucks waiting for us. We had the fire trucks follow us into the ramp area to make sure everything looked good on the airplane. After entering the ramp area and executing the after landing check; everything looked normal to us. We asked the ramp to [for] the fire trucks to be waived off. We arrived at the gate and completed our post flight duties and then contacted Dispatch and the Duty Pilot.",,"To my recollection these are the pertinent details as to the event my crew and I experienced on the night ZZZ2-ZZZ1. During decent we got a master caution flight control. The yaw dampener had disengaged. I referenced the QRH and followed the steps to resolution. We continued the descent for a visual approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ1. We were vectored behind traffic to follow which appeared to us both was very close and decided we needed to configure and slow down for spacing. We began that process but I feel my concern for our relative proximity to our traffic to follow led me to not verify that the selected flaps were in the correct position. At some point I noticed the speed tapes on my display did not look right. Initially I considered an unreliable airspeed situation but cross check of all the available indications made me realize that the flaps had not moved to their selected position. The indication was they hadn't moved at all. I then instructed my First Officer (FO) to accelerate to clean maneuver speed and start a gentle missed approach. Which he did. ATC gave us a heading and altitude to maintain and when we were stable I asked my FO to maintain aircraft control while I tried to decipher the problem. I attempted to contact Maintenance and Dispatch but the radio chatter between Operations and other aircraft impeded that process. Even with years of experience and high quality training I failed to find the proper checklist. At that point considering where we were and the conditions at ZZZ1 that I would pull data for a no flap landing on Runway XXR. The data was very favorable so I decided to use my Captain's authority to take that course of action. We briefed the new plan and associated threats. We set up for and requested to land on XXR. At 500 ft. we got a ground proximity warning because of our flap position and inhibited it because we knew why. If I had found the proper checklist that step would have been accomplished. Landing at that point was assured and all other items for landing were reconfirmed. The FO executed a successful no flap landing and we taxied clear of the runway and to our gate. After the shutdown checklist we debriefed the event. I realized then that the flaps disagree checklist would have diagnosed the problem and led us to use alternate flaps. We then would've been properly configured and completed the landing checklist correctly. I know I failed to find the proper course of action and am very disappointed at myself. However; after deciding on the course of action that we took I had full confidence in a favorable outcome with a safe landing.",,"B737 flight crew reported a yaw damper fail message and flap malfunction while on approach.

Immediate action items were followed and Tower was notified of rejection. I made the decision to roll to the end of the runway in hopes the brakes would be less likely to overheat considering in part aircraft weight /speed and runway length. We cleared runway at end and I stopped aircraft on parallel taxiway to complete checklists and assess brake conditions. The fire personnel had been notified and were proceeding to aircraft as we stopped on taxiway. I believe Tower personnel had made that notification to the fire personnel. We were in contact with Fire/ Rescue personnel commander on VHF 2. The brake temperatures eventually began to rise and the Fire/Rescue lead could see some smoke and at some point said possibly a flame; they sprayed water on wheel truck. This produced immediate results and temperatures were lowered and no further visible smoke or fire evidence. I did not feel evacuation was necessary and the Fire/Rescue lead agreed with that judgment as well as Copilot's. At some point Fire/Rescue advised the number 2 tire had deflated as a protection.

We followed the checklist; which directs you to cycle flaps to 1; and back to off. This step did not clear the malfunction. The checklist directs a flaps 15 landing; and calls for a Non-Normal configuration landing distance. Since we had run the QRH; and were computing a non-normal landing distance; we decided to divert to ZZZ1 vs. returning to ZZZ2 or continuing on to ZZZ3. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ (QRH + Non-normal landing made this seem like the right choice). They put us on the ZZZZZ arrival for the ILS Runway X. Descent; approach; and landing were uneventful. I had the FO land the aircraft. Aircraft configuration was normal for a landing. We lowered the landing gear about 1/2 way to ZZZ1 to reduce landing weight; about 155000 lbs. at take-off. I referenced the Overweight Landing checklist; and computed landing distance about 6000 ft. at 150000 lbs. landing weight. Actual landing weight was 149000 lbs.; touchdown was normal. I made MEL entries for the flap malfunction and the overweight landing. I had coordinated the diversion with Dispatch via ACARS during the flight; and I called to discuss the event after landing to include the overweight landing. We changed aircraft and continued on to ZZZ3.Weather at ZZZ2 was heavy rain; wet runway; braking action medium on arrival. Based on the ZZZ2 weather; we had pre briefed using ZZZ1 as our recovery base for a malfunction on take-off. ZZZ1 had been our alternate for the flight inbound to ZZZ2; so we had relatively current ZZZ1 weather and NOTAMs available. Two procedural suggestions for the QRH as posted.

Once armed; we received multiple EICAS messages (3 pages) of system failures. I lost background lighting and multiple instruments. I looked up at the electrical panel and noted the STBY PWR OFF Light illuminated. After requesting priority handling; I handed the Paper QRH to the International Relief Officer and instructed her to read the Standby Power Off checklist. We complied with the checklist and continued the approach to an uneventful landing.On rollout; I took control of the aircraft; and through 100 kts.; felt the airplane being sluggish. I stated I thought we had blown tires; as our inboard tires had no anti-skid protection. We cleared the runway; and noted the break temp monitors were at 9 on my outboard brakes. I called Tower to ensure services were enroute; and wanted them to focus on our main landing gear in case of fire. Once ensured there was no fire; I contacted Ops; Dispatch; Maintenance Control to make everyone aware of our situation. After approximately 30 minutes I was informed that all 8 main tires were flat. Air stairs were brought to the aircraft; and all passengers and crew egressed with no injuries. We were taken by bus to the main terminal.Before leaving the aircraft; an ELB write up was accomplished. Upon further investigation of the logbook's history; I see there was a similar write up of a 'hard power transfer' when the approach mode was selected with multiple EICAS messages. In their case; they never lost STBY PWR; as in mine. Seems there was an electric anomaly with this jet that was never found by Maintenance. In my opinion; the paper QRH should not be removed from our aircraft; as it was the fastest means for us to accomplish a lengthy checklist before landing; as this problem presented itself at a very inopportune moment on approach.This is an addendum to a previous report. It was brought to my attention after landing that the speed brakes failed to deploy; and the crew missed that fact with all our attention focused on failed systems; checklists; and flying the airplane. Upon landing my focus was squarely on keeping the airplane tracking the runway center line. In the end; with the length of runway; I do not believe the speed brakes were a factor in the final outcome of the flight.",,,,"B767 Captain reported a hard power transfer caused the loss of multiple systems.

It was quickly realized that the gear would not retract so a joint decision was made to divert to ZZZ1. Involved in this decision was the fact that ZZZ1 has many long Runways and company Maintenance facilities. During this time as the Captain was working the ECAM the gear doors were stuck down and making a lot of noise within the flight deck.

I asked to have it released so I could review the aircraft issue. He declined. Maintenance was at the gate; they removed the Maintenance Discrepancy. I reviewed the original write ups which appeared to start at the end of month with the last one on Date. The write ups described a lot of noise through 270 knots with slight airframe vibration.

The Flight Attendant (FA) stated 'there's a fire in the cabin and a lot of smoke; I'll call you back'. My First Officer (FO) and I looked at the engine instruments and pressurization panels; everything looking normal. My FO pulled the QRC and QRH. I [requested special handling] and requested radar vector for a diversion to ZZZ1; which was about 80 miles off our nose.When I got back to my FO; he briefed me on the situation. A passenger had a small electronic device inside her purse; filling the cabin with smoke. They pulled and used the fire extinguisher; reached to the device and put it in a containment bag. I made the decision to deviate from our company procedures; which call for running the QRC/QRH because the source of the smoke was determined and they were no smoke or smell in the flight deck. My concern was to land the aircraft at the most suitable airport in point of time since the FA was still concerned by the smell.We believe the smell was the residual from the fire extinguisher discharge; but I could be wrong and didn't want to delay the landing. We set up the approach; ran the appropriate checklists and received [landing data] for an overweight landing. The Fire Department made a wheel well inspection and convened with Dispatch that it was safe to park at the gate with the parking brake off. I want to commend our Flight Attendants for the way they handled the situation. They kept us informed of the development of the incident; which helped us in our assessments. We didn't have to second guess and run the risk of calling for the wrong check lists. My FO did a tremendous job of being the liaison between the FA and myself; allowing me to focus on flying the aircraft first. He also kept the passengers informed of our intention.",,"I was the First Officer on Aircraft X; ZZZ2-ZZZ on Date. We were cruising at FL 360 between the ZZZ VOR and ZZZZZ intersection; southeast of ZZZ1; when we received a call from the Flight Attendants that there was 'a fire in the cabin and there is a lot of smoke; we'll call you right back.' A quick scan of our engine instruments and the pressurization panel indicated no abnormalities; and we did not detect any smoke or fumes in the cockpit. The Captain told me that we should [request special handling] with ATC; and we quickly discussed that we were close to ZZZ1 and that would likely be the most suitable airport to land. The Flight Attendants called me back and they advised me that they had identified the source of the smoke; a passenger had a portable battery charger in their purse to charge their cell phone and that it was overheating and causing the smoke in the cabin. While I spoke with them; my Captain [requested special handling] with ATC and we received a vector towards ZZZ1. Shortly after; we were cleared direct to the ZZZ1 airport and had a descent clearance. I had pulled out the QRC and the QRH in preparation for the Smoke/Fire/Fumes Checklist; however we ended up deviating from company policy due to the fact that our Flight Attendant's had identified the source of the smoke/fumes and that there was no smoke or fumes present in the cockpit. Our priority was to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. While this was happening; the Flight Attendants attempted to extinguish the battery with a Halon fire extinguisher with no result. They quickly determined that they should use the lithium battery containment bag that we have on the aircraft. They ended up taking the passenger's purse with the battery in it and placed it in the containment bag and doused it with water that they had available in the cabin. Once they did that; they informed me that the battery was contained and under control and that the smoke was clearing out of the cabin. I asked if there were any passengers having breathing issues or if anyone was injured and they replied 'no; not at this time.' I asked them to keep me advised if any passengers were having issues breathing and that we were diverting to ZZZ1. I then focused on our descent into ZZZ1 and getting the aircraft safely on the ground. I gathered the ATIS information and then ran our Performance Data for ZZZ1. We loaded the approach for Runway XXR into the FMC and did a Quick Approach Briefing. [Landing date] came back and said we would be overweight for landing and to run the [brake cooling procedures]. I proceeded to run the brake cooling and it returned data stating that we would need one hour of brake cooling without the parking brake set and that we should notify ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to come and perform a visual inspection of the landing gear after landing. Once we arrived on the ground in ZZZ1 quickly and safely; we exited the runway with ZZZ1 ARFF following us. They performed a visual inspection of our landing gear and wheel wells and advised us that our brake temperatures were within the normal range and that they observed no abnormalities. My Captain then called Dispatch while we were stopped on the taxiway to confirm whether or not we needed to remain off the gate for the full one hour; and it was determined that we would be OK to taxi to the gate; but we would need to be chocked at the gate and leave the parking brake released. We then taxied to Gate X without further incident.I would like to recognize my Captain for staying calm and collected throughout the entire event. He kept the aircraft under control and we performed a safe landing in ZZZ1. I would also like to commend our Flight Attendants for their extraordinary actions that quickly brought the entire situation under control and prevented what could have been a fire spreading throughout the cabin and becoming a very bad situation.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a battery charger experienced a thermal runaway during cruise.

We were about to start our ZZZZZ arrival over ZZZ1. During our cruise systems check; we discovered the oil quantity indication on the ENG2 appeared to be lower than usual. ENG1;16 qt. ENG2; 6.5 qt. I decided to contact Dispatch for a Maintenance Control consultation. This communication with Dispatch was through SATCOM with a few failed attempts at least twice since we got the failure messages on the FMGC and the call dropping or a weak voice from the Dispatcher. I also tried through ZZZ1 Dispatch VHF XXX.X. When I did this; I accidentally tune the frequency on VHF 1 out from ZZZ Center; but flipped the ZZZ frequency back to it.When we finally got hold Maintenance Control through SATCOM; at that time the oil quantity was at 5.5 on ENG2. I explained our situation and concern with Maintenance Control and a possible engine leak and the trend of oil quantity; recommending to divert to ZZZ1 for a precautionary landing. At that present moment we had an ECAM advisory caution for ENG2 oil qty; 5 qt. Since Maintenance Control concurred with our plan for diverting to ZZZ1 we informed to ATC and continued our descent to divert. Another consideration to this decision was the marginal weather at ZZZ2; with light rain and low ceilings with a front coming into the area. The weather at ZZZ1 was VFR. The inflight and customers were briefed for the divert due to oil engine indication. We were vectored around for our sequence into ZZZ1; RNAV XXL. At this time; a priority was not declared yet.As we continued our descent at low power setting; the oil quantity ECAM advisory for ENG2 was still present and decreasing; 4.5qt. At that time; [priority handling was requested] and the inflight were briefed for a code yellow. We started the APU for systems redundancy. Once we were approximately 15 miles final and cleared for the RNAV XXL approach; our oil quantity for ENG2 was as low as 2qt at leveled off and temperature rising; I believe it was 138 C and increasing; if I remember correctly. It was evident; this was an oil engine leak and not an indication issue. Concerned about an engine damage and having an ECAM warning during short final a busy phase of flight; we performed a precautionary engine 2 shutdown; thrust lever 2 idle and engine master 2 off followed by completing the ECAM actions procedures. We continued the approach and the landing was uneventful. Once cleared of the runway; we briefly stopped at the taxiway for fire and rescue staff inspect the engine 2; if there was any visible damage. They discovered no damage but an apparent minor oil leak from the bottom of the engine. It took only a few minutes to asses this situation before we taxied to the gate. Upon arrival; we met with tech ops and gave them details of our situation. They commented that it was good we salvaged the engine; the oil leak was quite visible and evident once the cowlings were open. Finalizing my narrative; in spite of the circumstances; a rapid decreasing oil quantity on ENG2; [First Officer] and I did our best on bringing the airplane safely on the ground at ZZZ1 where the weather was favorable. It was an overwhelming situation trying to get hold of Dispatch or maintenance at the beginning due to the SATCOM connection issue and the time constraint. But at the end everything was accomplished safe and professional.However; in retrospect. I was really concentrated on getting the aircraft on the ground quickly once [priority handling was requested]. I would have emphasize on a potential precautionary engine shutdown during the approach briefing. It seemed that even though that my FO and I had a continuous dialogue and talking out aloud as we were descending to ZZZ1 we saw ourselves making a last minute decision for a precautionary engine shutdown. Perhaps doing the engine shutdown earlier would have gotten more time to review the contingencies for the flight. In-spite of how comfortable I feel flying the A320 this was a definitely a learning experience for me to manage my time accordingly.",,"During our flight from ZZZ3 to ZZZ2; somewhere close to top of descent; the Captain who was the Pilot Flying (PF) brought to my attention the oil quantity level for our number 2 engine. The oil quantity was significantly lower than engine number 1 by about 10 quarts and this was causing some concern. The Captain elected to contact maintenance and Dispatch with his concerns and loop them into the situation and determine an appropriate course of action. After conferring with Maintenance Control; we elected to divert to ZZZ1 which was close by instead of continuing on to our destination as the oil quantity kept decreasing significantly faster than a normal burn rate; as well as the advisory message on the ECAM showing 5 quarts of oil in engine number 2. While on the patch with Maintenance Control and during reduced workload I consulted the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to see if there was any specific guidance for low oil quantity but I was unable to find any. The weather in ZZZ2 also aided in our decision being marginal and ZZZ1 having better weather. ATC was informed of our decision and intention to divert to as well as the reason and we were given a further decent as well as answering the typical questions; 'were we [requesting priority handling] at this time?; reason for the divert decision; if we needed any assistance?'. At this time we elected not to [request priority handling]; but did request one shortly after in order to get priority handling and get the aircraft on the ground as quickly and safely as we could. The customers and in-flight were also briefed. While being vectored into ZZZ1 we noticed the oil quantity was still decreasing reaching as low as 2 quarts. While thinking aloud and in the interest of safety and not wanting the oil quantity to completely reach 0 quarts and to prevent any damage to the engine or have it malfunction during this critical phase of flight; we decided an engine shutdown would be the best course of action last minute and the associated ECAM actions were accomplished. This was done as not to add any more complexity to the situation and we continued in for a single engine landing which was accomplished by the Captain uneventfully and flawlessly. Upon exiting the runway CFR which was standing by inspected the number two engine and did let us know that there was some oil they could see on the cowling of the engine.

I saw an amber flash on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) but didn't see what it was. I assumed it was the altimeter reminder to go to STD; but noticed we were below 18000 ft. As we approached 18000 ft. and went to standard; the 'AS DISAGREE' illuminated with approximately 8 kts. variance between my PFD and the First Officer's (FO). I continued to fly while I asked the FO to get out the checklist. We ran the QRC and followed up with the QRH and continued the climb while running the initial checklist. As we climbed; the disparity grew greater eventually close to 20 kts. At that point the engine instruments went to '-' s and I told ATC we were returning ZZZ. I briefed the Flight Attendants; Dispatch; ATC and the passengers. I opted to [request priority handling] so we wouldn't have to fly the STAR back in and because it would be an overweight landing. I got a bit task saturated on final. As we were configuring on final; we were gear down and flaps 25 by about 2;000 ft.; but I was late getting fully configured to flaps 30 at approximately 800 ft. due to talking to ATC about our intentions and ZZZ command procedures.It was a very benign event initially but got more intense as we were procedurally directed to turn off the autothrottles and as we continued to climb briefly. Then got distracted and slightly late configuring to final flaps below 1000 ft. In retrospect; I should have let the FO fly since he had the correct info displayed; instead of just making his flight director the master and using that.",,"Uneventful up this event. During out climbout on the ZZZZZ 3 SID; at approximately 16;000 ft.; I noticed an amber light on the Primary Flight Display (PFD). Knowing it was coming close to our transition altitude; I assumed without verifying that it was our altimeter reminder to set STD. Shortly after; I noticed that we weren't at 18000 ft. and the amber light had momentarily extinguished. When it came back on; realized it was the IAS Disagree light. I was the pilot monitoring so I immediately looked at all three airspeed sources and the Captain and I quickly noticed that his IAS was the one at fault and was showing about 8 kts. faster. I pulled out the QRC and QRH and ran the Airspeed Unreliable checklist and confirmed with the IAS disagree checklist which directed me to the Airspeed Unreliable checklist. The Captain elected to fly while I did the checklists and facilitated the return to ZZZ with ATC. As we continued the climb while working the checklist and our game plan; the error with the IAS grew to as much as 20 kts. When that happened; we also lost some of our engine instruments. This solidified that we needed to return much sooner and elected for an overweight landing rather than burn down fuel. The Captain continued to fly and I ran the QRH and coordinated the [priority] return. As we descended; the IAS and the engine instruments returned to normal indications. The rest of the descent and landing was uneventful. After landing; we precautionary went to a holding pad to have safety vehicles view the aircraft and the brakes to ensure no hot bakes situations existed before returning to the gate. Gave the plane to maintenance and debriefed them. I am not aware of any causal factors that we played a roll in. The event was very benign and only got worse the higher we climbed as we were already running the checklist. After we saw it getting worse; we immediately coordinated for our return and ATC approved a decent which helped alleviate the deviations. After the flight; the Captain and I debriefed the event and both agreed that a transfer of the aircraft to the FO with the good displays would have been a better decision; inline with current SOP. Otherwise; since it was mechanical; there wasn't anything we could do to prevent this from happening again.",,"B737-800 flight crew reported they received an Airspeed Disagree warning followed by other instruments failing so they returned to the departure airport and made an overweight landing.",

We discussed it briefly and noted that we would watch for any abnormalities.On takeoff; at gear retraction; we all noticed an increased odd noise from under the aircraft and also an unusual slight vibration. We did get a similar EICAS msg that illuminated briefly; but gear and flap retraction seemed normal. Enroute portion of the flight was normal.During the approach into ZZZZ; as flaps were extended; they came out normally to Flaps 1; but we heard a slightly unusual noise. As Flaps 5 were selected; a flaps EICAS appeared; followed very shortly afterwards by a Hyd EICAS message; C Hyd Press. At this point; the Captain as pilot monitoring (PM) selected the status page and we saw C Hyd quantity dropping through about 50% and dropped within a few seconds to zero.We broke off the approach and asked for a place to go to work the issue. We were given a climb and a hold at ZZZZ1. Once safely climbing and then established in Holding; the Captain and I referenced the QRH for C Hyd Press and the First Officer (FO) acted as pilot flying (PF). We elected to get the flaps out to 5 right away via the alternate system. We then reviewed the remainder of the checklist noting the need to extend flaps and gear via alternate system; and that; depending on the results of follow-on steps; may not have steering and require a tow to the gate. As Relief Pilot; I made the initial contact with the Flight Attendants (no Prep); the Captain coordinated with ATC for a long final and the possibility of stopping on the runway.

I transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer and started the low oil quantity QRH procedure. This led us into the engine low oil pressure QRH. We did not yet meet the criteria to perform an intentional shutdown because the oil pressure was not in the red yet. I contacted dispatch via the crew phone app and had them patch me to maintenance to consult on the issue. While on the phone the oil pressure began to drop in and out of the red. We then discontinued the call to complete the QRH for engine shutdown. While on the phone dispatch did advise that ZZZ1 and ZZZ2 were the two closest airports and provided the weather at each. The weather at the time was rain in ZZZ2 and clear in ZZZ1 so I advised dispatch we would be proceeding to ZZZ1. We completed the QRH for engine shutdown and then advised ATC of the [urgent] condition. While I was on the phone with dispatch the First Officer and advised ATC we may have to divert and that we had the oil issue. He had also already looked at our single engine altitude. We requested FL220 and descended. ATC cleared us direct to ZZZ1. In the descent; I completed the QRH for one engine inoperative landing and the Non-Routine Landing Considerations. I advised both the cabin crew and the passengers we would be making a precautionary landing in ZZZ1. I then took the flight controls back from the First Officer.We continued to ZZZ1 and requested vectors to the ILS XX. We conducted the ILS in VFR conditions to a landing without incident. Safety vehicles inspected the aircraft on the runway and escorted us to the gate. Once at the gate we contacted Dispatch and maintenance to advise them of our status. No significant factors other than a loss of oil. No suggestions for the event however coordination of the deadhead flights for the crew was a bit scattered.

Shortly after; I assumed control of the aircraft and radios; while the Captain started QRH procedures for Engine low quantity.During the QRH process; I informed ZZZ Center of an impending engine shut down due to loss of oil pressure and will keep ATC advised; I also used the FMC to calculate an engine out drift down altitude of 22;000 ft. The Captain then reached out to Maintenance Control for guidance as the current aircraft conditions did not meet QRH procedures for a precautionary shut down. During this time; Captain has asked me to start looking for a diversion airfield; I referenced Jeppesen charts for suitable fields and after asking ATC for help in obtaining the current weather and runway in use; I elected ZZZZ as the prime candidate since it also had medical and company presence. Shortly after; we resumed QRH procedures as the oil pressure indications continued to drop from amber to red; resulting in an inflight shutdown. The Captain and I agreed ZZZZ was the best suitable; and after coordination with dispatch; the captain [requested priority handling] and we changed routing to ZZZZ. ATC cleared us to descend to 22;000 ft. initially and I trimmed the aircraft for the descent and slowed the aircraft to 280 kts. to give us additional time to complete all checklists; I also set up the approach in the FMC while the Captain addressed the cabin crew of the issue and informed the passengers of the diversion.After the Captain finished his tasks; I informed him of the speed; and trim setting and transferred control of the aircraft to him; we also briefed the approach (flap override; higher descent rate; go-around considerations etc.) As the aircraft descended lower; I called the cabin crew to check if all is fully seated; cooled the cabin further and briefed them on ETA and flight conditions.Upon contacting ZZZZ Approach/ATC; we were given a different approach and unfavorable vectors; we requested the ILS XX and informed them our intentions of widened and delayed turns. The aircraft was stable on the path outside the FAF and landed with a full stop on the Runway. While the Captain addressed the passengers over the PA; I informed ATC to let emergency vehicles approach and inspect right side of the aircraft. After we received the thumbs up from Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) ground personnel; we taxied the aircraft to the gate and deplaned the passengers. After approval from the Chief Pilot; we returned to the flight deck and assisted ground personnel in towing the aircraft off the gate; to parking it at an Apron and shut it down completely. I was well rested for the sequence and was alert; the Captain was great in directing and keeping everyone informed. The flight deck and cabin crew had excellent CRM leading to the safe outcome of the flight. QRH dictates to verify Oil pressure to drop below red line before proceeding to inflight shut-down; the time it takes can delay decision making.

Captain called Dispatch/Maintenance Control to discuss. FOB seemed to be decreasing at an abnormal rate. We decided to return back to origin with alternative airports as options if needed. At this point; through the conversations that were had; there was some confusion as to if this was an actual fuel leak. With both wing tanks being balanced and maintaining balance through center tank transferring along with some raised doubting questions in regards to it being an indicator problem instead of fuel leak. This led us to not further the QRH procedure past the step of being a confirmed fuel leak. We continued to origin airport. Below 10;000 ft. we started slowing to 210 kts. and while engines were at idle; there was a yawing motion with some vibration followed by an ENG 1 FAIL message. We completed ECAM action items; [requested priority handling]; briefed inflight crew on briefing items for our situation; and briefed the passengers. After landing; Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) assessed our engine and with no fire risk; we continued to the gate. Airport Operations was advised to make aware to Maintenance Control of the engine failure.",,"About 50 minutes into the flight ZZZ to ZZZ1 at FL350 we had an ECAM message FUEL F. USED/FOB DISAGREE. The First Officer (FO) pilot monitoring (PM) did some calculations and it was determined that we were indeed loosing fuel at about 500 pounds every 15 minutes. This led to a QRH procedure for FUEL LEAK and we could not ascertain the leak source including asking inflight to look out for anything obvious but inflight reported that they did not see anything leaking. After a call with Dispatch and Maintenance Control we decided to turn around and divert back to ZZZ. We showed estimated fuel on board at ZZZ above 13500 but steadily decreasing out of the left tank. Fuel imbalance was about 2000 pounds at ZZZ. All engine indications were normal including fuel flows. If we needed a good Divert airport along our route we could divert to ZZZ1 if needed. After briefing Inflight and passengers a normal approach and ILS XXL was executed until about 9000 ft. on XXL approach we got a ENG 1 FAIL. We [requested priority handling] at this point and accomplished as much of the ECAM procedure as we had time. An uneventful single engine approach and landing were accomplished. Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) looked over the left engine after landing and nothing adverse was seen. We taxied into the gate and deplaned normally. On the post flight walk around we noticed fuel dripping from the bottom of the number one engine cowl.",,"A321 flight crew reported fuel issue followed by engine failure inflight.",

I was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the Captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). It was a rainy night with now Post-Tropical Storm pushing through the area. Upon reaching roughly 400-500 ft.; just before we were getting ready to make the right turn on the ZZZZZ SID; we heard multiple load bangs come from the #2 Engine. These bangs were accompanied with fluctuating engine parameters on #2 and a loss of power. This happened a few more times as we were analyzing the situation. Shortly after; we received the ENG 2 STALL ECAM; to which we followed and brought ENG 2 to Idle. Once at Idle; the ENG 2 parameters were normal and we had no indication of fire or damage. We didn't see or hear any birds hitting the aircraft; so we didn't believe we ingested anything into ENG 2. Since we had no idea why ENG 2 stalled; we wanted to get on the ground ASAP due to fear of ENG 1 stalling as well. After we completed the ECAM; we immediately begun our return to ZZZ. The Captain and I delegated duties prior to running the ECAM; and I continued as pilot flying and took over the radios; while the Captain first worked the ECAM; and then began to prepare for our return to ZZZ. We requested an immediate return to ZZZ and [requested priority handling]. We climbed to 3;000 ft. and received vectors back to Runway XX at ZZZ which we had loaded into the Secondary Flight Plan.The Captain was in communication with the Flight Attendants and made them aware of the situation. They actually called us as the stall was happening. The Captain gave them the briefing and prepared them for our return. The Captain made a PA to the passengers to advise them of what happened and that we were returning to ZZZ. The Captain loaded the new flight plan back to ZZZ; sent for landing numbers; and coordinated our return with operations. While heading back to ZZZ; the Flight Attendants called again advising us that a passenger had passed out. We relayed this information to ATC and made sure paramedics would be waiting at the gate. Since we had no reason to believe there was any fire or damage; we elected to taxi off the runway and to the gate upon landing in ZZZ. ATC cleared all traffic out of our way and vectored us back to Runway XX in ZZZ. We were just under Max Landing Weight for the A321. After a successful landing on Runway XX; we taxied to the gate. Once off the runway; we communicated with Operations to make sure everything was ready for us and paramedics were standing by; which they were. Once we were able to get the passenger who passed out medical attention; we deplaned under normal procedures. From takeoff to landing; we were back on the ground in 16 minutes.",,"Shortly after departing [Runway] XXR at ZZZ; and climbing through approximately 400 ft.-500 ft. AGL; loud bangs were heard from engine 2. The First Officer and myself began to assess the situation; and noticed large fluctuations with the number 2 engine instruments. Shortly following these events; we received an ENG 2 STALL ECAM. We had just about reached our required turn on the ZZZZZ departure; but elected to deviate straight out per the engine fail procedure. [Priority handling was requested] with Departure; and we requested to return to ZZZ for Runway XX. After applying the ECAM procedures; the engine parameters returned to normal after setting idle thrust on engine 2; and the ECAM extinguished. Company was notified of the situation via Operations frequency; the Flight Attendants were briefed and the passengers were informed by a PA announcement. Just prior to landing; we were informed by the flight attendants that a passenger had passed out. We passed this information on to ATC as well as operations and requested EMT assistance at the gate. After landing; we elected to taxi off the runway and proceed to the gate. Immediately after clearing the runway; I made a PA announcement to remind everyone to remain seated with their seat belts fastened.

QRH procedures were followed to an engine shutdown with a subsequent divert to ZZZ.At the time we were going by ZZZ off to our left and could see the field clearly. The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF) and I the pilot not flying (PNF). We confirmed the problem to make sure we were doing the correct checklist and I immediately [requested priority handling] with ATC and we descended to the engine out altitude for the aircraft. In the descent we went through the Engine LOW PRESSURE checklist. This directed us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist which was run next. After confirming the checklist was appropriate I completed the checklist to step 15 where it directed to go on to the one engine inoperative landing checklist.At this time and also during the checklist I kept cross checking with the FO and contacted dispatch to confirm ZZZ was a good divert field. The FO kept flying and descending to ZZZ. I briefed the Flight Attendants with the briefing and told them to plan for a normal landing. Dispatch ensured that emergency equipment would be available. I made a PA to inform the passengers that we had an engine problem and had to shut it down and would be landing in ZZZ. ATC gave us about 5-10 minutes of delay vectors as I went through the checklists.The One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist was completed to deferred items where the FO and I came together again to brief the ILS approach to XR. The deferred items were completed and when we were ready the FO flew a nice single engine approach and landing to XR. We cleared the runway and had emergency vehicles go over the plane for any possible hot brakes or fire and then taxied to the gate.Things that could have gone better:During the descent when I was running the checklist we passed FL180 and the FO made the call for altimeters set. I set the altimeters but did not turn on the landing lights. It was such a nice night and ZZZ airport and XR was so bright it didn't even occur to me until the landing roll that they were off. It was a mistake on my part and the workload I was under at the time contributed to the mistake.I also did not give a lot of consideration to the fact that we were going to land at max structural weight or over by a few hundred pounds. I should have briefed the FO that we would be. He made a nice landing and Maintenance asked me after the flight to add in that we made a normal landing in the Maintenance write up.

Per SOP we completed the overweight landing QRH and also referenced the diversion guide material. The HYD G RSVR LO LVL QRH lead us into the alternate gear extension which we accomplished successfully. After we landed and exited the Runway I stopped the aircraft on Taxiway 1 and set the parking brake. I requested crash and rescue for an inspection of the aircraft for any indication of hot spots; excessive brake temperatures; or smoke before we proceed to the Gate. I made a PA to the passengers not to be alarmed by emergency vehicles around the aircraft as it's a normal procedure after an event like this. Once at the Gate; the parking brake was set and the parking checklist was completed. During the parking checklist; the First Officer and I could smell hydraulic fluid in the flight deck. Once Maintenance came on board and asked about the event we explained to him what happened; and he verified that there was little hydraulic fluid left in the reservoir. A post flight walk around was performed to confirm if any visible hydraulic fluid was coming from the aircraft. During our inspection we observed hydraulic fluid leaking from the back of the number 1 engine; under the belly of the aircraft; and also pooling of fluid on the Ramp as well. After the event; operations advised us of a tail swap to take our customer to ZZZ1. The First Officer and I made a self assessment of fitness to continue and with coordination with crew services determined we were legal. The subsequent flight was complicated uneventfully and landed safely at the destination 'ZZZ1' approximately 3 hrs behind schedule without further issue.",,,,"A321 Captain reported normal flight operations until about FL250 when we received caution messages on the ECAM HYD G RSVR LO LVL; G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR; G SYS LO PR.

It was yawing to the left. I could feel resistance on the peddles and I thought it may have been the Captain's feet. I found out later it was not him. Right after bringing the gear up on takeoff; we got an ECAM caution message about the nose wheel steering. I can't remember the exact message. I called 'my aircraft' and focused on flying and radios while the Captain ran the checklists. We determined that the nose wheel steering was INOP. But we didn't know the position of the gear; whether straight or at a 90 degree angle. We wouldn't know until we lowered the gear. Either way; we made the decision to request priority handling and make a full stop landing in ZZZ. We requested ARFF be waiting for us. The Captain made the appropriate calls to Dispatch and Maintenance. He alerted the Flight Attendants and made the PAs to the passengers. I requested priority handling with ATC and gave them the requested information. It was a very short flight so things were moving fast. We decided to get the gear out early to see if there were any additional ECAM messages. Thankfully; there were not. We determined the nose gear was straight and that we would make a normal landing to a full stop on XXL in ZZZ. We touched down and came to a stop without incident. Crash; Fire; and Rescue was standing by. They inspected the aircraft for damage and found none. We handed them the gear pins and a push crew towed us to the Gate.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported on the takeoff roll they noticed it was difficult to keep the aircraft on center line.

ZZZ-ZZZ1. During approach to XXL at 8;000 ft.; cleared for the approach with the APPR psb armed (right around ZZZZZ); we received an ECAM for Engine 2 EGT over limit. Looking at the EGT; we had both recognized that it was in the red over 800*C. Captain commanded ECAM actions to which I had began running. It had us reduce engine 2 thrust to idle to reduce EGT which caused no change and required us to shutdown engine 2. The ECAM elected us to select engine 2 master off. Captain increased engine 1 thrust lever to MCT. Systems pages showed; to which we went through each to see what systems were effected; followed by reading the status page. Eng anti ice went on and the APU was started. After ECAM actions were complete a request for priority handling was made to ATC and a hold was requested over ZZZZZ1 at our current altitude of 8;000 ft. by Captain as I went into COM 2 to run the procedures for ENG 2 EGT over limit and ENG 2 shutdown. Getting set up in the hold at ZZZZZ1 at some point our altitude became uncaptured putting us in v/s mode. We had been -250 originally and +250 during the first turn before getting the airplane to capture 8000 ft. on the outbound leg. While I was running the COM Captain called the lead Flight Attendant to give a brief; sent an ACARS message to Dispatch; contacted ZZZ1 ops; took ATC commands and requested emergency vehicles to stand by for landing. The COM instructed for the cross bleed switch to be in the open position if performance permitted. I should have kept this in auto due to high terrain for the possibility of a go-around. After the COM was complete I had taken over ATC communication and requested our approach for the ILS XXL. As we started the approach I told the passengers we would have them on the ground in approximately 5 minutes and to remain seated with seat belts fastened. Upon landing; 'spoilers' 'reverse green' and 'decel' were called. '70 kts.' was called. Upon coming to a stop simultaneously I informed ATC we were stopping on the Runway while Captain set the parking brake and called for 'flight attendant stations'. The firetrucks did an inspection to which nothing abnormal was found. Captain announced 'remain seated remain seated remain seated'. I then asked ATC for taxi instructions back to the Gate. Emergency vehicles followed us to the Gate. Once parked and the jet bridge pulled up we were met by a Firefighter and Maintenance to which a logbook entry was made and phone calls made to both dispatch and a Chief Pilot.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported receiving an ECAM for Engine 2 EGT over limit.

The write up had been checked and signed off so I noted the issue but felt since it had been signed off that it was safe to fly. We then departed for ZZZ2 with no issues during departure. During cruise approximately 1:30 into the flight; I noticed a 500 pound imbalance in the left wing from the right wing while still using center tank fuel. We discussed the possibility of a fuel leak since a similar write up had been made on the plane the night before. We had received a 'using reserve fuel' on the FMC and the left side wing tank had 8.12 versus the right side of 8.52. The center tank had approximately 1.1-1.4 and since we were still using center tank fuel we knew that the left side should not have been reduced at that point. We talked with the Flight Attendants and had them inspect the wing for any fuel that could be coming out of the wing or engine spar. They reported that nothing appeared to be coming out of the wing. We then contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and felt it was best to divert to ZZZ. After beginning to divert we used the remaining center tank fuel at which point the left wing fuel began to drastically drop (approximately 400 pounds in about 5 minutes). At this point we decided to run the fuel leak checklist which recommended that we shut down the engine. We did that and requested priority handling. We then ran the appropriate engine out checklists and proceeded to land in ZZZ with no further incident.",,"The aircraft had overnighted in ZZZ1 and had been written up and serviced for a fuel imbalance on the inbound flight. The logbook had been closed out properly and signed off. We departed out of ZZZ1 without any issues and climbed to FL350. While at cruise (approximately 1.5 hours into flight) the Captain noticed we had a fuel Imbalance while we were still operating out of the center wing tank. We had received a 'using reserve fuel' on the FMC. The left side wing tank had 8.12 versus the right side of 8.52. center tank had approximately 1.1-1.4. We started discussing the possibility of us losing fuel on the left side. I began logging our fuel imbalance. XA55 - LT 8.12/ RT 8.52. We ensured that the appropriate fuel pumps were on and that the cross feed was closed. We coordinated with the Flight Attendants and had them inspect the wing for any fuel that could be coming out of the wing or engine spar. They reported that nothing appeared to be coming out of the wing. At this point we were monitoring the fuel imbalance and began looking at the flight manual for a potential fuel leak checklist as well as considering drift down altitudes and diversion options and contingencies. By XB11 our fuel imbalance was LT 8.01/RT 8.51. At this point we had used all center wing tank fuel and had started operating from the wing tanks. The left tank fuel was leaving the tank distinctly faster than the right tank and both engine fuel flow rates were relatively similar and normal. XB15 - LT 7.85/ RT 8.28. By this point we had already made the decision to divert to ZZZ. While heading south we separated duties. I flew while the Captain coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. In their discussion they had recommended we follow the appropriate QRH. XB24 - LT 7.34/ RT 7.74. We remained at FL350 while preceding south to ZZZ until we got to the point in the checklist where we needed to shutdown and secure the left side engine for a suspected fuel leak. The Captain continued to run the checklist and set us up for the single engine approach and landing. We coordinated with ZZZ ATC and requested priority handling and proceeded in through the arrival (originally cleared ZZZZZ 3 arrival). As we got closer to ZZZ we got assigned direct to the field and then vectors for a left downwind for XXL. We transferred fight controls so the Captain could make the landing.

Approximately halfway between ZZZ and ZZZ1; we were advised; by the Flight Attendant; that the forward lav was leaking sewage onto the floor. Sewage then began seeping into the flight deck from under the second jump seat. The First Officers bag was damaged with the sewage spill. Brown sewage was also leaking into the flight deck area behind the center pedestal. We continued into ZZZ1 for an uneventful landing. Maintenance was notified and a logbook entry was made. ZZZ1 Maintenance removed the toilet seat cover to find a leaking line that they were unable to repair. The forward lavatory was locked and deferred per MEL XX-X-XX Lavatory Not Used. About halfway into our next flight; ZZZ1 to ZZZ2; the sewage reappeared in the same areas. The Flight Attendant then called to say the lav smelled horrible and that the aircraft was unsafe to continue on. I agreed and sent a Maintenance Message informing ZZZ2 Maintenance of the issue. We landed safely in ZZZ2 and assumed the aircraft would be grounded. I contacted Maintenance through Dispatch; to tell them the Supervisor on Duty should put in a swap. I met local Maintenance and advised them of a puddle of sewage on the flight deck. I told them it was unsafe for use and they agreed saying; 'We'll take it to the hangar.' Walking to my car; I was contacted on my personal phone by Scheduling; saying I had to call Maintenance Control. I then called Maintenance Control and was told with an attitude that 'I just can't ground an aircraft and walk away; and where's the write-up?' I then replied 'hold on a second;' to which the Controller responded; 'NO YOU HOLD ON A SECOND!'I then told him that I would walk back across the street to write it up. However; it was now on a deferral and had flown around for two days without being repaired; while creating an unsafe environment for passengers and crew. He then said; 'What do you want in the logbook?'; to which I replied 'aircraft unsafe for use due to forward lavatory leaking sewage into flight deck area and Flight Attendants report forward lavatory excessive sewage smell' He then hung up. I simply didn't see the need for additional logbook write-ups when Maintenance was literally standing in a pool of sewage in the flight deck. Apparently the previous deferral didn't work. However; the Maintenance Controller was apparently unhappy with me for not re-entering the deferral??? I have never received a personal phone call; while off duty; or been treated so disrespectful; by another employee in my over XX years at this Company. The pressure and coercion to keep aircraft in service is a severe Safety issue to our passengers and crew. The Maintenance Controller should be removed from duty and retrained. Personally contacting a Captain to tell him he can't ground an aircraft without a logbook entry; is promoting a hostile; unsafe work environment. I exercised my Captains authority to provide a safe; hospitable environment for my passengers and crew; by grounding the aircraft. My First Officer and I both returned home from our trips with sewage-laden bags. My bag was subsequently left in the sewage when my First Officer pulled his bag out. The Flight Attendant was required to serve drinks out of a galley adjacent to this lavatory for two flights; thanks to our Maintenance Operation's incompetence. I wrote it up and was in compliance with our MEL procedures. I then followed up to Dispatch and Maintenance Control; only to be met with attitude and told you can't do that. The Company should issue vouchers to the passengers affected on this flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. The Company should offer to replace the First Officer's and Captain's luggage and issue a stipend for belongings damaged.",,,,"B737-700 flight crew reported lavatory leaking into cabin and cockpit area.",

I was flying and working on ATC instructions so Person A; my FO (First Officer); answered the call. He told me that the FAs had encountered a smoking lithium battery pack and had soaked it and it appeared to be no longer smoking. I looked at our position and saw ZZZ2 at my 11 o'clock and 20 miles; ZZZ3 at my 10 o'clock and 50 miles and ZZZ1 at my 12 o'clock and 50 miles. I told him to [request priority handling] and get direct to ZZZ1 and lower. We were given 10;000 ft and a heading of XXX. Passing 14;000 [ft.] I asked Person A to call in the back and check on the smoldering electronic device. The F/A said it had stopped smoking and it had been placed in the over head. We asked that it be put in the 'Fire Containment Bag' and secured for our landing in ZZZ1. 30 miles from ZZZ1 we were given pilots discretion to 2;000 ft. At about 18 miles from we asked for direct ZZZZZ (a fix X.X miles from the airport on the Runway XXL localizer). We called the airport 'insight' and as we were passing 3;000 feet we were told we were leaving class B airspace. We were cleared for the visual approach to Runway XXL. We were expediting our flight to ZZZ1 and slowing to 200 kts at this point was not in the best interest of the safety of flight so we maintained 250 knots until approximately 10 miles from the airport and configured for our flaps full landing. I asked Person A if he would contact rescue 1; after we land; to coordinate with them and how they wanted to take possession of the fire containment bag (at the gate before or after passengers deplaning or before). They said they wanted to come on the aircraft prior to passenger deplaning and take possession of the fire containment bag. I also asked Person A to ask the flight attendants about possible smoke in the cabin after landing. As long as we did not have smoke in the cabin we were going to taxi to the gate. We landed and we did not have smoke in the cabin and rescue 1 would follow us to the gate and collect our fire containment bag. I made an announcement similar to a medical emergency and asked that all passengers remain seated and allow some emergency personnel to enter the aircraft. I would make an announcement when the passengers could deplane. We were escorted to [the] Gate and parked. The firemen collected the fire containment bag and the passengers deplaned without incident.

I got aircraft set up for manual TCL levers and 12K ft. and handed aircraft to FO and stated his aircraft and radios and I would continue with the ECAM Procedures Follow up. We asked ATC to turn us back to ZZZ for a maintenance issue. We went through procedures and finished up the procedures. Also notified FA's [of the] precautionary landing and to prepare for landing; then notified Passengers about a return to ZZZ to have a maintenance issue checked out. I took the controls back and requested priority handling with Center they promptly sent us back to ZZZ Approach and continued with issue; fuel onboard; and SOB's; and we requested ARFF to stand by. I asked FO to set us up for the approach and brief it. I notified Dispatch via ACARS. We then ran through the Precautionary Checklist and the Overweight Landing Checklist. We set up for 27L ILS.

I was pilot flying (PF). As we were approaching our cruise altitude of FL 370 a caution light illuminated which had the Captain and I staring up at the ENG 2 LOW PRESSURE light. The Captain ran the QRH which just directed HYD PUMP switch (affected side) OFF. The B System Pressure remained in the normal range and the hydraulic quantity held at 106%; so we decided to continue to the original destination. Dispatch was notified through ACARS of the situation. 90 minutes later; story time was interrupted by the illumination of ELEC 1 LOW PRESSURE light and I noticed the Hydraulic B quantity dropped rapidly to 0%. The Captain then ran the LOSS OF SYSTEM B QRH. A discussion was had regarding if the situation required a diversion to a longer runway. After being notified; Dispatch ran Stopping Performance numbers; which still resulted in positive numbers; and a now required 30 minutes of brake cool down off the gate. A request for priority handling was made at this point. Twenty minutes after loss of System B; the ENG 1 LOW PRESSURE light illuminated (now the A side is acting up). QRH directed the affected switch be turned off. Realizing that communication via ACARS was hindering our ability to share a mental model with Dispatch and the collection of required data; in a timely manner; I requested a nearby Ops Station to patch our flight through to Dispatch. The Captain conversed with ZZZ while I handled COMM 1. The remaining ELEC 2 pump was providing adequate reduced flow pressure and the A Hydraulic System retained its quantity.Dispatch ran Runway performance numbers for Loss of System A and B; just in case; which still yielded positive stopping performance. After considering the advantages of using the HUD for the approach; the Captain and I switched flying roles (I was now pilot monitoring). We ran the deferred items for the LOSS OF SYSTEM B and received vectors for a long final approach for a flaps 15 landing. A good landing was made; and after the Captain exited the runway; we taxied to a spot to wait out our brake cool down; all the while being monitored by the local Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) who were surrounding the aircraft. While allowing the brakes to cool; several of our Company aircraft reported that fluid was leaking from the underside of Engine 2 (The ARFF Crew was concerned that it may be fuel.).

As we taxied past; we noticed there was a large amount of fluid pooled on the taxiway underneath the right engine. We would come to learn that this aircraft had a loss of Hydraulic System B. The next morning; we reported for our flight at ZZZ1. When we began our preflight duties; Maintenance Personnel came and retrieved the logbook stating there were write ups that needed to be reviewed. We continued boarding the aircraft; got to our scheduled departure time and the logbook had not yet been returned. While we were discussing this; the Captain noticed and brought to my attention that the 'Flap Inhibit' switch was toggled active. We had figured at that point that this aircraft was likely the same aircraft we saw the day prior. Approximately 10 minutes after our scheduled departure time; the logbook was returned; reviewed; and the appropriate checklists completed. We discussed with the Maintenance Personnel that the # 2 engine driven hydraulic pump had been replaced overnight and a ground run had been performed. We departed the gate shortly after this. There were no anomalies on the engine start; taxi; or warmup period. After the takeoff sequence; as the pilot flying (PF); I called for the landing gear to be selected up. While the landing gear retracted; there was a momentary Master Caution light and I saw HYD illuminated on the recall panel. It lasted for less than one second. The hydraulic indications were all normal. During the climbout; we discussed that during the ground run; the landing gear would not have been cycled and that this may have caused the momentary Master Caution/HYD light.We continued the climb and approximately 15-20 minutes into the flight (abeam ZZZ2); the Master Caution light illuminated again with a Low Pressure light illuminated on the ENG 2 HYD Pump. We ran the QRH procedure; which had us place that pump in the OFF position. The quantities and pressures were both still normal at that point. We discussed our options and contacted Dispatch. We felt that continuing to destination was the best course of action. We spent the next 30 minutes or so discussing different scenarios about system failures; reviewing the QRH procedures; etc. I would like to point out that the Captain was very knowledgeable with the systems and it was a great learning experience as I have about 270 hours in type. During this discussion; we noticed that the Hydraulic System A was now indicating 78%. When we departed it was >90%. I wrote down the quantity and time on the ATIS sheet so that we could track the fluid level. Over the next 20 minutes or so; we determined that we had a slow leak of about 2% every eight to nine minutes. I calculated that we would land in ZZZ3 with about 55 to 60% fluid quantity in System A. While we were discussing the now escalating situation; the Hydraulic System B fluid quantity went from 106% to 0% in about 30 seconds. We now had a complete loss of System B with what we believed to be a slow leak in System A. We immediately decided to [request priority handling]; notified Center and requested immediate descent and vectors to ZZZ. We ran the loss of System B QRH procedure; walked through an Approach Brief discussing the nuances of our failed systems and how we would configure. I flew the aircraft and talked to ATC while the Captain coordinated with Dispatch; the Cabin Crew; and ran the QRH.

Therefore; the Captain decided to divert to the nearest suitable airport in the area. Given that we had to land as quickly as possible; we could not waste time (fume onboard) to burn fuel for a landing below max landing weight. Although we were heavy at the time of the fume event; we had to get on the ground safely as quickly as possible.

All pre-flight activities; the ZZZ1-ZZZ2 leg and ZZZ2 turn were normal. Our ZZZ2-ZZZ3 leg was a dry-ice exemption flight and we followed all pre-flight procedures.Approximately 1+00 into the flight; approximately 250 NM East of ZZZ; FL370; my Dragger Alarm activated. After discussing the indications with the First Officer; and the fact that her Dragger remained silent; we considered deploying the 3rd Dragger Monitor from the Overhead Cabinet. Shortly after leaving her seat; the FO (First Officer) reported an odor in the aft cabin/galley area and feeling hypoxia-like symptoms. I also recognized symptoms similar to hypoxia. She returned to her seat and we immediately donned our O2 Masks. I remember feeling extremely lightheaded and dizzy as I donned my mask and we both agreed we had been feeling unrecognized physiological symptoms prior to the Alarm.Once we established communications; the FO and I quickly discussed our Physiological States; the Dragger Alarm and the presence of an odor in the cockpit. We quickly proceeded to the Smoke/Fumes/Fire Elimination checklists in the QRH. As I was already the Pilot Flying; I elected to have the FO remain the PM (Pilot Flying) and run the QRH while I communicated with ATC. We both agreed to coordinate a diversion with ATC. We elected a 180 turn to ZZZ for a straight in approach to Runway XXR. I coordinated an expedited descent; ATC clearing us to minimum step-down altitudes available due to the terrain below us. The FO quickly but methodically worked through the Smoke-Fumes-CO2 QRH checklists; keeping me apprised as she moved through the steps. However; the Dragger Alarm continued despite QRH actions so we elected to focus on preparing for an immediate landing in ZZZ. We continued with our diversion procedures and initially intended to Auto-Land Runway XXR. However the ILS ultimately wasn't available so we elected for a visual approach rather than change runways in close. We also discussed our post landing plan. Not knowing the true nature of our situation (toxic fumes; excessive CO2 or possibly both) we elected to stop straight ahead on the runway and prepare for a possible evacuation.The approach; landing and roll out were expeditious but standard and uneventful. Once setting the parking brake and running the applicable portions of the Evacuation Checklist; we elected to open our windows before removing our masks. That way if there was a toxic fume event/inability to breathe normally we would have the windows available for evacuation. We did not consider the Crew Entrance Door an immediate option as we were unsure of the atmospheric conditions behind us. As soon as we opened our windows the Dragger alarm ceased and we did not smell or note any abnormal fumes or other issues. We felt it more prudent to continue to assess the situation rather than immediately evacuate. We worked with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) for a cabin inspection and egress via normal means. CFR reported high levels of CO2 but no toxic fumes. Once cleared to the crew entrance door and aided by CFR; we exited the aircraft.Post-flight; we were both evaluated on scene and then ultimately elected to go to a local area hospital. Diagnostic tests did not indicate any exposure to toxic substances or other lasting physiological effects. However; after describing the event/physiological symptoms to the on-call physician; she believed that we were likely exposed to a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide. Unfortunately there was no medical test available with which to confirm her diagnoses.",,,,"Air carrier First Officer reported a fume event during cruise was identified by the CO2 alarm activating.

During this time the passenger was being attended by a physician on board. The passengers situation was improving but then quickly deteriorated. At this time; the physician on board communicates that we need to divert; and quickly. The Captain informed Operations Control and Dispatch and the mutual decision to divert is made.

The shimmy progressively got worse and a few seconds prior to rotation we heard a single knock. We lifted off normally and retracted the landing gear. The retraction was slightly louder and the spin down of the nose wheel was longer than normal. Eventually the noise ceased when the wheel rotation stopped. The climb and cruise was normal. About halfway through our flight to ZZZ1; we were told by ZZZ Center that the Tower in ZZZ reported they found tire debris on the runway after our departure. We discussed the situation with each other and based on the events from take-off we felt we probably had damage to the tire. We discussed our options and reviewed our manual; which had guidance for failed tire on take-off and landing with a flat tire. We both agreed our safest option was to divert to ZZZ2.It provided us with a longer runway option as well as maintenance and operations availability. We notified ATC and [requested priority handling] with a diversion to ZZZ2. We then notified Dispatch; the Flight Attendants; and passengers. We reviewed the landing procedures in the manual and briefed the landing. The landing was normal and we were able to maintain directional control. We stopped on the runway and vehicles approached to inspect the damage. They said the left nose wheel was missing the outer tread but was still inflated. The right nose wheel had no damage.

She also informed us that another Flight Attendant was smelling and feeling the same thing. The Captain asked if they could swap places with the aft Flight Attendants to confirm what was happening. They did and confirmed what FA said. After a brief discussion it was best to divert back to ZZZ due to having better medical care; longer runways for an overweight landing; and better services for the passengers. We began the process of coordinating with ATC for a clearance and [requested priority handling] due to having incapacitated crew members. The QRC and QRH procedures were completed and we also descended to 10;000 ft. in case we would need to turn off both packs. Not long after we began the return; we were informed that the FA was being administered oxygen. Only the right pack was turned off. After a few minutes; the FA reported feeling better; but then later the symptoms returned and oxygen was administered again. We prepared for our arrival in to ZZZ. Things were uneventful other that a little more communication regarding the [event] and Operations.Once at the gate; emergency personnel boarded the aircraft and assessed the FA. They took her in to the terminal and then we began deplaning the passengers. Maintenance logs were filled out. Phone calls were made to the union; the Duty Officer; crew scheduling; and others. We decided to all be checked medically. All the Flight Attendants were transported by ambulance. The Captain drove me to the hospital where I was checked. Afterwards; I talked with scheduling about a hotel and what would happen next. I went to the hotel and got to my room around XA:00am.I did not recognize the event as one that required the use of a QRC or QRH procedure. It was only after we began to divert back to ZZZ that the Captain began to do the QRC. This delay possibly led to increased exposure to the fumes; but reduced the total time of the incident.In an incident like this; I think it would be most appropriate to isolate the crew from passengers. This would allow assessment to be completed more timely; and reduce the possibility of social media exposure. It would also allow crew members to make all the phone calls necessary to report the incident. The number of phone calls required to be made by the Captain was enormous. Having one incident response phone call would considerably reduce the stress of the situation and allow a more timely medical assessment of crew members. There was only one person performing assessments; and when the passengers saw that crew members were being assessed and wheeled out on gurneys; they became more agitated about what they could have been exposed to and requested assessment. I did my best to alleviate the work load of the Captain; but there was only so much I could do.Also; it can be daunting for a person to be in an unfamiliar city while experiencing a situation like this. It would be best to keep crew members together as best as possible; at least in the same hospital.One of the biggest recommendations I can make is to get rid of an outside contractor in coordinating medical care in emergency cases. The process was difficult; unnecessary; and extremely frustrating. I had people calling me during required rest times. I found out after I got home that they had not considered me cleared to travel until the case was closed (after I had deadheaded to ZZZ1; stayed the night; deadheaded to ZZZ2; and commuted home). Outside contractors are not familiar with our operation and did not work in my best interest.",,"We received a call from forward Flight Attendants alerting us to a 'smelly socks' odor in the forward portion of the passenger cabin and saying that both were light headed. I asked that the aft Flight Attendants give a report on their condition as well as other passengers in the forward cabin. Aft attendants confirmed the smell forward but were unaffected while aft. Passengers forward also noted the smell and lightheadedness. Neither Captain nor FO (First Officer) noted any fumes or symptoms. We shortly received word that the 'A' Flight Attendant had to sit and go on oxygen. At this point; I determined that due to crew incapacitation we would need to return to a suitable field without any undue delay. We received clearance to proceed direct ZZZ from ATC. We [were given priority handling] and squawked XXXX. I chose ZZZ for the longer runway because we were 8000 lbs. above MLW and the more robust medical facilities there. We received clearance to descend to 10;000 ft. I did this to burn fuel off but primarily to ensure that if the fumes condition worsened we could depressurize the aircraft immediately. radar contact with Center. Right pack off per QRH smoke and fumes procedure. FAs (Flight Attendants) reported smell had abated and air was fresher. Landed ZZZI was distracted with safely diverting the aircraft in [the] airspace. It took about 20 minutes after the initial report and ten minutes after [we advised ATC] to start on the QRH procedure. The Aviate; Navigate; Communicate; Checklist guideline kept us from getting the right pack off in a timely manner. Immediate and timely execution of the smoke and fumes QRH procedure may have lessened to exposure to fumes experienced by those in the passenger cabin.Determining the severity of the situation was difficult. Ultimately; we made the decision to trust the concerns of our cabin crew despite not having any corroborating evidence. At the time of this writing; I still don't know whether Maintenance has determined a source of the fumes. The deciding factor was hearing that the 'A' had gone on O2 and had to sit. At that point; a crew member was incapacitated and we [had advised ATC].The decision to turn and descend in ETOPS airspace had to be weighed against the advantage of an immediate return and descent vs. positive deconfliction with other ETOPS aircraft. We opted to wait for clearance because we felt the situation in the cabin didn't warrant immediate turn and descent without ATC clearance.Advocate for the crew once blocked in. It was difficult to keep up with the myriad of calls; reports etc. after we reached the gate while simultaneously ensuring the crew were properly cared for. Medical support was great but it would be nice to have one crew member make all the arrangements for everyone so we could concentrate on other tasks.

Condition were IFR with light to moderate Rain and visibility of 2/1/2 mile at the surface. Pilot flying (PF) was First Officer (FO); and I was the pilot monitoring (PM). We were given a descent clearance to be followed by a base turn to final. While descending on the downwind; FO stated that the aircraft was making an uncommanded turn. With his hands on the control the Autopilot disengaged. FO struggle to regain control indicating strong control force and a pitch down trim force. Concern was a possible runaway trim. I immediately deployed the trim wheel handle and began to trim airplane aft according to FO instruction. My only concern at the time was flying the airplane and regaining control. The only indication I remember up to this point was the red Autopilot annunciator illuminated. ATC called several time to issue turn instruction. We did not respond; due to the urgency of aircraft control. After regaining control; there were concerns about the trim as express by the FO. I decided to eliminate confusion and cutoff the stab trim switches. I informed the FO that switches were cutoff and that we were now manual trim. I then responded to ATC and [requested priority handling]. ATC acknowledged the request and requested the standard passenger count and fuel onboard. I want to land ASAP; now that we had control under what seemed to be manual reversion. The FO was doing a great job turn and descending. We were able to turn and descent to 4;000 ft. and establish ourselves on final. There was much dialog and sense of urgency in our communication in the flight deck. I wanted to land immediately; since time was a factor and weather was not in our favor. As we started to configure with flaps; we attempted to extend the gear. The gear did not extend. At this point it became an approach to landing would not be feasible. I requested a straight out miss and maintaining 4;000 ft. ATC granted that request and shortly thereafter gave us a climb to 8;000 ft. and a turn to the east. At this point; we got busy in a hurry. FO wanted to clean up the flaps. This made sense as first and then I reconsidered. Valuable time was being wasted trying to climb and configure; I also did not see any advantage to clean up with a hydraulic issue. I did not want to lose the use of flaps and then complicate issue more. This was discussed between the FO and I. We agreed not to clean up completely. We left the flaps a 1; the indicator stop a 5. I instructed ATC that we were going to stop the climb at 5;000 ft. They gave us clearance to maintain 5;000 ft. This helped us focus on the gear problem. At this point; I also decided to bring the jump seat pilot into helping us. I instructed him to plug in a headset. Up to this point; everything was just happening too fast and I needed to slow things down and get the gear down. I opened the QRH and started the Manual gear extension checklist. I had the Jump Seat Pilot extend the gear since he had great access to these handles. Right gear was dropped first; this caused a yaw to the right and a pitch down attitude. More manual trim required. Then nose and left gear. This stabilized the yaw. At this point; I was ready to come back for the approach and advised ATC. They started to give us headings back to ILS XXC. I ask the FO is he was OK; or needed a break. He informed me that he was good to continue pilot flying. I then instructed the Jump Seater to monitor FO and keep him focus and talk to him and the same time; I instructed FO to keep the turns to no more than 10 degrees. I advised ATC; that we need a shallow intercept to final. I notice that HYD B system was at 60 percent and brake pressure just above 2;500 PSI. I coordinated with the FO and we agreed that he would only fly the plane. I had the Thrust Levers and the trim. We settled on a speed of 170 kts. for approach. Again; Flap handle was at 1 while indicator was at 5. We broke out at 400 ft. AGL with runway in sight and light showers. Once landing was assured; I set the power to idle. FO needed back trim to arrest the sink rate. I trim back aggressively. We landed and max brake was applied. Control was exchanged and I was able to turn off slowly clearing the runway. We were towed to our gate.Time; Weather and operating in a terminal area under IFR condition with no Autopilot.",,,,"B737-800 Captain reported loss of autopilot and hydraulic system failure caused controllability issues in flight.

He also smelled it. We then noticed that it smelled like dirty socks. The Captain directed me to send a message to Dispatch so they could plan for Maintenance due to a fume event while he checked with the Flight Attendants. The A Flight Attendant also smelled the odor. We continued the descent and the smell grew stronger. I stated that my head was hurting and I felt nauseated. The Captain also was noticing weird symptoms so he called for us to don the oxygen masks and run the procedure for smoke/fire/fumes. While I was accomplishing the checklist; the Captain flew the airplane and handled radio communications and [requested priority handling to destination]. We flew the RNAV approach due to a NOTAM for the ILS and IMC. Upon landing; we taxied to the gate and shutdown the engines and opened the windows before removing the oxygen masks. We got the passengers off quickly. The A Flight Attendant admitted that she threw up and had a sore throat. I also felt unwell. While walking to the hotel van; all 3 Flight Attendants said they felt odd and dizzy with headaches. I also had the same symptoms. We all discussed going to the ER but the Pilots and Flight Attendants were scheduled for 2 different hotels. I exchanged numbers with them and told them to call if they continued to worsen or needed medical care. After getting to the hotel; I continued to feel dizzy; have a headache; and felt like my coordination and concentration was taking more energy than usual. I went to the nearest ER within 1 hour of the event. The Flight Attendant text me and said she vomited 2 times and felt very sick but that she and the other flight attendants were not going to the ER because they 'can't afford the sick points; and our union said we'd get penalized and have to fight to remove the points.' I received blood work; fluids; and O2 for 4.5 hours at the ER. I removed myself from the trip and still felt unwell for 48 hours. The A Flight Attendant worked the next day but sought medical attention after her trip ended due to lingering effects.Find and fix the issues causing fume events and don't allow employees to be penalized or fear reprisal for seeking medical assistance/ being pressured to fly unwell.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported a dirty socks odor during descend.

The flight started normally and we were not rushed for time as our previous flight from ZZZ2 arrived on time. After we had pushed and started a southeast taxi; we noticed that the autothrottles somehow became disconnected. We reengaged the AT (Autothrottles) only to have them come off once again after about 10 seconds. At this point we had left the ramp and were taxiing south on [Taxiway] XX. We started the number one engine and after the number one engine was started and stabilized; the AT stayed on and we had no further issues with it. We did have a contingency brief on what our plan was should it disconnect on our takeoff roll; but it stayed on for the remainder of our flight till my FO (First Officer) disconnected them for landing. My FO was the pilot flying and after a normal takeoff from Runway XX; I was finishing up our after takeoff checklist when I started to smell a burning smell of some sort in the flight deck while climbing through approximately 1;000 ft. AGL. I confirmed this with my First Officer; who said he smelt the same burning smell; during our debrief he would later tell me he also had slight irritation in his eyes around the time we noticed the fumes. We performed our memory items for smoke and fumes followed by running the QRC items for smoke and fumes. My First Officer was the flying pilot so I handed ATC comms to my FO while I checked in with our flight attendants. I advised them of the situation and asked if they had anything in the galley ovens that might be burning. We were told that there was no food cooking in the galley oven but they would check for any residual food. My FO and I had a brief short discussion about the AT disconnecting a few times while taxiing out southeast and wondered if it might be related to that. The AT continued to work fine so I then continued on with the checklist for smoke and fumes and directed our FAs (Flight Attendant) to turn on and off various cabin lights per the checklist. After confirming no remaining food in the ovens that could be burning; our aft FAs did confirm a burning smell of some sort; while our forward galley FAs confirmed no strong smell but they did smell something on takeoff but thought it was fumes from prior departing aircraft. Since the burning smell was still present and we could not identify where the fumes were originating from; we decided to return to ZZZ.My FO continued to handle the PF (Pilot Flying) duties as well as ATC comms; while I sent a quick message to Dispatch and ran through the briefing with our Lead Flight Attendant. Afterwards; I continued further in the checklist as far as I could; both packs off below 10;000 ft. at this point in the smoke and fumes removal checklist; until I decided that time was of the essence and I could not continue any further as we were being vectored back for Runway XXC; the runway we requested as we had just landed on it a few hours prior. After loading the FMC for a return to field; responding to Dispatch via ACARS; and a quick brief for [Runway] XXC; I then made an announcement to our passengers about the issue and our return to ZZZ. We finished our descent checklist to make sure we didn't miss any items and after discussing the overweight landing situation; I decided it was best to allow my FO to continue flying as he felt comfortable with the situation and we made an uneventful landing in ZZZ. We were overweight but I don't exactly recall the number other than it was by about 4000 lb. We cleared [Runway] XXC and talked to Airport Rescue and Firefighting who verified there was no visible smoke and fumes before taxiing back to our gate uneventfully.",,"I was the PF (Pilot Flying) on this leg. We elected to taxi out single engine and the autothrottles disengaged several times with only one engine running. After the second engine start; there were no more issues with this system. We briefed a contingency plan for the takeoff roll that we would continue if they disengaged.After departure; while retracting flaps; we both noticed fumes/a burning odor in the flight deck. We performed the smoke/fire/fumes QRC procedure; and then I took over the radios while the Captain called the flight attendants. We elected to continue climbing and stay on course for the time being. The flight attendants confirmed the burning smell and stated there was no burning food in the ovens. They double-checked this prior to diverting.We were unable to identify the source of the fumes and the Captain continued running the QRH procedure while I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Departure. We were cleared direct to the field. I set up for an overweight landing on Runway XXC. We notified the flight attendants; passengers; Dispatch and ATC. A normal overweight landing was completed.

At this point; it was obvious that we would not be able to climb above 10;000 ft. due to our unpressurized state. Continuing to ZZZZ was no longer viable. At this point; I assumed the radios and asked ATC for a return to ZZZ.Inflight crewmembers stated that the fumes had subsided at this point; but they were experiencing symptoms such as dizziness; burning eyes; chest pain; and labored breathing. Each inflight crewmember seemed to have different symptoms. I asked if they wanted medical attention; to which they declined. As we got closer to ZZZ; I told the First Officer that I would rather request help and not need it rather than the other way around. While the First Officer was managing the aircraft and radios; I notified Dispatch; ran the divert QRH; the Over-Weight Landing QRH; helped reprogram the FMS; etc. A normal approach and soft landing was made. All overweight considerations were made and the emergency vehicles followed us to the gate. No assistance was needed. Upon arrival; a normal deplaning was conducted.

AFL we received an ECAM caution message ANTI ICE CAPT L STAT and ANTI ICE CAPT R STAT. First Officer (FO) was pilot flying (PF). After aircraft was in clean configuration; I assigned FO the aircraft and radios while I ran QRC; ECAM; QRH; and follow up actions. I selected AIR DATA SWITCH to CAPT 3 per ECAM. The Captain; FO; and STBY airspeed and altitude indications appeared accurate. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and explained the circumstances. Maintenance Control ran a real-time diagnostic query on the system and advised me that the aircraft was reporting a faulty PROBE HEAT COMPUTER #1. During our discussion regarding continuation of the flight to ZZZ1; the Captain and FO altimeters started to diverge. When the difference reached 300 ft. between Captain and FO altimeters; I directed the FO to advise ATC we were not RVSM capable. At this point the Captain altimeter read 30;300 ft.; the STBY altimeter read 29;700 ft.; and the FO altimeter read 30;000 ft. I was still connected on communications and advised Maintenance Control of our diverging altimeter discrepancy. Maintenance Control performed another query and advised us the aircraft was reporting a failure of both CAPT STATIC PORTS; and then recommended we return to ZZZ; and Dispatch and I agreed. We considered the FO instruments to be the most reliable and relied primarily on them. I coordinated our return to ZZZ; reviewed the QRH NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS; briefed Flight Attendants (FA's) and passengers; and ran the QRH procedure for OVERWEIGHT LANDING. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and the FO made a perfectly soft landing. We exited the runway and ZZZ COMMAND checked the aircraft then advised us everything appeared normal; then followed us to the gate. Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entries were made for the mechanical discrepancy and overweight landing.",,"Shortly after thrust reduction on our initial climb off of Runway XXL at ZZZ; we received a Master Caution for CAPT 1 and 2 STATIC PORT ANTI ICE INOP. I maintained aircraft control while the Captain worked the ECAM action and follow up QRH procedures. I continued flying the SID while the Captain contacted Maintenance Control and Dispatch. As we were approaching FL300; I noticed a disparity between the Captain's and First Officer's (FO's) altimeters of greater than 200 ft. Upon reaching FL300; the Captain and I agreed we needed to descend out of RVSM airspace. Maintenance Control; Dispatch; the Captain and I all agreed we needed to return to ZZZ. I informed ATC of our altimeter error; the need to descend out of RVSM airspace and the need to return to ZZZ. While on recovery to ZZZ; we discovered that we would be landing over weight and [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Approach. We ran all applicable checklist and informed the flight attendants and passengers of our situation. I flew the recovery via the ZZZZZ2 arrival to the ILS XXR and landed in accordance with our overweight landing checklist. Fire and rescue met us after we taxied clear; informed us that our brake temperatures were acceptable and followed us to the gate.It appeared that a computer failure of the Captain's 1 and 2 static port anti ice failed after passing 1;500 ft.

The APU was on MEL and on the inbound flight Gen 2 had failed. I talked with maintenance and the plan was to fix both. They were working on the APU and waiting on a part for Gen 2. Because Gen 2 would require an engine run; we held off boarding until this was complete. Maintenance finished their work and we started boarding. The APU was cleared but Gen 2 was still inop. We obtained Version 2 of the release with MEL 24-XX-XXX. Our altitude was lowered to FL330 per the MEL. MEL A22-XX-XX was also applied. I chose to run the APU during the entire preflight and boarding to make sure that it was good. I also added 1000 lbs. of gas to offset the APU burn on our 4+36 minute flight. We departed at XA38z or XB38 pacific. 38 minutes late. Taxi out and take-off were uneventful. We had a significant number of live TVs out perhaps it would be better to turn the TV system off when working on the aircraft electrical system. Passing FL320 our APU shutdown! We descended back to FL310 and attempted a relight. The APU restarted Hooray! And then auto shutdown about 10 seconds later. We were now single generator with no chance to get a second one online. I made the decision to return to ZZZ. We were only 30 minutes out and it had a long sea level runway with good weather. I notified the Flight Attendants with using the emergency call. I had started with all call but when only 2 answered I used emergency call. I wanted the entire crew on the call. The Flight Attendant 1 asked if it was urgent; and I said yes. We informed ATC that we needed to return to ZZZ. They asked if we wanted to request priority handling and I said yes do to the overweight landing. We were around 180000 lbs at that time we landed around 176000 lbs. I notified Dispatch via ACARS and he notified the ZZZ station. We completed the aircraft monitor and QRH. We also ran the overweight landing checklist. We landed at ZZZ at XC00 local XD00Z. We shot the ILS XXL. I intercepted the glide slope early and followed it down. I also configured early. While the overweight checklist mentioned turning the auto thrust off and slowing to get below the flap speed; this wasn't required at our weight. I used auto brakes low and max reverse.

[Priority handling was requested] and a return to ZZZZ was requested with ATC. The NON-NORMAL LANDING checklist was run followed by the OVERWEIGHT LANDING checklist. The landing app was used to derive landing distance; runway XX provided more than sufficient distance on the runway at our weight. All normal checklists were completed.Operation was conducted in VFR conditions. ILS XX was set up in the navigation and briefed to provide glide path and a more stable approach and touchdown.Approach; transition were normal; rate of descent at touchdown was minimal; very soft and we rolled the aircraft the full length of the runway. We requested ATC to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) meet us at the end of Runway XX to inspect the brakes; ATC requested that we turn off the runway onto taxiway hotel. No ARFF came. We asked again and were provided a standard taxi instruction. We explained out need and asked again for ARFF. We were requested to taxi up X to Y taxiway before ARFF would check our aircraft. With brakes still in white we attempted the taxi without using brakes. Turning onto Taxiway Y BRAKE TEMP EICAS message displayed. ARFF then came out to evaluate. At that point brakes brakes 7;8;10 and 11 had just come into cautionary range. Approximately 25 minutes after landing. We stopped the aircraft on Y without using the parking brake. ARFF checked the brakes and said brakes and tires looked good and we could continue our taxi to the gate. Taxi Brake Cooling Chart at our weight showed 30 more minutes of cooling was needed to be considered safe. Shortly after; the number 7 Tire lost pressure. Thankfully ARFF had stayed with us as we sat through the cooling window. We found a huge disconnect communicating with the Tower and the relay of information from the ARFF team. For 98% of the operational needs of the airport; ZZZZ Tower does a great job. When situations like this take place; the ability to relay nuanced information between the fire trucks and the cockpit was a struggle. There were a few very key moments that were left with dead air or need to ask for clarification of the status of the situation. As we approached our brake cooling time; the temperature of the brakes was back in the normal range. Our mechanics showed up on Taxiway Y with a tug and headset. After they assessed the aircraft to be safe; ARFF accompanied us to the gate without further incident.In reviewing aircraft log and history of right engine fire loop 1 issues before departure; crew discussed possible scenarios to be warry of on our route especially the MOCA on our route crossing into the country. ZZZZ ATC has a very difficult time understanding requests past basic communication. We discussed this as part of our threat forward briefing. Unlike some airports; there is no way for pilots to talk directly to the firefighters checking the airplane other than hand signals. At ZZZZ; the only way to communicate with the firefighters is through the Tower Controller. Depth of English can sometimes be unpredictable. Controllers switch between English and Spanish and their accent is very unusual. May be a very good idea to update the company pages that there needs to be extra clear and concise communication. Any delay or wavering in response should be rephrased to ensure that the message is understood between both parties.",,"ANTI ICE LEAK ENG R EICAS.

During rollout; aircraft vibrated significantly and pulled right; but was controllable; remaining on the center line. After the aircraft had slowed below 50 kts; very light braking was applied and aircraft was brought to a complete stop. Flaps were left at 40 to prevent any possible further damage if a blown tire had occurred. After landing; Flight Attendants called and reported that oxygen masks in row XX had deployed. ZZZ fire arrived immediately and informed us that the number three main tire was blown. Brake temperatures were negligible. We were also informed hydraulic fluid was leaking from the right main landing gear. Aircraft was shut down using normal procedures. Coordinated with Operations and initial plan was to tow aircraft back to gate with passengers on board. Maintenance arrived; and informed us that they would need to change the tire; at which point; I determined the best course of action was to have the passengers; deplane via air-stairs and take buses back to the terminal. Upon the arrival of the air-stairs; deplaning the passengers was uneventful. Throughout this situation; the performance of my crew was exemplary. Passengers were kept fully informed of the actions we were taking; but also apprised of the potential risks. Due to our early departure out of ZZZ (time); after landing; coordination with all the Ground personnel took quite a bit of time; but passengers were kept fully informed at every step of the process. Other actions taken: Requested runway inspections for both Runways YYL and XX. Coordinated for hydraulic cleanup on Runway XX. Given the initial indications; I would not change how I handled this situation. If we had suspected a blown tire; would not have raised the landing gear.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"B737-700 Flight Crew reported anti skid failure on take-off caused a blown main wheel tire.

The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF). While climbing thru FL340 with the Autopilot and autothrottle engaged; we experienced a significant loss of electrical power. The autopilot and autothrottle disconnected; Master Caution illuminated with ELEC on my six pack along with numerous amber warning lights. We also lost most background lighting at this time. I stated 'your aircraft;' canceled the Master Caution; the FO stated 'my aircraft;' and took manual control of the aircraft. I contacted ATC to request a level off at FL350 and stated that we had a problem we needed to work on. My initial thought was that we had just lost a generator; but that it would be a quick fix. After focusing my attention on the overhead panel and seeing the many amber lights along with the loss of background lighting; I realized it was more serious. I positioned the APU switch to start and told ATC that we would need to return to ZZZ. I'm not one hundred percent positive that I [requested priority handling] with ATC at that point. I know I had hit the mic switch to talk to ATC with the intent to [request priority handling] when I heard the FO say 'I have nothing on my side.' I diverted my attention to the FO's side and could see that he had no flight instruments and was hand flying while looking cross cockpit at my displays. I will add at this point that for some reason; my audio panel kept switching from VHF1 to FLT on its own making communication with ATC more difficult. At this time I felt that it was better for me to fly and have the FO assume the role of pilot monitoring (PM). The FO suggested we descend; being concerned that the APU may not start and we may ultimately have a problem with the pressurization system. I wasn't too concerned that the APU would not start as we had not been airborne for long enough for it to be cold soaked; but I was concerned about overall fuel pressure to the engines as we had numerous fuel pump low pressure lights illuminated. I agreed and he began to coordinate for a lower altitude with ATC as I took the aircraft and directed him to check the QRC and open the QRH for the proper electrical checklist. After taking control of the aircraft; I found that I could not actuate the elevator trim using the switches on my yoke and asked the FO if his worked. He tried his and stated that his did not work either. We were both a bit unsure which checklist was appropriate as the Bus Switching (electrical) panel looked normal initially; and no lights were illuminated on the Generator Drive and Standby Power panel. However; from all appearances; we had suffered a major loss of AC power and were operating on standby power. We both agreed that; even though no Transfer Bus Off lights or Source Off lights were illuminated; the most appropriate checklist to start with was the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist. The APU started normally and indicated that the APU generator was available. After completing the initial steps of the checklist with no restoration of power; I had the FO hold the checklist and contact the flight attendants to let them know we were working an electrical problem; that we were returning to ZZZ; and to find out if they had enough lighting in the back and ask if everyone was okay. After taking control of the radios so the FO could run the checklists; I continued to coordinate with ATC for lower altitude; giving the requested info; and requesting Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) equipment meet us at ZZZ. Once level at 16;000 ft. and approximately 45 miles from ZZZ; I requested delay vectors for time to work the problem and had the FO take control of the aircraft. Just as I was relinquishing control; I felt the trim wheel move slightly. I thought the FO may had begun to trim; so I did not say anything. The FO then observed the same thing. My thought was that maybe the Speed Trim system was doing that; but unsure how it could have done that given the failure of AC power that we had. I knew that neither one of us had done it and that neither one of us had use of electric trim; so I elected to move both stab trim cutout switches to cutout; and remove it completely from the equation. I informed the Flight Attendants that we were still working our electrical problem and informed the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZ. I then elected to review the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist and determined we had both arrived at the same conclusion. Since it appeared as though we were on Standby Power; or some state in between; I decided to review the Additional Information at the end to the checklist; regarding the 'unlikely event that a landing must be made on standby power.' I'm glad I did that; as it would come into play later. At this point; I went thru the overhead panel to review all of the various indications we were presented with. The Window Heat panel indicated overheat on two of the windows; as expected with a loss of power. The Low Pressure light for Electric Pump 2 was illuminated on the Hydraulic panel. The pneumatic duct pressure needles were both pointing at the (approximately) 12 o'clock position; very unusually high. We were also noticing that the temperature in the aircraft was getting very warm. The FO attempted to adjust the temperature using the temperature control knobs; but that seemed to have no effect. I directed him to turn all three temp control knobs to the off position in hopes that the packs would regulate to 75 and 65 degrees respectively. That had no effect so I later directed him to turn the trim air switch off and leave it at that. We had no Pack or Zone Temp lights illuminated. We checked the pressurization system and it seemed to be functioning properly the entire time with no lights illuminated. We had fuel in the center tank; so all six fuel pump switches were in the on position; but at this point; four of the six had low pressure lights illuminated. The only ones providing pressure were the left center and forward pump in the left wing. The FO then brought to my attention that we were beginning to get out of balance on the fuel. I reconfigured the fuel panel to correct for that and continued to evaluate the problem. The AC and DC Metering panel had only the BAT DISCHARGE light illuminated. The TR UNIT light was not illuminated. I was confident that the BAT DISCHARGE light was due mostly to the APU start. The panel indicated -5 amps and 25 volts for the battery at this point. Gen 2 showed no frequency and no volts; but the GEN OFF BUS light for number 2 was not illuminated. Gen1 indicated good frequency and volts; but did not appear to pick up the load with the initial step of the checklist and the GEN OFF BUS light remained illuminated. At this point; we had the APU generator connected to Bus 1. It appeared to me that the majority (but not all) of the problem may have been with Transfer Bus 2. I did a quick review of the Transfer Bus Off checklist in hopes that it may be of some help; but ultimately we were stuck with what we had. I then decided to take control of the aircraft and directed the FO to sit back and methodically look thru all of our indications and verify that we were not overlooking anything.While the FO was performing that task; I communicated our request for the ILS XXC at ZZZ. We had just departed ZZZ and we knew that ZZZ was VFR. With the BAT DISCHARGE light illuminated; and the significant power loss we had experienced; I did not want to delay any further; so we informed ATC that we were ready to continue to ZZZ. I then transferred control of the aircraft and radios to the FO and requested that; with the next ATC controller; he confirm that they were aware we were a [priority] aircraft and we wanted the ARFF equipment to meet us. I accomplished the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist; coordinated with the Flight Attendants; and advised the passengers that we would be landing shortly and that they would see airport safety vehicles around the aircraft after we had stopped on the runway. I then took control of the aircraft and the FO resumed the duties of PM. As we were approaching ZZZ we were advised that the ILS was out of service on XXC and were asked if we would like XXL. Given our current circumstances; I wanted the longest runway available. The FO then asked for XXR and was told that the ILS XXR was out of service as well. Apparently the FAA was performing some flight checks of the equipment that night. I asked the FO to request the RNAV XXC; mostly just for initial lateral and vertical guidance; as we wanted a long final due to the hand flying and manual trim necessary for the approach. We discussed threats; I briefed the approach; and accomplished all normal checklists. Before beginning the approach; I reviewed with the FO what was in the Additional Information on the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist and that; in particular; the flap position indicator may be inoperative for us. We also discussed that the Speed Brake Do Not Arm light was illuminated; so I would not arm the speed brakes for landing and that I would need to manually deploy them on landing. I began to slow the aircraft and configure for landing on Runway XXC. The FO pointed out that we had proper indications on the leading edge devices; but no indication on the flap gauge for the trailing edge flaps. I let him know that with each flap selection; I could feel the pitch change anticipated with normal flap movement and there was no rolling tendency. Everything felt as though it was operating normally. Due to time constraints; I had decided not to run the Stab Inoperative Checklist; but I am aware that the Stab Trim Inoperative checklist states to plan a flaps 15 landing. Given that the weather and visibility at ZZZ was very good; unsure of anti-skid operation; and in consideration of everything else that was going on; I wanted the approach to be as normal as possible and elected to land with flaps 30. I was comfortable hand flying and the manual trim inputs required were very manageable. Much more so than in the sim. I informed the FO that if we needed to go-around for any reason; I anticipated not using full go-around power and that we would do things at a slower pace to account for the manual trim required. We landed safely on XXC and brought the aircraft to a stop. I retracted the speed brakes and directed the FO to move the flaps to 40. The FO communicated with ARFF while I quickly made a PA to the passengers and spoke briefly with the Flight Attendants. As we were waiting for ARFF to inspect the aircraft; I noticed that we had a TR UNIT and ELEC light illuminated now that we were on the ground. We got the 'all clear' from ARFF and had them follow us as we taxied back to the terminal.Cause: Electrical system malfunction.Suggestions: The electrical non-normals should have some notes regarding fuel balance. I know that is part of normal flying duties; but it is often difficult to analyze various electrical problems; and with everything going on; that can easily fall out of your crosscheck and be missed until the fuel is out of balance.","Reporter stated the root cause was not determined; but the issue was resolved by ground maintenance replacement of both generator control units and main bus tie breaker. Reporter commented that the checklists are not well designed to deal with this kind of electrical issue and the flight crew was unsure of the exact nature of the failure.","The incident occurred on Day; around XA30. I was the pilot flying (PF); and the Captain was the pilot monitoring (PM). We were climbing through flight level 340 when we heard a loud clunk with the loss of all electrical power. The power quickly came back quickly but my side of the aircraft was very degraded in the instrumentation I had. The Captain requested a level off at flight level 350 and I began to fly and level off the aircraft using the Integrated Standby Instrument System as I had a Primary Flight Display (PFD) and a Multifunction Flight Display (MFD) but no instrumentation or navigation on them. They appeared to look like they were stuck in the aircraft startup mode. The Captain immediately started the APU and reported to ATC we had an issue. Once we realized the aircraft was not going to recover itself through the backup systems; he [requested priority handling] and he took control of the aircraft as it was easier for him to fly then me at this time. The systems that I had on my side of the aircraft seemed to be hit or miss in what worked as I had a com 2 panel; but no nav 2 panel. We lost the transponder and altitude reporting system. Auto Pressurization seemed to be working as it was supposed too but a lot of warning and caution lights that were supposed to be working did not. In my limited experience with the airplane; it was very confusing in what exactly was happening to the electrical system.The Captain told me to reference the QRC and then the QRH. I asked him if he thought the dual loss of generator's was appropriate. He responded with it was and I began to run through the procedure. As I was running through the procedure; he requested a return to ZZZ and a lower altitude as I brought to his attention the APU may not start and if we lost the auto pressurization system it would be easier to control at a lower altitude. I worked through the procedure; and it did nothing to fix or alleviate the problem. I then glanced over the loss of a single engine driven generator and that procedure was almost a duplicate to the loss of all generator's procedure. The APU would not connect or at least showed no indication of connecting to the right side of the aircraft. We leveled off at 16;000 ft. and I told the Captain that none of the procedures were working and that I was comfortable flying the aircraft if he wanted to look over everything and see if I had missed something. He agreed and I took over the flight controls and radios so he could do the checklists without being distracted. We had ZZZ Center give us vectors around as it was easier than trying to get the aircraft into a defined holding pattern. The Captain ran through the procedures and got the same results as I did. We then evaluated what we had and decided the best place to land was ZZZ since the weather was VFR there. The Captain then took back over the flying duties and comms and had me look over the entire cockpit to see if either of us missed anything. Every switch and button was in its desired place per the checklist and normal operating procedures. There were no visible circuit breakers popped or any true indication of something out of place. After that I took over the radios and began to get ready to land at ZZZ. We requested ILS XXC but found out the ILS was decommissioned on that runway and XXR. We did not want to land on XXL as it was the shortest runway; and we did not know for sure what systems were actually going to operate normally. We then requested RNAV Z XXC and setup for that approach. The Captain flew the approach to landing perfectly and we stopped on the runway to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) check the airplane over. They found nothing visible and followed us to the gate. Cause: The aircraft is one of the oldest in the fleet.",,"B737-800 Flight Crew reported while climbing thru FL340 with the autopilot and autothrottle engaged; they experienced a significant loss of electrical power.

Initial takeoff normal. Airspeed alive call made. During takeoff roll we had an ECAM pop up. I believe this happened before 80 knots. I am unsure if I made the 80 knots power set call. Captain advanced thrust levers to TOGA. No continuing call made; but I understood the intention to go at TOGA. Engine 2 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) mode fault along with Engine 2 system fault at the bottom of the ECAM page. To be clear this is what the ECAM read after the Rejected Takeoff (RTO) as we had a chance to read it after stopping. Everything else seemed normal with the aircraft at this point. At this point an RTO thought popped into my mind. Being go minded this seemed like a reasonable response as the aircraft did not feel as if it was unable to fly. As we accelerated we heard a Bang. The Captain called reject and at this point the takeoff was rejected. This was during high speed regime. Unsure as to actual speed. No call made as I was distracted by the bang and ECAM. I advised tower that we were rejecting the takeoff and we taxied clear of the runway to a stop. Reading through the ECAM; we shut down Engine 2 and started the APU. A call to remain seated was made. I talked to the in-flight crew to see if they smelled or saw anything of concern. One crew member mentioned the smell of burnt rubber which I figured was somewhat normal as we had indeed heated up the brakes. After coordinating with company and ATC we proceeded back to the gate. We also; at this time made a PA to the cabin advising that we were returning to the gate. The aircraft taxied without any tactile indication that the tire was flat. Didn't find out about that until gate return.

The bleed configuration was still the same from takeoff: engine bleeds on; APU bleed off; packs auto; isolation valve auto; recirc fans on; trim air on. Around this time we entered icing conditions and turned the engine anti-ice on. Moments later we received a call from the cabin. They reported a 'strong burning' smell; no visible smoke; and it was not obvious where it was coming from. While the First Officer (FO) and I began to diagnose the situation we received another call from the cabin indicating that odor was getting worse. The FO and I put our oxygen masks on; [requested priority handling] to return to ZZZ. Throughout the event the Flight Attendants (FA) reported difficulty breathing; dizziness; and one of them developed a nose bleed. We ran the non-normal checklist. The Flight Attendants reported that odor/fumes had improved in the back of the aircraft and the forward Flight Attendant stated it was no longer getting worse. The approach and landing was normal. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) did a thermal scan of the aircraft after we cleared the runway. Everything on the exterior of the aircraft appeared normal. We taxied to the terminal and deplaned normally. The Flight Attendants reported that none of the passengers had requested medical assistance. The number 4 Flight Attendant with the nose bleed reported they were in stable condition to complete the deplaning process and was treated for the condition afterwards.Communicating with the oxygen masks on is very loud and adds a distraction and barrier to communication.

The mechanic that was on the aircraft came up to the flight deck. He checked for faults but nothing. The aircraft to our right was getting de-iced and we figured with the wind it probably injected a little of the de-ice fluid and it was going away. The mechanic released the flight saying it was probably deciding fluid.

Ensured Captain remained pilot flying (PF) by stating 'Your Aircraft' and ran the Quick Reference Checklist. As I was running the Quick Reference Checklist the ECAM went away and the vibration subsided. We monitored engine parameters for abnormalities and found that the #1 Engine had a higher EGT than the #2 Engine but still in the green (normal limits). We (PF and (PM) pilot monitoring) began reviewing QRH material and potential diversion airports in the event the engine continued to have issues. We came up with a plan for enroute diversion if needed; and briefed what we should do if the engine failed on descent or on approach. Planned a Flaps 3 approach; reviewed Single Engine go-around and 10-7 requirements. The engine continued to run at about 30-60 degrees hotter than the #2 Engine; but still well within normal ops limits. No further vibrations at altitude. No issues during descent. I monitored and continued to write down EGT for both engines on descent (and presented to [contract maintenance]). Turning final at about 2;000-2;500 ft. MSL the #1 Engine began to vibrate slightly; as the gear was lowered and Flaps 3 was initiated the engine began to vibrate substantially; spitting and sputtering. I announced to the Captain (PF) that Engine #1 was failing based on the reduction in power and higher EGT. An ECAM appeared stating ENG 1 STALL. As we were about 3-4 miles from landing and immediately after ECAM I ensured Captain had the aircraft; reviewed the QRC; as the ECAM went away again PF pulled #1 thrust lever back as I guarded #2 thrust lever. I ensured Captain placed #2 thrust lever in maximum continuous thrust. We decided to continue on a Single Engine approach and landing after a very brief discussion (as we had already briefed this earlier in flight if the engine were to fail on final). I requested priority handling to ZZZ; stated nature of the situation (southeast landing; engine failure; Souls on Board; Fuel on board) and that we would taxi clear. The Captain (PF) landed uneventfully as the #1 Engine had remained in operating limits after reducing power. Upon landing I started the APU. As we taxied clear of the runway the Tower controller stated that the #1 Engine was on fire and that she saw flames coming out the back as well as smoke. We just then received an ECAM stating the ENG 1 OIL FILTER CLOGGED. The Captain immediately shut the #1 Engine down. I asked the Captain if he wanted to consider the evacuation checklist; but then The Tower Controller stated the flames had dissipated but there was a great deal of smoke still coming from the engine exhaust. Then the Tower Controller stated the smoke was subsiding. We did not attempt to run the evacuation checklist because the flames/smoke situation appeared under control. We had already stopped on the ramp area clear of other aircraft; and as the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) trucks approached we attempted to gain comms with the trucks. We could not get the same frequency as the ARFF trucks and relayed information through the Tower Controller and attempted hand signals with the ARFF crew. The ARFF crews stopped approximately 30 yards from the front of the aircraft and approached without equipment as it appeared the fire had gone out. There were no indications of fire from inside the cockpit. After ARFF inspection we taxied to the hardstand area for further inspection before allowing passengers to deplane via air-stairs. It would have been nice to have the ARFF frequency available to communicate directly with ARFF as they approached rather than relaying through Tower frequency.

This aircraft had a write up about excessive dead band in roll control in flight which was cleared by Maintenance. 30 ft. above ground I felt something is not right; and I felt my aileron had no authority. The aircraft jerked twice and was not responsive. Upon reaching 1000 ft; retracted the flaps and accelerated to 210 kts. During a turn to the left again; I felt the aircraft was not turning the way it should; even when I had good control column input. I remember reading the logbook about dead band in roll movement and realized I was in the same situation. Climbed to 8;000 ft. and asked for a few different headings from the Departure Controller to see if is getting better but no change. The turn was either sluggish to one side or sharp to the opposite side. Tried to get a phone patch to Maintenance Controller with no luck.

Landing was uneventful.",,"The Captain and I were performing originating Flight XXXX ZZZ-ZZZ1 on a very cold morning. On preflight we noticed a recent closed write up in the logbook involving roll control relating to a dead band in the ailerons on Day 0 and took note. On the walk around I noticed a fluid drip/leak on #2 Engine requiring an engine run per Maintenance Control prior to flight to ensure the leak didn't get worse. The leak stopped with the engine run. This event is unrelated to the event but added to our pre-departure duties. Engine start and pre-takeoff duties all normal. The flight control check felt normal on our Before Taxi Check. In fact we cycled through the control check approximately 3 times to circulate the hydraulic fluid being the first flight of the day and sub-freezing ambient temperature. The wind on take-off was 300@11 kts per Tower; a slight right crosswind to Runway XX.They gave us a heading of 260 degrees; a vector; with the take-off clearance. Immediately after rotation the Captain commented on the abnormal mushiness and lack of roll control. We cleaned up the aircraft at 1000 ft. and very gradually turned to a heading of 260 out of caution and to get a feel for what was actually occurring and continued to climb. Departure Control gave us a southerly heading; the Captain; cautiously banked the aircraft and maintained a controlled turn but still experiencing the non-linear roll in the control wheel. After rollout we tried engaging the autopilot. After a couple tries; the autopilot took the aircraft for a second then disengaged and put the aircraft in CWS (Control Wheel Steering) modes bank and pitch. We re-activated the flight modes Heading and Level Change to continue hand-flying the climb out of around 4000 ft. at this point.Departure cleared us direct to an eastbound fix on our route. After making the slow turn; we agreed to level off and start communicating a plan of action to make a return to ZZZ as the aircraft felt UNSAFE to fly and continue. We requested a heading and altitude while we sorted things out. We contacted Ops to relay messages to Dispatch our problem and get a phone patch. The phone patch I guess wasn't capable with ZZZ Ops for some reason and communicated through ACARS with Dispatch of our problem and intentions. They seemed onboard with our decision to return. We let the Flight Attendants (FAs) know about our return as well as an appropriate PA to the passengers. We requested and received radar vectors for the visual back to Runway XX after briefing; setup; and landing performance and checklists were performed.

He says he usually runs the trim around 3 seconds in each direction and everything was normal.The takeoff trim was around 5.0 and on taxi out very little adjustment was needed from where it was left on preflight. First Officer did the takeoff and immediately told me it did not feel right. He gave me the controls and asked me to check my trim function. It would only chatter and the wheel would not rotate. I kept control of the aircraft and we coordinated a return to ZZZ. First Officer got into the checklists which were not too useful. The big things were do not use autopilot and do not use auto throttle. The airplane was a little nose heavy but totally flyable. With that in mind we decided to limit the troubleshooting (Company came to mind). First Officer checked the circuit breakers; all in.We both tried manual trim. It was jammed. We got vectored around for the ILS and I landed uneventfully and we taxied to the gate. Once on the ground we tried manual trim again; still jammed. We tried electric trim and it would trim maybe 1 rotation nose down. Nose up trim would just chatter.The FA (Flight Attendant) in the back galley said he could hear unusual noises (groaning mechanical sounds) once on the ground as we taxied in. This corresponds with us trying the trim on the ground. The missing information is going to come from maintenance. I kept my [report] short because there was not much we could do other than fly the aircraft as it was. First Officer did an outstanding job backing me up. It really could not have gone any better. I have no second thoughts or regrets concerning our actions.I hope this is what you are looking for.

We thought this might just be a loud airplane.When we were at about FL216 I noticed our climb rate was zero and sometimes negative. There were tailwinds of approximately 50 kts. The Captain; also Pilot Flying (PF); selected speed from our current 320 kts. to 280 kts.. The aircraft initiated a climb but I don't recall climbing more than about 600 FPM and we didn't climb for long. Maybe a few hundred feet. I suggested to use vertical speed. The airspeed slowed as much as 260 kts. and we were climbing at a selected vertical speed up 1;200-1;500 FPM. I originally thought that we were having an auto flight problem; perhaps. I checked all the system pages and found them to be normal. The Engine Pressure Ratio was 1.34 I recall and thrust indication matched thrust lever angle cyan circles. At some point before this when the TAT reached 10 Degrees C; I had turned on the engine A/I. Both PFDs and the standby indicator matched airspeed indications. Finally; I had the idea to turn off the dome light and turn on the ice light and wing lights. I saw a large piece of clear ice on the ice indicator and it extended horizontally approximately 1 inch per side. The wings were somewhat hard to be sure but looked to have a good amount of clear but lumpy ice on them. I turned on the wing A/I after mentioning to the Captain.What I think happened was that the pitot tubes (all three) must have been frozen over and were no longer indicating accurate airspeed. Maybe the engine inlet sensors also as the Engine Pressure Ratio was lower than I would have expected and it increased some minutes after exiting the icing condition. I believe our airspeed was far higher than indicated as I've never heard wind noise that loud in the cockpit before. The plane seemed to not have enough power to maintain an altitude of FL 290 and had full power going Mach .78. After a few minutes the aircraft seemed to fly better and although Engine Pressure Ratio was now limited to I believe 1.44; the engines did not need to be at max thrust.This is a hard situation to fully understand because I'm not sure if the icing and its weight and drag were a larger factor or that I believe all three airspeed indicators might be iced over.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported excessive wind noise on climbout.

My last flight highlighted the issues. Landing on XL in ZZZ; the ATIS was reporting +TSRA and 2 1/2 miles visibility. We were cleared for the ILS Runway XR. At minimums; the Pilot Flying (PF) announced 'landing'. While the runway was somewhat distorted by the rain piling up on the windshield; neither of us felt it was bad enough to call for the go-around. Here lies the problem with not treating the windshields with a hydrophobic coating. The crew is lulled into a false sense of security to continue the landing. However; I believe; based on experience; that the Pilot's depth perception is severely and unknowingly impaired by the distorted view.This was just what we experienced. Just before touchdown; we got a Sink Rate Aural Warning. It was too late in the flare to initiate a go-around; as we touched down almost immediately after the warning.  As you might imagine; it was a hard landing. What was unnerving to us both was that neither of us had the slightest inclination that the aircraft was sinking. I attribute this to our distorted view through the windshield.  We felt that we had adequate visual reference to continue the landing; but clearly; we unknowingly did not. I have seen this happen other times as well and always in heavy rain. I happen to know that other airlines maintain their windshields better than we do. When I observed (other carrier) land immediately after us in the same conditions; they had a much more normal touchdown. I have worked for operators; in the past; who maintained the hydrophobic coating and never had any issues landing in heavy rain. We also didn't even have windshield wipers on our aircraft. I strongly believe Company is assuming unnecessary risk by choosing to operate this way.",,,,"B737-800 First Officer reported vision problems caused by the hydrophobic coating on the windscreens caused misjudgments and an excessive sink rate during landing.

During cruise flight at (estimated) XA45Z the autopilot disengaged because of a #1 IRU failure. This caused my attitude indications and nav indications to disappear from my display screens. I immediately transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer who became the Flying Pilot for the remainder of the flight. I proceeded to perform the ECAM actions; which were minimal; other than noting failures and clearing the items on the ECAM display. The normal procedure for recovering flight instruments is to place the ATT HDG control on the Switching Panel to CAPT 3. But because the #3 IRU was inoperative; this action did nothing. After finishing the ECAM actions I advised ATC that we had a flight control problem and that we needed to descend to a lower altitude (to clear RVSM airspace) and that we would get back to them when able. We were given clearance to FL260 but decided to level at FL280 after it was offered by ATC. I was unable to contact Dispatch via the Crew Phone application on my iPad because I did not have WIFI capability. I assume this was because of the double IRU failure; but I have not confirmed this assumption. We were too far east of the ZZZ1 area Dispatch Direct VHF Network; so I spent a few minutes locating the appropriate communications frequency for our location in order to get a phone patch to the Flight Dispatcher. After explaining the situation to Dispatch; we decided that a diversion to ZZZ2 would be the safest course of action. We then advised ATC of our plan and proceed to ZZZ2 airport. As a result of the loss of 2 IRU units; the inoperative aircraft systems were Autopilot; Auto Thrust; Flight Directors; and Yaw Damper #1. The weather for the entire flight; from failure to landing; was VMC. We did not have navigation ability; so we were given radar vectors all the way to the localizer for Runway XXR at ZZZ2. We decided not to request priority handling for this situation as we felt the aircraft was fully controllable; the weather was good; and a normal landing was anticipated. The flight landed without further problems and proceeded to park normally at the assigned gate. An IRU failure on its own would not have caused any significant problems or the necessity to divert. However because of the inoperative #3 IRU; this became a much more problematic situation. I do not know the reason for the failure of the #1 IRU so I have no insight as to the causal factors beyond the application of an MEL to the #3 IRU. I believe this was a very rare occurrence. The failure of a second IRU unit is obviously considered a low probability event. Otherwise the MEL application would not be approved. I do not have any suggestions on how to prevent this type of event in the future.",,"IR3 was differed item before the flight; I checked the procedures during preflight and complied. We were cruising FL350; autopilot disconnected; initially I thought the Captain disconnected auto pilot inadvertently. Then Captain asked me what happened; from their question I realized it was a problem with the aircraft. I told him 'YOUR AIRPLANE' Captain replied back 'Your airplane I don't have instruments indications'. I took the airplane; and radios; I asked the Captain if I should request priority handling they replied no; not at this moment. I called ATC and I told them we had a problem with degraded flight controls; and no auto flight system; Controller asked me if I was requesting priority handling; I told ATC no; and that we were troubleshooting the problem and would keep them updated. I requested to descend to FL260 to leave RVSM airspace and it was approved; I also advised ATC that I might not be as accurate as the autopilot to maintain altitude and heading they replied it was not a problem; they were very helpful on the situation. On the Captain's side 'NO Quick Action; No ECAM Exemption; it was ECAM Action. I commanded ECAM ACTIONS.... Captain completed ECAM ACTIONS.IR3 was a deferred item in the MEL and we lost IR 1; having only IR 2 working only. The Captain briefed the Flight Attendants about the situation. Dispatch send us new paperwork for flying at FL260. The Captain checked the documents and told me we were good with fuel and weather to continue to ZZZ3; I suggested to deviate to ZZZ2 instead since it was closer and we could not take a chance; they considered my advice and agreed. They took the communications back and requested the deviation to ZZZ2; weather conditions were good; night time; some crosswind; I requested to get briefed on details of the approach; reviewed the status and requested vectors to land; at gear down aircraft entered in Direct; controls were a bit different as expected.

After requesting priority handling; we followed the CABIN ALTITUDE procedure and deployed the O2 to the Passengers. I believe I asked for a descent to the lowest safe altitude and were cleared to 12;000 ft. We were not far from ZZZZ so I knew we would not be held above 10;000 ft. for very long due to the mountains in the area. I asked the FB (First Officer B) to run a non-normal overweight landing assessment.As I was completing the overweight landing checklist; the checklist indicated we needed to do a flaps 25 landing. However; the landing assessment indicated we needed to do a flaps 20 landing. This is where the confusion for me and the FO started....Both of us firmly believed that all overweight landings were done at flaps 20 yet the checklist indicated flaps 25.... Our belief was supported by the landing assessment completed by the FB from the 'non-normal' section of the landing app as I had instructed him to do.Not having any resolution with the conflicting information; I decided to complete the approach using flaps 20 since it provided a better margin of safety if a go around would have been necessary with one or two engines operating. This airport has terrain in proximity and the runway in use has an 'Engine failure Procedure' missed approach. Considering all of this; I was satisfied to continue the approach and landing at flaps 20...We held over the airport for a couple turns to complete our checklists then commenced our approach to XXR. 		Once we cleared the runway; we stopped on the inner taxiway so the Fire Chief could give us his report. Our Company Mechanic was the liaison to communicate with the Fire Chief...He used turbo fans to cool the gear then offered to hose off the landing gear with water. I did not know if water was appropriate with the gear as hot as it was so I asked Local Maintenance and Maintenance in ZZZ through the Sat-phone if I should give the Fire Chief the go-ahead. 	They offered no guidance. So I agreed with the Chief and they commenced with watering the hot landing gear down.I asked the FB to refer to the Brake Cooling chart in the QRH to get a time for cooling which was about 85 minutes. While we sat there five tires flattened out.Coordination with our Maintenance; Operations and Dispatch in ZZZ all worked well to see to our needs. Air stairs were provided along with busses to transport everyone to the terminal. I held everyone on the plane until the gear temperatures were in a safe range... Some of the difficulties with this event included communications with the Controller I was talking to initially at the start of the event. Her English was fine but the quality of her radio was horrible. I remember asking her a half a dozen times to repeat her clearance because we couldn't understand her. Day 0. XA15 ZAfter I submitted this report; the review page had errors.. The nose number should be Aircraft X. I don't know the tail number offhand.. The aircraft type is 777-300.Day 0 0XA21 ZThe date of the event... in Zulu time was Day 0.With regard to the pressurization issue; Maintenance will make the determination as to why it happened. I flew this aircraft a week earlier. When I showed up to the aircraft to begin that sequence; the cockpit was filled with Mechanics trying to clear three status messages. I believe they were for both Outflow Valves and one for Cabin Altitude. Regarding the procedures for the overweight landing... Having time to review the events; the biggest distraction for my decision making was my preconceived notion that flaps 20 is the setting for an overweight landing. My First Officer (FO) had the same perspective. Now having reviewed the procedure; I see that the flaps 20 landing is tied to a single engine landing and not a two engine landing. During our annual training we go through this exercise and it is always tied to an engine failure. I think this is why my convection for insisting on using flaps 20 was so strong. Adding to that; I asked the FB for a non-normal landing assessment which is the; Flaps 20 landing (overweight; etc.) failure.... Located in the non-normal category in the landing app. This also supported my decision for a flaps 20 landing...It is obvious now that it was the wrong place to go for that information. Using the Normal landing assessment for this abnormal situation was the place to go. Reviewing all of this in the aftermath of this event; it is obvious that flaps 25 was the appropriate flap setting.Some of the abnormal procedures as they are written are difficult to understand. In the heat of the moment; there were a couple of decision questions that I couldn't understand. Now after a careful review; I have a better understanding of this procedure but in the heat of the moment it was very confusing. Suggestions:Complete understanding of the checklist procedures.",,"This was a night takeoff out of ZZZZ and I was the FB (First Officer B) on this flight. Going into this flight we were advised that we needed to do an inflight check on the PACKs. The Captain talked to Dispatch to verify what we needed to do to accomplish the checks. The Captain mentioned that we needed to wait to chime the Flight Attendants (FAs) at 15;000 ft. due to mountainous terrain before they were let up to begin service. After the chime was made the First Officer (FO) noticed the Cabin Altitude was not scheduling appropriately; I think it was approximately around 9;200 ft. We all confirmed this was the case; we were still climbing along with the Cabin Altitude. When we hit 10;000 ft. on the Cabin Altitude we received the CABIN ALTITUDE Warning. The Alert was acknowledged; at that point I stated that we needed to get our oxygen mask on; which we all did. The Captain assigned the FO flying duties (the FO was already the pilot flying) and the Captain pulled out the QRC and started the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist from the card. We were still in the climb and needed to level off. The Captain asked if we all agreed if we were in an urgent situation and we did. The Captain [requested priority handling] and let ATC know that we needed to return to ZZZZ and level off and descend back down. We ultimately leveled off at FL210 but took some time to get back down below 9;000 ft. During this time the Captain had pushed the PASS OXYGEN switch since the Cabin Pressurization continued to climb (I think it topped out at approximately 12;600 ft.). During this time the Captain had me call the #1 FA and advise them that we lost our Cabin Pressurization and will be coming back to ZZZZ and doing a Precautionary Landing and to expect the fire trucks to be around. We would call them back with more information once we had time. We worked with ATC to get us to a minimum safe altitude and set up for a hold so we can run through the checklist. The captain asked me to run the landing distance for our weight which was approximately 638;000 pounds and an overweight landing. I proceeded to use the normal landing distance portion of the app and gave the weights the landing distance for the different brake configurations 3 through auto max; with a 5 - wet/good braking action and flaps 25 and a Pressure Altitude of 3;000 ft. After giving this information the Captain advised we needed to use Flaps 20 and I believe I said that is not an option and I was then directed to use the non-normal portion of the landing app. I pulled the information for FLAPS 20 Landing (overweight) and provided the landing distance with the before mentioned parameters. Going through the overweight landing checklist we all agreed that it would be a VREF 30 + additives (wind and gusts; 5 knots minimum) is above 170 kts. At that point VREF 25 was selected but still planned to use FLAPS 20 for landing. When doing the landing checklist; I mentioned that we will not be able to complete the checklist (unless we were to override; which I did not say) if we had VREF 25 and flaps set at 20. Since the plan was to land Flaps 20 it was then set to VREF 20. The FO made a nice landing using FLAPS 20 and auto max brakes and rolled out; while passing controls to the Captain around 60 kts; all the way to Taxiway X; which was 10;685 ft. down the runway.We started our taxi back to the gate and noticed our brake temps were hot. At this point the Captain stopped the aircraft; we talked to Ground and let them know we could not move; and the parking brake was not set. The Captain had us reference the QRH for the Recommended Brake Cooling Schedule and it appeared it would take approximately 85 minutes to cool. During this time the Fire Chief was already present; and they had checked our brakes; which were indeed hot. At this point the Fire Chief determined that they needed to cool the brakes with water and the team started to cool all the brakes with water. Eventually they were able to hook up a tow to ouraircraft and chock the wheels; so the captain and FO were no longer having to hold the brakes manually. Ultimately five of the tires' plugs opened to release the pressure in the tires. Since we were not able to taxi the Captain worked with Dispatch; since it was a little bit of a challenge due to the language differences; to get stairs; a lift for the wheelchairs; and busses so the Passengers can get off the aircraft and back to the terminal.Two more things to add about the Flight Attendants; they did a really good job of waiting for us to provide them with information vice calling us while we were in flight. Also; the Captain did a nice job trying to slow everything down; assign task; and keep all players in the loop.Cause: The loss of cabin altitude.Deciding to use flaps 20 and the use of the non-normal landing app and using flaps 20 overweight landing; vice just using the normal landing app and selecting flaps 25 or 30 if that is what is called for.Would help to have and overweight landing on the non-normal side of the landing app. Overweight landing is a non-normal and does place us in an emergency situation. It could give you the same answer as the normal side of the landing app; but maybe not cause any confusion. I now remember in training they had us pull up the non-normal side and note that there was not an overweight option on the landing app.Suggestions: If the cabin altitude were to hold and schedule correctly that would help. Maybe add overweight landing to the non-normal side of the landing app too.",,"Flight Crew reported loss of Cabin Pressure Control in climb. The Cabin Altitude climbed above 12;500 ft. and the O2 masks were deployed. The Flight Crew requested priority handling and immediately descended. The Flight Crew preformed an air turn back and made an overweight landing at departure airport.",

A little over an hour into the flight we were level at FL370; talking to ZZZZ Center; and the Relief Pilot was on first break. It was at this time the Captain and I felt a jolt; the airplane began to yaw; and a significant vibration began. We looked at the engine instruments and determined we had lost thrust on the Number 1 Engine with a rising EGT of 692 degrees at the time. The Captain was the Pilot Flying so they took control of the aircraft and called for the QRC and the Engine Fire; Severe Damage; Separation Checklist. After completing the appropriate QRC and Non-Normal checklists we [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center; requested FL250 (drift down ALT was 26700 ft. @ 244 kts); and decided to divert to ZZZZ1. At this point the Relief Pilot was back in the cockpit and the Captain delegated duties for them and myself to go over the checklists one more time; contact the Flight Attendants (FAs); contact Dispatch; monitor cross-feeding fuel; and set ourselves up for our approach into ZZZZ1. We had no center tank fuel so we did not dump fuel and our landing weight was 300;000 lbs. below maximum landing weight. We requested the ILS to Runway XX with an alternate missed approach of straight out runway heading and up to 3000 ft. Our arrival; approach; and landing were uneventful. After landing we stopped on the runway and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Personnel inspect the exterior of the aircraft; especially our Number 1 Engine. Once they gave us the all clear we taxi to the gate without any issue.",,"While on my rest break; I both felt and heard a large shudder and airframe vibration from the left side of the aircraft at approximately XA:00 UTC. Assuming we had had an engine failure; I left the rest area to the forward galley to speak with the Purser. The Purser was unsure of what was going on and informed me they had been trying to call the flight deck but was unsuccessful. I told them that I believed we had had an engine failure and that they would call back for me when they were ready. I then took a Flight Attendant jump-seat in the forward galley and awaited the phone call from the flight deck which happened about a minute later. We set up for me to enter the flight deck and proceeded in once it was secure. Upon arrival to the flight deck I found that indeed the Left Engine had failed and was vibrating quite badly as we could feel the airframe vibrations. The Captain and First Officer had already accomplished the Severe Engine Damage QRC and Engine Fire QRH. We were also already in our descent to a safe drift-down altitude and diverting to ZZZZ1. After I was briefed on what was happening and what the plan was; I was tasked with trying to reach Dispatch over the SATCOM. After several attempts to reach Dispatch over SATCOM I had to give up after receiving no answer. The phone would dial but there would be no answer. I informed the rest of the crew that I was unable to reach Dispatch over SATCOM so the Captain sent an ACARS message when time allowed in the descent. After this I took a look at the QRC/QRH procedures that had been accomplished and verified that everything had been done and started to monitor our fuel balance. Once all of this had been done I was delegated to keep the Flight Attendants informed of what was going on and give them their briefing. After concurring with the Captain; it was determined that we had about 15 mins of flight time left to ZZZZ1 at this point; we would have the Flight Attendants prepare for an evacuation; and we had no special comments. I passed this information along to the Flight Attendants and then we briefed the ILS XX and prepared to land at ZZZZ1. The Captain briefed us using our briefing card and we discussed the threats of having an engine failure; night landing; and unfamiliar airport. We also discussed that once on the ground we would come to a complete stop on the runway and then once stopped I would make an announcement to the passengers to Remain Seated; Remain Seated and we would have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspect the Left Engine for any fire or cause for potential fire and then base our next steps after their findings. We then ran the deferred items Descent Checklist from the QRH. After we briefed and within the terminal area I identified the localizer for Runway XX and then quickly called to Door1L to update them on our time to touchdown which was about 5 minutes from that point. At this point we were on a downwind and being vectored for a 10 mile final for [Runway] XX. The Pilot Monitoring First Officer (FO) coordinated with ATC for a potential go around where we would need to fly runway heading up to 3000 ft. and this was approved if necessary. From here we continued to be vectored and set up for a flaps 20 landing as per the QRH and ran the deferred items Before Landing Checklist from the QRH. The Captain then made a stabilized approach and landing on Runway XX and stopped on the runway and accomplished what we had briefed in the air. I made a PA to the passengers to make them aware of the ARFF trucks approaching the airplane out of an abundance of caution and told them to remain seated. ARFF determined that there was no fire or fire hazard so we then coordinated with Dispatch about getting a gate which they already had and prepared to move the airplane under our own power to the gate. At this point I made another PA to the passengers informing them of this and that although we did have a gate it would take some time to get off the airplane as we would have to coordinate with Customs and that for the time being should remain seated until everything had been figured out. I then made a call to the Purser and told them the same information and that it would be a couple mins before getting to the gate but that there was currently no threat of an evacuation and would proceed to the gate as normal. Once clear of the runway; the FO accomplished the after landing flow; we taxied to the gate; set the parking break and accomplished the parking flow and checklist and then except leaving the fasten seat belt sign on as we did not want the passengers to unnecessarily get up until it was determined that they could. The Purser then called asking if it was okay to disarm the doors and allow them to be opened which we said yes to and then opened the flight deck door and began coordinating with Authorities and Airport Personnel what our next steps would be.",,"B767 flight crew reported a #1 Engine Failure in cruise followed by significant vibration.

Completed the ECAM procedures; checked for follow up in QRH; contacted dispatch/maintenance to discuss best course of action. I decided that a divert to ZZZ was required. Aircraft would have only single reverser; 40% of ground spoilers would not work; and nose wheel steering would be inoperative after landing. I chose ZZZ because it has long runways; and I knew my landing distance would be affected by the failures. The diversion was made; the landing was completed. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was on scene and looked over the aircraft. We were then hooked to a super tug to be towed to the gate. While crossing the boundary from Ground Control to Ramp Control; the escort vehicle leading the tug stopped at the ramp entrance; and the tug carrying the aircraft was unable to stop and hit the escort vehicle. No damage was noted by me; and I believe the collision speed was less than 1 mph. Upon arrival at the gate the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML) was filled out for the yellow hydraulic failure; and the collision with the ground vehicle. Approximately one minute after I received an ECAM for the low hydraulic level; the flight attendant called me to notify me that we had a passenger that was having an 'anxiety attack'. There was weather in the ZZZ1 area and we had light to moderate turbulence for approximately 40 minutes during the climbout. This was also my First Officer's first trip off OE as a new hire pilot. Several causal factors played a role in the event. 1) Widespread convective activity in the ZZZ1 area gave us a pretty rough ride; which was concerning enough for at least one passenger to become distressed. This did not have any relevance to the rest of the event except that it was distracting to deal with during the course of the event. 2) New hire FO. This trip was the First Officer's first trip off OE at Airline X. The event occurred on the third leg of the trip. He is an experienced pilot from Airline Y and did a fantastic job. 3) Dispatch/Maintenance. In making my decision to divert to ZZZ; I contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control to confer about the issues. Dispatch told me that operationally; they would've preferred the aircraft to be in ZZZ2. I decided to divert to ZZZ because I could not justify flying for another two hours; and then [request priority handling] because of the landing distance issues. 4) After landing process. I had let Dispatch and Maintenance know the nature of the [problem]; and that we would need to be towed off of the runway to the gate. After ARFF looked over the aircraft; Maintenance showed up in a pick up truck with gear pins and were told that they just needed to pin the gear and I would taxi to the gate. I informed them that I had no nose wheel steering and I would have to be towed with a tug. The whole event from landing; to getting a tug; to removal from the runway took approximately 20 to 30 minutes because the tug was not waiting for us when we landed. This tied up the runway in ZZZ while they were doing instrument approaches. To me it just seemed like there wasn't adequate coordination done before we got there.I don't believe that there is anything that could've been done to resolve the hydraulic issue; but I do have some observations about things that may be would've been helpful. 1) I've been involved with two [priority handling requests] in the last six months and it doesn't seem to me that Dispatch is much of a resource. I generally have the expectation that I'm calling them to help me with my issue; but I think that I've learned that I need to have a course of action decided and just tell them what I'm going to do. 2) When we arrived at the gate; there was a slew of people in the jetway to meet us; the ARFF event commander; in-flight coordinator; etc. I never got a chance to talk to the tug driver because he had unplugged and driven off and was gone to his next assignment before I got a chance to thank him or discuss the event. The collision was not his fault; and I wanted to let him know that but to also let him know that it had to go in the AML. 3) The Flight Attendants were gone before I ever got a chance to thank them or debrief them. They elected not to continue with their trip and went home; I think in the future I will make sure that I get the opportunity to debrief everybody; but I was so busy talking to ARFF; mechanics; etc. that I never got the chance. 4) I have decided that in the future; if I have to [request priority handling]; once we land; the trip will be over for me. I agreed to swap aircraft and fly the remainder of the flight and passengers to ZZZ2; because crew scheduling told us that once we got to ZZZ2; we would be done and could go to the hotel for the night. Enroute; they reassigned us to an additional leg after we got to ZZZ2. I was to deadhead on the flight to ZZZ; and my First Officer was to fly it. This makes for a very exhausting day when the first leg was a [priority handling event] and erodes the safety margin. The First Officer told me that at Airline Y; it is policy that if you [request priority handling] you are done and are removed from the rest of the trip. Being a new hire on his first trip with Airline X; he didn't have the choice not to do the leg. I will not allow that to happen again.",,,,"Air carrier flight crew reported hydraulic system malfunction in cruise flight.",

I was the pilot flying; so I told Person A that I had the radios and asked them to run the associated Non-normal Checklist. I was not familiar with this malfunction; but it became immediately clear that there was a possibility that we may have to shut down the engine. I asked Person A to hold on for a second and I transmitted to ATC that we wanted to level off at FL190 in order to work a possible engine problem and that I would get back to them with more information shortly; which was approved as requested. Realizing the possible severity of the situation and the possibility of some very challenging checklists ahead; I decided to swap roles and have Person A fly and run the comms; while I ran the associated checklists for the problem. I started the checklist; which called for turning off the autothrottle and retarding the engine until either the message goes out or it is at idle. I coordinated this with Person A so that they could smoothly apply the needed rudder to compensate for the loss of thrust; which went very smoothly all the way to idle with the message still illuminated. I then knew we were going to shut down the engine; so I took the radios back and with ATC; told them we were returning to ZZZ and needed a turn back toward the airport; and would like to enter a holding pattern in order to run the checklists; and that I would get back to them shortly with the rest of their required information. I then sent a CALL ME message to Dispatch and; while I awaited their reply; I called the Purser and asked them to get out their device because I needed to give them the briefing. They got out the device and I told them that we had to shut down an engine; we are not planning an evacuation; there are no special instructions; we would be returning to ZZZ and landing in about 15 minutes; and that I would make an announcement to the passengers soon.I then called Dispatch on the frequency I was sent; but the transmission was broken and unreadable; so I sent a DIVERT message with a quick note about shutting down an engine and returning to ZZZ. I then went to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist and secured the engine accordingly; turned on the APU for power; and called ATC back with fuel and souls onboard and asked them for a lower altitude. They gave us 12;000 ft.; which caused us to have to use engine anti-ice during the descent; which I selected on for the operational engine. During this time they were vectoring us in an extended holding type pattern. I decided this was a good time to brief the passengers. In a calm voice; I told them that we had to shut down one of our engines; we would be returning to ZZZ; please follow all instructions from the flight attendants; and that I would talk to them on the ground shortly.I then continued to the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist down to the items including the Non-normal Configuration Landing Distance table for our aircraft. We were well below max landing weight for the 900ER. At this point; I checked in with Person A to make sure they were ok and on board with everything that we had done up to that point; which they were. I decided to quickly type a more detailed message to Dispatch stating that we had in fact shut down the Left Engine and would be landing in ZZZ soon; to which they replied that everyone had been advised and that we should return to Gate XXX.I then got landing data for [Runway] XYR; loaded and briefed the ILS including the complex procedure for that runway; adjusted the target speed on the FMS approach page; and since we were in heading mode on vectors; I extended the runway centerline off of ZZZZZ1 with a 284 inbound course. I asked Person A if they wanted to also brief the approach because they were going to be flying it; but they were satisfied with everything I had set up for the approach. I then asked for lower so that we could run the Deferred Items Checklist. When we got below 10;000 ft.; I configured the bleed panel; reviewed the flaps 1 go-around with the procedure; and told ATC we were ready for the approach. We were given a vector to intercept the XYR localizer; and since were over 25 miles from the airport; I told Person A that we would need to use LNAV until we were closer in for a better localizer signal. As we rolled wings level; I went to select LNAV but realized the FMS had re-sequenced and the final course was off of the FAF and the magenta line was not far enough out for us to intercept. As I was correcting this problem; we got a TA for an aircraft below us. My immediate concern was that we may have overshot the final approach course; so I told Person A to initiate a right turn and spun the heading bug about 15 degrees right. It turned out that we had not overshot the final and the traffic was just someone climbing out below us and leveling 1;000 ft. below our altitude. I finished extending the centerline off of ZZZZZ1 and rejoined the final. At around 15 miles out we selected approach mode and started configuring for landing. Reaching flaps 15; I ran the Landing Checklist and we proceeded to land uneventfully and taxied to the gate. I thanked the passengers for their understanding and cooperation; then called Dispatch and the Chief Pilot.",,,,"B737 Captain reported an Oil Filter Bypass Light caution message appeared while climbing that required an engine shutdown as part of the checklists.

While allowed per MEL; I do not like to fly over water on one pack; especially at night; and even more so when it's the first flight on a single pack. So I contacted Operations Control via Dispatch to ask for a different aircraft. Operations Control said none were available. I also emailed the Duty Chief Pilot for assistance but they never got back to me before departure time. I considered refusing the aircraft; but the FO (First Officer) and I chose not to. We planned to monitor the pressurization system more closely; knowing it was degraded. We boarded and departed on time. Initial climb-out was uneventful. Passing 10;000 ft.; we took a close look at the pressurization parameters and all looked normal. We continued to climb to FL290. We were busy in the climb conducting the numerous procedures required for Class II operations. After a few minutes at FL290 we were cleared to climb to FL330.As we initiated the climb; the Lower ECAM switched to the PRESS page and displayed the Cabin Altitude Advisory; flashing at 8;800 ft. and climbing. I pushed the V/S knob to level off at approximately FL294. It appeared that with Pack 1 OFF per MEL; our one remaining pack was 'weak' and not able to fully pressurize the aircraft. We noted the outflow valve was closed. No ECAM cautions or warnings were present.Since the cabin altitude continued to climb even while level at FL294; I directed the FO to request an immediate descent to 10;000 ft. ZZZ Center cleared us right away to descend and maintain 10;000 ft. I selected 10;000 ft. in the FCU (Fuel Control Unit) and began an open descent. At this point the cabin altitude indicated above 9;550 ft. and turned red; so I proactively announced "emergency descent" even though the cabin altitude was still below 10;000 ft. The FO read the QRC checklist and I began a descent with autopilot off and spoilers fully extended. At the same time I stated out loud; 'We need to go back to ZZZ.' The FO advised ATC of our descent and the desire to return to ZZZ. We were additionally cleared to turn right direct ZZZ. Once the descent was established; we began the right turn towards ZZZ. I noticed no traffic at all within 20 NM of the aircraft during the descent and turn back via TCAS on ND (Navigation Display); and out the windows. I selected Terrain on ND to ensure we were over water as expected. It was a pitch black night with no horizon or visual cues.As we descended; the cabin altitude continued to climb above 9;550 ft. but at a slower rate. Then approximately halfway through the descent; the Master Warning sounded as the cabin altitude reached 10;000 ft. Shortly thereafter the cabin began to descend as the aircraft got lower. I recall the cabin was only 100 - 200 ft. above 10;000 ft. for approximately 20 seconds. We did not don oxygen masks when the cabin altitude reached 10;000 ft. due to the high workload of hand-flying the descent on instruments and the transient nature of the excessive cabin altitude. We felt the priority was on maintaining safe control of the aircraft. A320 FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) 1 paragraph 5.1.2 states; "the pilot flying will be tasked with verifying the non-normal condition and confirming procedures… (but) it should not distract the pilot flying from his primary duty of safely flying the aircraft." However upon reflection; if the situation was progressing to the point where I thought declaring "emergency descent" was warranted; putting on our oxygen masks before beginning the descent would have been the better course of action. Upon leveling at 10;000 ft. we slowed to 250 kt.; re-engaged the autopilot; verified we were navigating direct to ZZZ as cleared; and assessed the situation. The cabin altitude was below 10;000 ft. and cabin vertical speed was at -250 FPM; descending. In fact as we transited back at 10;000 ft.; the cabin continued to descend normally and reached field elevation before we landed. We heard no unusual sounds indicating a leak of any kind. I next called the cabin to advise them of the situation and to check in on the cabin condition. They said everything was okay and the oxygen masks did not deploy. I told the F1 we were returning to ZZZ; landing in about 25 minutes. I said the landing would be normal but CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) may meet the aircraft. Next; we advised Dispatch via ACARS of our descent and plan to return to ZZZ. We initially set up the FMS for a return to ZZZ and ran the Overweight Landing Checklist. Planned landing weight was 154;000 lb. I then asked Dispatch if they preferred we go to ZZZ or ZZZ1; in case one was better than the other for our situation. Dispatch told us Operations Control preferred we go to ZZZ1 to facilitate an easier tail swap. We coordinated with ZZZ Center to divert to ZZZ1 and we reprogrammed the FMS again for ZZZ1. I continued to fly the aircraft and talk with ATC while the FO reprogrammed the FMS both times. ATC [provided priority handling] for us due to the descent; diversion; and planned overweight landing; and we concurred. I advised the flight attendants of our new plan to go to ZZZ1 and asked them to make a PA since we were in a descent below 10;000 ft. at this point and our workload was very high. The rest of the descent; approach and landing; ILS XXR ZZZ; were normal. Medium brakes were used per [the] software and max reverse per the Overweight Landing Checklist. Touchdown was in the touchdown zone at 200 FPM or less. ZZZ emergency equipment was dispatched to a location near the runway but they never approached the aircraft. We exited [Runway] XXR at [Taxiway] XX and taxied to [Taxiway] XY Gate XX normally.Brake fan use was delayed until brake temperatures reached 400°C on the left main gear; approximately 4 minutes after landing. Winds were 320 at 16 kt. for landing on [Runway] XXR. Brake temperatures never went much above 400°C and then began to cool. At the gate we wrote up the loss of pressurization and overweight landing. We debriefed Maintenance Control crew members face-to-face. We never ran the 'Diversion' checklist since both ZZZ and ZZZ1 are primary and well-known cities - we prioritized other necessary tasks. I provided the flight attendants all the information required for an event but I believe I may have failed to speak the words 'event' directly. The flight attendants confirmed with me after the flight that it was clear to them that it would be an event/normal landing.",,,,"A320 Captain reported the cabin was not pressurizing properly and the flight crew opted to divert.

The flight was part of a [flight with a Check Airman] sequence. All appropriate checklists were completed and the aircraft returned to ZZZ for a successful; but overweight; landing. The biggest additive condition that occurred during this event was due to the multitude of requests for information from Dispatch during high workload times. Before we even had the chance to assess the engine condition; balance our response and communicate with ATC; there were 2 ACARS messages from Dispatch; followed by further requests; while we were executing the QRH Checklist; including the question; 'Did you [request priority handling]?' Once on the ground; ZZZ Operations and Dispatch were asking for information; while we were coordinating with the Airport Fire Response teams; ATC for a place to wait while the brakes cooled; and dealing with the passengers to set their expectations. All of these requests should have waited until the aircraft was at the gate.In a [situation] like this; requests for information; unless directly associated with ensuring a successful outcome; should be kept until the more immediate necessity of safely getting the aircraft on the ground has been accomplished. The numerous requests for information are an additive and task loading condition that the crew does not need while executing the QRH procedure. While I understand the need for information in the Company Operations Center; none of the requests were helpful to the crew. Dispatch pushing the weather and gate info to us via ACARS; plus a request to call when able would have helped. A checklist of who to contact would be helpful AFTER the aircraft is shut down; the passengers and crew are taken care of; and the crew has a chance to recover.",,"The event occurred on the ZZZZZ Departure at FL230.

The EGT peaked just over 1;000 degrees; and did not go down until the checklist was run. We coordinated a return to ZZZ.

Captain was informed by Maintenance that the following items failed at Cruise.Autoflight System (AFS): FMGC2 64 AFS 1 Electronic Instrument System (EIS) 2; IR2; IR3; IR1; EIS1AFS: FMGC1 61. AFS 1 IR3; IR1; EIS1; EiS2 IR2CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULTFMGC2 (1CA2) BUS FM2/DMC2 (1WT2). EIS2The above failures began at 28;000 ft. approximately 150-180 miles from ZZZZ. The first indication of any problem was an auditory triple click; followed by GPS Primary lost on both the Captain and First Officer's (FO's) displays. What followed next was an ECAM action to set manual field elevation. I was Pilot Flying and verbalized my aircraft; my radios. At the same time Captain began to run the ECAM actions.Following ECAM actions; it was evident that we were having navigation issues. The primary flight plan and secondary flight plans were gone. While the Captain with his 19 years of Airbus experience worked diligently to re-establish a flight plan; I let ATC know of our issues and requested vectors and a lower altitude.The Captain was able to establish a partial flight plan with ZZZZ as our destination. This allowed points and altitudes to appear back in our MFD. However the aircraft would not manage to any point; any altitude or airspeed. Thus resulting in using HDG; open Decent and manual speeds for the remainder of the arrival and approach.Not being able to arm an approach in either AP1 (Autopilot 1); or AP2 (Autopilot 2) a visual approach to landing was preformed. Approaching 500 ft. from touchdown with 1;100 ft. down on the VSI; Captain calmly said 'What do you think about a go around'? I said that sounds like a good idea your call. We did the go around according to the new procedures without event. After vectors for a downwind and base back to Runway XX and fully aware of the aircraft capabilities or lack thereof a visual approach was flown and successfully landed on Runway XX; making the high speed taxi way of X.The successful completion of the flight was made easier by the training received and the adherence to the SOP's established by company. The Captain set expectations the very first time I met him in ZZZ for the start of the sequence. These expectations along with good CRM and the experience of the Captain aided in the successful outcome of the flight. I believe that this was a computer failure in nature.",,"Kudos to Person A. For a probationary pilot to focus on what he was taught to do during training made this a non event. His CRM and flying skills made the events that unfolded seem like a normal flight with 2 FMGCs; 2 Electronic Instrument Systems (EISs) and 3 Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) failures. Despite these issues; he continued to make every altitude and airspeed restriction on the arrival. His CRM skills were timely and spot on. Recognizing we were unstable and deciding to go around showed his situational awareness.The second approach was a visual pattern with ATC assistance. The skills he obtained in training made this hand flown approach the success that it was.We were at 28;000 ft. roughly 180 miles (?) from ZZZZ. It was a beautiful VMC day. The dry riverbed's luminescence perfectly pointed us to the field the closer we proceeded to land.My first recollection was an auditory triple click noting system downgrade. Checking the Flight Management Advisory; FMA; I saw 'HEADING' displayed. We tried to push the Navigation button without success. Switching Autopilots multiple times lead to the same result. Person A was the Pilot Flying; PF; and I was the Pilot Monitoring; PM. The next item we verbalized was 'GPS' in the scratchpad of the Multi-functional Control Display Unit; MCDU. Finally the first and only Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring; ECAM; was to set the destination elevation. 'My aircraft' said the PM. I set the field elevation from my 10-9 page roughly 300 ft. and selected manual. Our next issue was 'set offside range'. From experience; I knew an FMGC had failed. We coordinated ranges all the way from top of descent to final approach segment.I looked down to see the flight plan was gone and only Present Position; PPOS was displayed. I flipped back and forth between the primary and secondary flight plans and noticed the secondary Line Select Key Right One; LSK R1; showing INIT. I typed in ZZZZ/ZZZZ and actually got a destination. Once a flight plan was built; I activated the secondary. This allowed me to go back to auto for the Cabin Pressure Controller. I verified the field elevation was good and it worked like normal.During this evolution; Person A confessed to ATC we were having navigation issues. He was getting headings and descents. We were cleared to intercept a radial but couldn't. We got some directs at this point but the plane would not allow us to manage the descent. Due to only having open descent available; we set the bottom of each restriction even though we were cleared lower. We hadn't gotten ATIS due to the distance. I obtained the current ATIS and reset the performance page. I made a simple cabin PA and did not advise the flight attendants or passengers of our situation as I felt there was no need to invoke pandemonium. The airplane was flying and operating normal with minor peculiarities that we kept dealing with. We ran the descent checklist on time. We prepared the cabin; activated the approach; did landing lights and sterile all per the FOM.ATC did an excellent job of vectors and altitudes to set us up for the VOR 2 Runway XX. It took a few times to get what we wanted but persistence paid off. Once we were cleared to intercept the VOR the airplane showed 'SPECIF VOR/D UNAVAIL'. I have never seen this display in 19 years on the Airbus. PF could not Arm the approach! We also tried to manage the speed and it would not arm. The perf page showed no approach speeds. These distractions pushed us to the high side of the VASI.Approaching 1;000 ft. we were stable but were three white one red on the VASI. Person A was trying his best to correct without exceeding 1;000 ft. per minute. Somewhere below five hundred feet I saw 1;100 down on the VASI. I calmly said; 'What do you think about a go Around'? Person A calmly replied 'Yeah; that's a good idea'. We did the Go Around according to the new procedures. Because the approach had not been armed we did not set the Missed ApproachAltitude. On the new go around procedure we caught this threat! We had practiced this on each descent brief the previous two briefs and I feel this helped slow down an already bad situation. The go around allowed is to regroup and be better prepared for the nuances of the second approach. Person A had selected 185 kts. on the go. This was actually good in that we climbed quicker and yet were ahead of the airplane. We stayed at flaps one in the pattern as we discussed the upcoming approach. We ran a descent checklist and a before landing checklist like the first approach.We landed long because we were fast due to a bugged speed verses a managed speed. We had no reference speeds so we set VLS plus 5 which is typically what I have seen. In the uniqueness of the situation we had selected medium auto brakes which I feel was significant to a successful outcome. I verbalized 'Full Reverser' to which Person A did per the SOP.Keys to our success:The day one brief helped set the tone for Person A to give inputs in the cockpit. We talked about our expectations of each other to mitigate mistakes. Procedures were written to help us get through this unique scenario.Training makes us fly a hand flown approach in the simulator. Person A showed his comfort with this when he stated 'Flight Directors off give me the bird' on final. The simulator pilots did their job well!Standardized procedures cut out any guess work between the two of us. My expectations while in the heat of the battle were met by Person A doing things the company trained way.Person A briefed the approach at 250 miles. Had we not done our briefing early; we could easily have gotten behind the plane. The familiarity with the points in the arrival and final helped us when the secondary flight plan was rebuilt and activated.This could happen again. Would love to see this scenario built for [future] training.",,"Flight Crew reported failures of numerous systems in cruise.

We started both engines and taxied to Runway XXR. All check list and engine warmup time's completed. Takeoff roll was normal. After the gear was retracted we notice number two engine oil level was low and started blinking. Shortly after we noticed the white advisory message advising us of the oil. We discussed contacting maintenance once we passed 10;000 ft. And see what they had to say. Climbing out of 4;000 ft. We received violent bangs followed by massive yawing of the aircraft indicative of an engine failure. I immediately leveled the aircraft to get more airflow into the engine. At this point the number one engine had at least 3-5 massive compressor stalls followed by a rollback. My first officer (FO); who did an amazing job; advised ATC and started the ECAM procedures. We had numerous ECAM messages going off and of course flight attendants calling us nonstop due to the flames coming out of number one engine; rightfully so. I immediately started the APU and turned back towards ZZZ. The number two engine was still low on oil so my FO and I discussed the contingency for that situation as well. Once we leveled off; I started a slow decent with reduced power on number one. The compressor stalls stopped but the engine was running hot. Once we had every checklist completed and all the proper company stations called. We decided to make an overweight landing. On final we saw all the Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) was waiting for us. After completing all normal checklists; Fight Attendant briefing; passenger announcements and abnormal checklists; we felt it was time to land. We had plenty of fuel and a lot of time to make sure things were done correctly. Our aircraft weight was around 149;900 pounds when we touched down. We stopped the aircraft in the runway and called flight attended stations. CFR looked us over and noticed our brakes were pretty hot; but did not notice any engine damage or fire on the affected side. CFR told us to shut down both engines on the runway. After inspection I called over the PA to remain seated. We started number two and taxied to the gate with CFR in tow. No further actions were taken.",,,,"A320 Captain reported compressor stalls; engine rollback; and failure of the number one engine while climbing through 4;000 ft. just after departure.

There were zero other messages or steps to take. The Captain expressed he has experience in this situation and pulled number 1 engine to idle. I then activated autopilot. The captain then ran checklists and advised ATC. We were given vectors to return to runway XX at ZZZ. The Captain then called the Flight Attendants and gave them the required information for the situation. On downwind the Captain took flight controls and transferred ATC to me. In this high workload situation we briefly considered contacting operations but decided to wait till we were on the ground. After landing and stopped I found nothing in the QRH.

We followed the Engine - Oil Bypass Light QRH. The Bypass Light went out with the Number 1 Engine at about 77% N1. The checklist says to confer with Dispatch and Maintenance about safest course of action.I sent a message to Dispatch; "Call me;" on Commercial Radio frequency. Dispatch quickly responded with a frequency; but we had to wait about 10+ minutes since another aircraft was handling a medical issue with a passenger. Once they were finally done and the frequency was clear; we were able to establish a phone patch with Dispatch and Maintenance. By this time; we were nearly over the top of ZZZ1.After explaining what happened; telling them the checklist we followed; and after having a brief discussion with Dispatch; Maintenance; and the FO (First Officer); we all agreed it was safe to continue to ZZZ2 as long as the Number 1 Engine parameters stayed within normal limits; and it did not need to be shut down. Maintenance suspected it was an instrumentation issue since we had oil pressure and oil temperature within normal limits. We all agreed it was not necessary to [request priority handling] with the Number 1 Engine operating at reduced thrust; so we did not do so at this point.I called the flight attendants to give a briefing. Person A answered. I told her; I need to give you a briefing. Her exact response was; "But; I am right in the middle of my service." I told her this was more important; and she put Person B on the phone. I had to repeat to Person B that I needed to give her a briefing; and she seemed better prepared for one - asking me to wait just a moment while she got ready to take notes on her link device.Once she was ready; I advised her that one of our engines was operating at reduced power because of an oil issue. It was still running; and we were still continuing to ZZZ2; but there was a chance we would divert with only 20+ minutes warning to the cabin if the engine performance significantly degraded. I told her we had about an hour to go; there was no need to prep for an evacuation; I had no special instructions; and I would update her if things changed.We reviewed the Engine Shutdown Checklist; kept the fuel balanced; checked the single-engine performance page of the FMC; and continued to monitor the engine. The Bypass Light reilluminated about every 3 - 5 minutes during flight and go out when the throttle was slightly reduced. Each time the N1 needed for the light to go out was a little lower. I sent a maintenance write-up and info report; logging the multiple N1 numbers when the Bypass Light came on; and what setting it went off. Per the Oil Bypass Light Checklist and our conversations with Dispatch / Maintenance; we continued towards ZZZ2. It appeared more likely that we would end up shutting down the engine; so I called the flight attendants and gave an updated briefing. I told her we were about 10 - 15 minutes of committed to continuing to ZZZ2; and to consider no news is good news on the need to divert. Fortunately; ATC needed a slower than normal speed from us; as we would not have been able to hold a fast; 0.78 mach or 300+ kt. if they needed it.We requested to descend early so the Number 1 Engine could operate at a further reduced setting. Just after the start of descent; the Oil Bypass Light came on again; and did not extinguish with the throttle at idle. The Oil Bypass checklist directed us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist. We followed the checklist; shut down the engine; advised Dispatch we were shutting down the engine; and about to [request priority handling]. After shutting down the Number 1 Engine; [requested priority handling] with ATC.After completing the checklist to the descent briefing portion; I did another briefing with the flight attendants and made a PA to the passengers. I did not have the flight attendants prepare the cabin for an evacuation - as we would be landing on a dry; long runway it did not seem necessary. In my view; "Prepare the Cabin" meant briefing the passengers on brace positions; and additional briefings with the passengers in the exit rows. Discussions with Person B after landing determined that she thought "Prepare for Evacuation" simply meant being more spring-loaded to evacuate herself; but no extra briefings of the passengers. There was obviously a big gap between what they think and what we think "Prepare for Evacuation" means in an immediate situation and this should be looked at and further addressed. I calmly told the passengers to expect a little faster than normal landing; they would see fire trucks follow us; and despite all this; we would still have them into ZZZ2 early; and I will see them at the gate. We had the checklist completed well before joining the approach to [Runway] XXL. We landed and fire / rescue confirmed there was no smoke / no evidence of abnormalities / no hot brakes before we taxied into the gate.",,"Normal ground operations and checks; with uneventful takeoff and initial departure out of ZZZ. Around XA:38; while climbing through approximately 23;000 ft. MSL for FL290 the Captain's side; Number 1 Engine Oil Bypass Light illuminated. Oil pressure was normal; RPM was normal; Number 1 Engine Oil Temperature was noted as slightly warmer - approximately N1 - 95 degrees; N2 - 77 degrees. Captain directed execution of 737 FM Non-Normal procedures. Checklist was accomplished in order; condition and light was confirmed. Autothrottle was disengaged; LNAV and VNAV remained engaged. Thrust lever was confirmed; then retarded slowly until approximately 77% N1 when the light extinguished. Light had extinguished so we proceeded. The Captain then contacted Dispatch and Maintenance after we discussed factors and positive control of the aircraft was passed to me. Dispatch and Maintenance recommendation was to continue; Captain and I used CRM / TEM (Threat and Error Management) and discussed possible threats to continuing the flight; and made the decision we concurred the flight could continue. After the Captain completed discussion with Dispatch / Maintenance he conducted a briefing with the FA (Flight Attendant) then took back control of the aircraft. Shortly after the Oil Filter Bypass Light illuminated again at approximately 77% N1; thrust was reduced to 75% N1; and the light extinguished. The decision was made to continue the flight in accordance with the current game plan while while we discussed CRM / TEM for possible engine failure and divert options. Decision point was made that prior to beginning descent into ZZZ2; an engine failure would be addressed by diverting to either ZZZ3 or ZZZ4. Once on the arrival at current altitude we would continue to ZZZ2. As we continued; the light illuminated again and another N1 reduction of approximately 2% was accomplished with the light extinguishing once again. The frequency of this trend then began to increase initial reduction to reillumination of the light was about 5 minutes between and by the time we began descent for the arrival we had decreased from 71% N1 to 68% and the light only remained off for approximately 1 - 2 minutes. By 27;000 ft. in the descent the light would illuminate again after only 30 seconds from each thrust reduction and Engine 1 Oil Temperature was noted as rising from 99 to 107 degrees Celsius as thrust was reduced all the way to idle closed. Once closed; step three of the Engine Oil Filter Bypass was conducted; following Oil Filter Bypass Light stays illuminated and Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist for the NG; 737 FM was then executed per the publication. At this time the Captain [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Center. ZZZ2 Center kept us initially on the arrival but lifted all speed restrictions and gave a hard altitude of 14;000 ft. MSL for our descent. The Captain passed controls one more time with good confirmation to allow him to update the FAs; Dispatch / Maintenance; and review the arrival brief while covering CRM / TEM threats and mitigation. Once complete; controls were passed back to the Captain. I completed the remainder of the Engine Failure or Shutdown Non-Normal procedure; then proceeded to the Once Engine Inoperative Landing Non-Normal Checklist 737 FM. At this point ZZZ2 Approach had passed us to a single channel Approach frequency with a dedicated control and cleared us for the Visual XXL per our request as as that was our expected arrival and was loaded in the system. The checklist was completed in its entirety and the approach to landing was without incident and in accordance with all procedures and very much so reflected exactly the situations and training that we receive at the training center in the simulators. Airport & Rescue Firefighting (ARFF) was able to inspect the brakes and do a general safety check once we cleared the runway and an uneventful taxi to the gate was accomplished followed by shutdown. Training; support from ATC; Approach; Tower; Dispatch; Maintenance; and ARFF was all expertly and professionally handled with no issues detracting from the safe accomplishment of the flight. Training and checklist usage and the 737 FM were excellent tools for the situation with one suggestion in regards to the FM Checklist and Fuel Balance. By short final or landing rollout my best recollection was our fuel was at an imbalance of approximately 600 lb. with about 4;200 lb. on the Engine 1 side and 3;600 lb. on the Number 2 side. Although in tolerance and not unsafe this was a larger split than intended and the Captain and I had discussed a game plan for management and monitoring. The checklist however only mentions it one time during Step 9 of FM well prior to final landing; where much time might be spent with a growing imbalance of fuel. I recommend "Balance Fuel as Needed" be added to the end of the engine failure again; prior to Step 15 on FM; and then again add "Balance Fuel as Needed" prior to deferred items on FM during the Engine Inoperative Landing Non-Normal Checklist.",,"B737 Flight Crew reported the Number 1 Engine Oil Bypass Light illuminated during the climb out. After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance; the decision was first made that the engine did not need to be shut down. However; as the flight continued to the destination and the Oil Bypass Light would not extinguish; the engine was then shut down.",

We thought that there was a fuel leak because of the rapid fuel flow out of the left tank. The First Officer (FO) continued to fly the aircraft while I ran the Engine Fuel Leak QRH. We briefly discussed continuing straight to ZZZ1 but the weather was better in ZZZ and the rate of fuel loss out of the left side was very concerning to us. While I ran the QRH the FO [requested priority handling] and requested vectors back to ZZZ. The rapid loss led us to confirm a fuel leak in the QRH which led us to shutting down the number one engine. We continued to an uneventful single engine landing in ZZZ. After securing the engine we became aware the cross feed valve was open. I know I pointed at it in the QRH and verified it closed. I did not see a dim blue light and did not expect it to be open; because the only time it is open is when I open it. While we did discuss the issue at hand before delving into the QRC we felt a great urgency to act quickly due to the very rapid loss of fuel. A longer safety pause would have been more appropriate. The FO did a great job flying the plane and handling the radios but the approach environment is very distracting.I left the checklist to get ATC SOB count after we [requested priority handling]; and again to talk to the Flight Attendants (FAs) when they felt the plane turning around. Better managing distractions during critical junctures of the checklist would have gone a long way. I feel like I have good working knowledge of the 737 fuel systems; and know that one pump can overpower the others and the high power setting and fuel flow was the reason why the draw on the left side was so alarming. In retrospect there were a number of opportunities to trap this error before becoming an undesirable aircraft state. Fatigue may have been a contributing factor as this incident occurred on daylight savings day. I had a hard time falling asleep and woke up at XA:30 AM body time. My watch estimated my sleep for the night as 4 hours 13 minutes. I was tired that day and using caffeine to get me home. I have learned a lot from previous company guidance on this issue and never wanted to be the one to go down this rabbit hole. Look out for tunnel vision; confirmation bias; don't rush!",,"Shortly after completing the after takeoff checklist the Captain noticed that fuel was depleting from the left fuel tank at an alarming rate. After a quick discussion we agreed that a fuel leak was suspected. I continued flying the aircraft and took over radio duties while the Captain ran the QRH for fuel leak. I [requested priority handling] and requested radar vectors back to ZZZ after a quick discussion with the Captain as the weather was significantly better there than ZZZ1. The checklist lead us to shut down the left engine and we prepared for a single-engine approach and landing. While on downwind our jump seater noticed that our cross feed valve was in the open position and neither the Captain nor I had caught it. We were so busy and inundated with task-saturation that a step was missed in the QRH. I think we were pretty shocked to see how fast our fuel was depleting from the left side and that caused us to rush the checklist and miss key steps. The volume of radio calls and vectors kept me from doing a great job of backing up the Captain while they ran the checklist. Fatigue was definitely a contributing factor as we had an early van in ZZZ2 on the morning of daylight savings. This is a prime example of needing to slow down and take a better assessment of the situation before rushing to conclusions.",,"B737 Flight Crew reported a suspected Fuel Leak after takeoff.

They mentioned this to me and after I looked over and began to smell a burning smell that quickly intensified. I also noticed what appeared to be some haze potentially from smoke. The Captain retained control of the aircraft and we immediately donned our oxygen masks and I began working the QRC. We then had a frequency change and I checked in [to advise ATC]. The Controller tried to change our runway to XXL but we elected to land on XXR which we had previously briefed and to avoid adding to our workload. We landed without further incident and the fumes seemed to clear.

Before we returned to ZZZ; I proceeded with the QRH procedure for Gravity Extension and it was successful. We got 3 green lights and 3 green on the ECAM with the doors open. I then contacted the FAs and informed them that we had successfully lowered the landing gear; it was safe and locked and we would be returning to ZZZ for a precautionary landing. I then made another PA to the passengers also informing them that the landing gear was safe and locked and we were returning to land. We told ATC that we were ready to return and that we would be unable to clear the runway after landing and would require a tug. We then received radar vectors to final for Runway YYC and proceeded with a normal approach and landing to a full stop on the runway. I made a PA for everyone to remain seated and that Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles were going to be inspecting the aircraft.We did after landing and engine shut down checklist. We were then informed of an extended wait for the tug so I made a PA informing the passengers and told them that they could use the lavs but I would give 5 minute notice for when they needed to be seated. After the tug arrived; Maintenance installed all gear locks and tried for about 15-20 to raise the gear doors for tow; but were unsuccessful. We were then towed to the gate and completed aircraft shutdown. I want to acknowledge the performance of FO who did an outstanding job flying the aircraft and communicating with ATC allowing me to accomplish the checklist and inform the FAs and passengers of our progress; I was also impressed with the excellent job of FAs; when informed of our situation I appreciated their prompt understanding and knowledge.",,"Upon approach to Runway XXL in ZZZ; everything was going as normal. I was the Pilot Flying and we were configuring the aircraft for landing at the FAF. I requested gear down and after the Captain lowered the gear; there was no audible indication that the gear was moving. Shortly thereafter; a Caution Message chimed that there was a landing gear disagree situation. A go-around was executed and vectors were provided by ATC. The Captain assigned me as Pilot Flying (PF) and to communicate with ATC while they performed the ECAM actions and QRH follow ups. A gravity gear extension worked perfectly. We [requested priority handling] with ATC but informed the cabin crew and passengers of a precautionary landing. The landing was uneventful except that we stopped on the runway as our nose wheel steering was INOP due to compliance with the ECAM actions. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was near the runway waiting for us and the runway was shut down while we waited for a Tow Team to pull us to the gate.After about 30 minutes of waiting on the runway; the Tow Team arrived with Airport Operations and Company Maintenance. At the request of Maintenance; I dropped the gear pins out of the cockpit. Maintenance was concerned about the gear doors rubbing the surface during the tow to the terminal and asked us to do abnormal procedures that I was confused with because of passengers still being on board. It was very clear that they were extremely concerned about the doors rubbing the surface. Everything that was done was at the direction of the Maintenance personnel who was connected to the aircraft via headset. Numerous announcements were made to the passengers by the Captain as well as communication to the Flight Attendants. We were eventually towed to the gate after being on the runway for 1 hour. Extended onboard delay procedures were complied with but not communicated to Dispatch. I will have to say that ATC; ARFF; Airport OPS; Maintenance; and the Flight Attendants all performed magnificently and I believe the passengers saw this as well.In my own words; this event was performed beautifully by everyone involved. It is because of our constant training that this actually felt like a routine event. Everyone was calm and I believe that is thanks to everyone in the Training Department. I would also like to thank the cabin crew manager for meeting us at the gate for checking on the whole crew's emotional well being. Landing Gear Issue resulting in Gravity Gear Extension; extended wait on the runway resulting in lengthy runway closure; extended wait on the runway resulting in an extended onboard delay; and abnormal non-published procedures directed by Maintenance personnel causing slight concern from flight deck crew. This event was performed beautifully by everyone involved. The 'what happens next' scenario kept playing over and over because this just doesn't happen all the time and it's not really talked about but common sense and good judgment guided us to a great outcome.",,"A319 flight crew reported the landing gear failed to extend during final approach. The flight crew executed a go around; extended gear manually; and landed at destination airport.",

I immediately took manual control of the aircraft and assessed the cause finding the left TRANSFER BUS OFF Annunciation accompanied by the Left SOURCE OFF Annunciation Illuminated. My copilot went to the QRH and we ran the TRANSFER BUS OFF checklist without success of regaining power to the associated bus. The procedure in this situation directs the pilots to land at the nearest suitable airport which in this case was our destination airport ZZZ. We [requested priority handling] and proceeded to ZZZ. The NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist was also run and the SOURCE OFF checklist was reviewed. Inside the final fix landing Runway XXL the smell of potential burning electrical became apparent. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was requested to be present on landing and the Flight Attendants were asked about the condition in the cabin where no smell was detected.The landing was uneventful and ARFF followed us to the gate as a precaution. We also directed the ground crew to stay away from the aircraft until ARFF had determined there were no hot spots within the aircraft. The Flight Attendant additionally reported after deplaning at the gate in ZZZ that earlier in the flight an oven had smelled of burning plastic and then shut off. This would have happened approximately one hour before the bus off event and was also reported to Maintenance. The crew did an excellent job of managing this mechanical event and maintaining passenger care throughout. When running the NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist I decided not to inform the Flight Attendants or the passengers of the situation as we were landing at our destination airport and no further assistance was anticipated. In hindsight I feel informing the Flight Attendants would have been prudent regardless of the fact a diversion was not required.",,,,"B737-800 Captain reported on initial descent; the Autopilot Disengaged in smooth air without warning and they could smell potential burning electrical equipment.

The descent and approach were briefed per normal procedure. The FO (First Officer) was the pilot flying; PF; Captain was pilot monitoring; PM; there was no Jumpseater or other flight deck crew members present. The pre-departure briefing included duties in case of abnormal operations or emergency - PF would continue to fly the aircraft and take the radios; PM would run any required checklists. Go-around procedures were briefed during the descent briefing. The approach was planned as a normal ZZZ ILS XXR in visual; gusty-wind conditions.At approximately XA:00 on Day 0; the flight was approaching ZZZZZ - ZZZ ILS XXR final approach fix - at approximately 1;800 ft. AGL. As briefed; the FO called for gear extension and setting Flaps 15. The gear extension sounded normal at first. However; both pilots observed abnormal landing gear position light indications. The following indications were noted: All three green landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. All three green landing gear indicator lights on the aft overhead panel were illuminated. All three red landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. A single; unfamiliar; tone - beep - sounded briefly.Unsure of what may have caused the abnormal landing gear position indications and the unfamiliar tone - neither the PM nor the PF had heard this tone before - the PM suggested a go-around from the current altitude and the PF called for the go-around and started the procedures as briefed. ATC stated; "Aircraft X; go around; runway heading; climb and maintain 3;000 ft." The first "half" - i.e.; TOGA engagement; raising flaps to 15; which we were already positioned at; checking thrust; raising gear; [and] setting missed approach altitude - of the go-around was conducted normally. At this time; ATC started calling to ask about the reason for the go-around. This interrupted the go-around procedure. Approximately 30 seconds later as the aircraft was accelerating; the remaining procedures were accomplished - heading select; level change; setting clean maneuvering speed; raising flaps to 0; After-Takeoff Checklist. Allowing the ATC interruption and subsequent delay was pilot/crew error. However; the procedures were accomplished fully and safely.After go-around procedures were accomplished and the aircraft was overflying the ZZZ field; during the field overflight; the Tower reported that the aircraft's left main gear appeared to be extended while all other gear appeared retracted. All landing gear indicators on the flight deck appeared normal; i.e.; there were no red or green gear lights illuminated. The crew had no way to confirm whether or not the left main gear was extended. ATC queried the crew as to what airspace was required to resolve the issue. The PM requested vectors to remain in the local area and ATC vectored the flight west and directed a climb to 5;000 ft. MSL. The PF engaged the autopilot and maintained 230 KIAS via the MCP (Mode Control Panel) speed window.During the vector; the PF selected VNAV instead of continuing the LVL CHG climb. This caused the aircraft to start a brief descent while it attempted to recapture the cruise altitude in the FMC. The issue was identified by the PF; who disconnected the Autopilot and set the desired pitch attitude for the climb; followed by requesting re-engagement of LVL CHG; which was accomplished by the PM. The PF then re-engaged the Autopilot.The PM started to run NG Gear Disagree Checklist. The PF coordinated vectors with ATC and confirmed altitude and heading changes with the PM. While running the checklist; the PM: Step 1 - Landing gear lever is OFF. Step 2 - Landing gear lever moved to the UP position after takeoff; go-around. Step 3 - 235 KIAS maximum; landing gear lever: UP. Step 4 - All red and green landing gear indicator lights are extinguished. End of the checklist.PMthen determined that no additional resolution was available. We as a crew discussed if we should request priority handling; but it was decided that we had time and fuel 14;400 lb. left to continue to work on the problem. So we opted not to request priority handling at that time. However; ATC then asked us souls on board and fuel remaining; so we provided them with the information of SOB and 14;400 lb. of fuel remaining; or 144 minutes of flight time available. They essentially provided priority handling for us. Since we had no indication if our left main gear was still extended or not like the ZZZ Tower had told us it was; the crew then decided to contact a Company Ground Agency for any potential assistance or information they could provide. The PM contacted Company ZZZ Operations; who then directed us to contact Company ZZZ Maintenance. The Maintenance personnel suggested cycling the Manual Gear Extension Door located behind the FO on the floor open and closed as well as check for any popped circuit breakers. No additional resolution was gained as all landing gear indicator lights were still extinguished. While the PM was communicating with Maintenance; ATC contacted the PF and suggested the flight overfly ZZZ1 Airport; where Tower personnel could examine the gear positions with binoculars. The PF agreed and accepted vectors toward ZZZ1. When the PM was available; the PF briefed the PM on the plan to have ZZZ1 personnel visually inspect the gear. The PM agreed; then briefed the Purser; and made a short announcement to the passengers.Once the PM confirmed checklist usage complete; Maintenance agreed with the plan to overfly ZZZ1 and extend the gear. The PF accepted a descent to 2;000 ft. MSL and continued toward ZZZ1. Approaching ZZZ1; the PF extended the gear with PM concurrence. The aircraft was at 230 KIAS. The gear extension appeared normal; both in sound and landing gear light indicator illumination sequence. When complete; there were three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the instrument panel; three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the aft overhead panel; and zero red landing gear indicator lights illuminated. The aircraft overflew ZZZ1 at 2;000 ft. MSL and in a right turn toward the south. Through ZZZ Approach Control; ZZZ1 Tower personnel reported that all three landing gear appeared to be down. At this time Ground / Maintenance communications were called complete.With normal gear indications on the flight deck and visual confirmation from ZZZ1 Tower; the PF and PM decided that the gear would remain down for the remainder of the flight. At this point; the crew discussed and determined the following: All applicable checklists were run. Both flight crew members were comfortable moving into the approach / landing phase. The PF would continue to fly the aircraft. Call to Purser to rebrief the flight attendants on the situation and to NOT plan for an evacuation.The PF then requested and accepted vectors for the ZZZ ILS XXR. The PM reloaded the approach into the FMC and the PF called for the descent checklist. The localizer was intercepted between ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ. The remainder of the flight; including approach; landing; and taxi-in; were uneventful. During the approach; it was apparent that ATC; most likely Tower personnel; [provided us priority handling] and made Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles available. Additionally; on short final; ZZZ Tower personnel confirmed that all three gear appeared to be down. ARFF vehicles and equipment followed us to the gate area.After parking; shutting down the aircraft and conducting a short crew-only debrief - which focused on the go-around procedures and checklist usage - the flight crew was met by two ZZZ assistant chief pilots; Person A and Person B; and one Company Maintenance Representative. The flight crew was fully debriefed by Maintenance and [other] personnel. The PF entered an electronic logbook entry to document theevent.",,,,"B737 NG Captain reported the landing gear extension and indicator lights had problems and was observed to be acting abnormally upon landing gear extension. The flight crew performed a go-around to troubleshoot and a decision was made to divert to another airport to do a fly-by for Tower to confirm landing gear position. After the landing gear was confirmed to be down; the flight crew returned to the original airport and safely landed.",

Myself and another relief pilot were the relief pilots for the segment and in occupied the cockpit jumpseats during the event. On liftoff; R DRIVE and R GEN OFF illuminated. Captain acknowledged the message and calmly stated for the student to complete a normal takeoff profile and we would address the messages on climb out - an excellent decision and use of CRM. Once safely established on climb out; Captain started the APU (experience showing here) and was in the process to address the R side generator messages via checklist but the system RESET itself and all R side messages disappeared. A few short minutes later; the L DRIVE and L GEN OFF illuminated. Captain indicated this was unusual and it was likely we may need to return to ZZZZ. We began the process coordinating a hold with ATC to allow for proper system evaluation and checklist use as well as coordination with Dispatch & Maintenance. Established in the hold; Captain used the checklist - the Left side electrical messages persisted and; as a result; the L IDG DRIVE was disconnected via checklist command. After coordination with Company; we were informed that Maintenance independently received IDG/ GEN related messages on BOTH the right side as well as the left side generator systems - though we only had left side indications persist. Again; Captain's instincts proved correct. Captain; in agreement with the Dispatcher and pilot flight crew; came to the universal decision the safest course of action was a return to ZZZZ for inspection. Next Captain coordinated with ATC to provide for fuel dumping and the fuel dump checklist was actioned and; later; the overweight landing checklist was actioned. Captain coordinated with the flight attendants and informed the passengers of the return to ZZZZ. The IOE student had decent previous experience and was able to program the FMC and manage airspeed & configuration changes showing a high level of situational awareness. Captain delegated to the both relief pilots to verify landing performance and double check the diversion guidance from the flight manual. A normal approach and landing was made into ZZZZ and all appropriate electrical maintenance write-ups were completed. Having myself been an instructor in the regional airlines; I must add the calm manner of Captain allowed the student to excel in this environment and despite multiple EICAS messages - the flight was conducted in a deliberate; methodical; and safe fashion based on the leadership of Captain - an outstanding job.",,"Right after takeoff; we had the R GEN OFF and R GEN DRIVE EICAS messages along with the associated lights on the overhead panel. Just as we were going to do the checklist procedure; the R GEN DRIVE message and light cleared. The right generator was reset by checklist procedure and continued to operate normally.A few minutes later; the L GEN OFF and L GEN DRIVE EICAS messages along with the associated lights on the overhead panel came on. Followed flight manual guidance and did the associated checklist; which disconnects the IDG. Requested clearance from ATC to proceed to a waypoint and hold while we discussed the situation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. We all agreed that the most prudent course of action would be a return to ZZZZ. Jettisoned fuel and returned for an overweight landing.

The relieved crew reported to us that the First Officer (FO) side VOR/ILS was MEL'd. They said that they had to conduct a missed approach earlier in the day at ZZZ due to a loss of all ILS indicators on both sides. The flight mechanic had run a test in ZZZ that the Captain side system passed. We prepared the aircraft for our first leg to ZZZZ1 and departed around XB55L. The Captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and First Officer (FO) PM. During the climb as we passed through FL310 we observed a steady decrease in the #1 engine EGT. This decrease continued down to zero before the display blanked out. A few seconds later; the EGT gauge began to fluctuate erratically; ranging between zero and 1250 degrees Celsius. All other engine indications remained normal. We leveled off at FL310 and executed the memory items for the engine limit; surge; or stall checklist. Even with the #1 thrust lever closed; the EGT indications continued to act erratically.We began to work through the QRH checklist and elected to halt prior to shutting the affected engine down. This was due to the problem most likely being an indication issue and our location over the ocean. At this point; the aircraft was in LNAV/VNAV without the autothrottle engaged. While attempting to troubleshoot the indication issue; the aircraft started to execute a left turn as per the active route in the FMS. This turn resulted in a rapid increase in bank to about 25 degrees; and a rapid loss in airspeed as the autopilot attempted to maintain altitude. We received a stick shaker activation. The PF disengaged the autopilot; and applied forward pressure and right aileron inputs. The aircraft was in a stable descent by FL300. The PF had the PM set a descent speed of 280 kts.We asked for an immediate return to ZZZZ; and [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center. We attempted to contact dispatch using XXX.X but could not get a response. As we got closer to ZZZZ; the PM set the aircraft up for the ILS Runway XX. We planned to do a flaps 15 landing and utilized the performance in flight section of the QRH to calculate landing distance due to the abnormal flaps condition and the overweight condition. As we were receiving vectors to the ILS; we overshot our initial intercept of the localizer to the left side of the Runway XX centerline. Initially; the localizer was alive on the Captain's side through the overshoot. We received a vector back to the localizer. At this time; we were in IMC. Once we received a re-intercept heading; we attempted to intercept and track the approach. At this point we lost ILS course and glide slope indications on the Captain's side. The PF attempted to follow the flight director and inadvertently descended a couple hundred feet below our ATC cleared altitude of 2500 ft. We were still a couple miles outside of the final approach fix. We broke out of IMC shortly after. I'm not sure of the altitude that we broke out at but it was between 2000 and 2300 ft. AGL. The aircraft was now located about 1 NM to the right of the Runway XX centerline. There was some confusion as to where exactly the airport was due to the erroneous indications of the flight director. The flight director continued to show a turn to the right. ATC queried about our position on the localizer and we requested a visual approach to Runway XX. This was approved and we made a safe landing in ZZZZ around XC10.",,,,"B737-300 First Officer reported erratic EGT indications climbing through FL310 resulted in stick shaker and rapid bank angle increase.

Normal landing; rolled to the end of the runway; where we were met by ARFF. Made a PA to reassure the passengers and taxi to the gate.The mechanical failure of the engine was the root cause of the situation. There was a startle factor. Also; some confusion was caused by the ECAM changing midstream. Distractions included ATC and the flight attendants.

The geese where unavoidable and we impacted within seconds of me calling them out. Damage to Engine #1 was apparent as the vibrations it was putting out where extremely high. And you could feel it throughout the airframe. The Captain selected the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) ALT of 4;000 feet and a decision to return to ZZZ was made as we didn't know the extend of airframe damage that had occurred. I started a decent and left turn for a downwind back to Runway XX. The Captain alerted the Flight Attendants of the situation and advised ATC. The Captain ran the overweight landing checklist. The secondary flight plan was then activated and the ILSXX was already programmed by me on the preflight so I set the airplane up for a base and intercepted the localizer coming back to ZZZ Runway XX.

Aircraft control was maintained by the Captain by tracking runway center line with good rudder and rudder trim application. Based on fire trailing the aircraft; severe damage indications and rising EGT; the left engine was secured by applying the engine fire QRC and remaining checklist. Excellent CRM throughout the aircraft occurred to handle the inflight situation and land the aircraft by visual approach to ZZZ XXL; 14 minutes later. There was a communication breakdown once on the ground where we did not have direct communication with the Fire Crew on the frequency.

The planned sequence was to return the same aircraft and crew to ZZZ after a regular scheduled ground turn in ZZZZ.The flight from ZZZ to ZZZZ was uneventful; although the flight crew observed the in the log described high flashing indication accompanied with the previously mentioned vibration values in the log. No airframe vibrations were observed. The return flight with the First Officer (FO) as pilot flying (PF); departed ZZZZ Runway XXL on a radar vectored departure with subsequent direct navigation to ZZZZZ to join the flight plan route. Climbing through approximately 26;000 ft.; the aircraft experienced suddenly moderate to high airframe vibrations occurring continuously; while the engine N2 vibration indications repeatedly and intermittently varied between normal and exceeded values. Initially no ECAM messages were displayed. After standard SOP call outs (my aircraft; etc.); we re-established the initial roles of PF (FO) and pilot monitoring (PM) (Captain); while beginning to assess the situation at hand. The Captain contacted ATC and requested to maintain current altitude due to technical problem and we leveled off slightly above 27;000 ft.By now the ECAM message ENG 1 HIGH VIBRATION was displayed intermittently; upon which the Captain informed ATC about our intentions to return to ZZZZ [requesting priority handling] and requesting initial radar vectors; descent clearance and Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) assistance upon arrival. We received a southerly heading and an initial descent to 20;000 ft.During the situational assessment; multiple calls were received from ATC and cabin who were understandably seeking information; which slowed us down slightly.My focus was on flying the aircraft; initiating descent; and reducing air speed to 250 kts. to minimize airframe vibration and managing time. The highest vibration value noticed by me as PF was 9.8 Units.A few seconds later with the ENG 1 HIGH VIBRATION now being displayed continuously; we performed the ECAM actions for high vibration. As I moved the #1 thrust lever towards Idle; the ECAM changed to ENG 1 FAIL. Following standard communication protocols; the Captain performed the ECAM actions; leading to shutting down the #1 Engine and starting the APU. We agreed not to attempt a restart of the failed engine. The Captain continued with the QRH follow up items and managing communication with Dispatch; Cabin; and ATC; while I continued as PF and setup the aircraft for a VOR Runway XXL/Flap 3 approach to ZZZZ. With the QRH follow up items complete; Dispatch informed via ACARS 7700; flight attendants and passengers briefed and cleared by ATC directly to the IAF for the VORXXL; we switched PF/PM roles for landing; with the Captain now PF asking me to double-check the QRH follow up items for After Engine Shutdown.Following a quick approach briefing; an uneventful; well flown single engine approach and landing on Runway XXL (approximately 2;500 pounds over maximum landing weight/offset runway) under VFR conditions was performed. Subsequent normal taxi to the gate under ARFF supervision was also uneventful.

Proceeding Southwest of ZZZ1 waypoint; we noticed a gap between the buildups in that area and started a shallow turn to the left to get back on ZZZZZ 4E arrival. At this point we have received instructions from ZZZ arrival control to proceed direct to ZZZZZ1 waypoint. Selecting direct to ZZZZZ1 intersection created projected course line that coincided with the gap between the buildups.

Prior to push back we discussed the procedures for an APU on take-off as it is a supplementary procedure in the AOM. We were cleared for take-off on XXL ZZZ. Shortly after lift-off and prior to gear up selection I noticed a couple of blurs outside my window pass beneath the aircraft; passing right to left. Immediately thereafter we heard several thuds and immediate vibration that seemed to be coming from the vicinity of the radome and/or the nose gear. After a brief consultation with the Captain; we elected to hold off gear up selection as gear integrity was in doubt and climb performance was satisfactory. No ECAMS. Upon thrust reduction; altitude CLB thrust was selected and flaps one selected and speed intervention of 200 kts. A bird strike was reported to Tower and we were switched over to Departure. Noise from the gear down and the vibration was incredibly loud and made communication very difficult even with headsets on. We advised ATC and asked to return to the airport. ATC told us to expect XXC and asked for souls on board as well as fuel load. We still suspected issues with our gear and possible radome damage so we requested a low approach so ATC could inspect gear/aircraft for abnormalities. The Captain continued to fly and I set up the FMGC for an ILS XXC and entered relevant data into the approach page. Passengers and Flight Attendants (FAs) were briefed as to our situation and intentions. During downwind we received an ECAM for ENG 1 FIRE DET LOOP B. No ECAM action items. The only anomaly on the Engine Warning Display (EWD) for ENG 1 was High N1 Vibrations. The Captain reduced thrust on the number one engine and did not see any appreciable reduction - we assumed we had cowling damage not necessarily engine damage. We performed the low approach on XXC between 1200 ft. and 1000 ft. Tower reported no anomalies seen through binoculars from the Tower and gave us positive confirmation that we had hit some mallard ducks on take-off. We climbed out to 3000 ft. and then requested a long downwind vector to return to land in ZZZ. Complicating our situation was a squall line incoming to ZZZ that would have complicated extended holding. That coupled with increased turbulence/high winds and the continued high vibration/noise we decided to make a return earlier rather than later.	During the second downwind we got HYD G RSV LO LVL. ECAM actions were run and this required turning off the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) as well as the G ENG 1 pump. A subsequent ELEC GEN 1 Fault led us to turn off the left gen. We still had the APU running from the take-off configuration and since we had elected to keep it running all busses were powered. Some more spurious ECAMs came up causing distractions; Fire DET Faults and HYD. I don't remember the exact ones. No ECAM actions associated with them. I set up the FMGC for another ILS to XXC and performed a non-normal landing distance assessment. I came up with approx 8500 ft. and XXC has an LDA of 10500 ft. I then ran the overweight landing checklist and it was agreed that we would do the approach with CONFIG 3 rather than FULL as without the system we were going to have issues if the gear was raised on a go-around. I should have redone the landing assessment as the change in configuration would have changed the assessment to approx 9500 ft. I think at this point we both thought XXL was still closed for inspection and never thought to ask if the longer runway was available. We reviewed the status page and the list of inoperative items. The Captain asked me to have the QRH handy in case of the need for an evacuation checklist after landing. We communicated to ATC that due to the loss of hydraulics we were unsure of our ability to taxi (steer) off the runway after landing and indicated it would be a full stop landing. A descent and before landing checklist was actioned. We executed the ILS landing and I gave the Captain continuous descent rates through 500 ft. as due to weight we were descending on the glide at around 900 ft/minute. Touchdown occurred with less than 300 ft/minute indicated. We brought the airplane to a full stop abeam taxiway. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles were present and we asked them to inspect both engines; wing surfaces and brakes for signs of damage/fire. The left wheel assembly was over 500 degrees celsius and brake fans were selected on. ARFF indicated some damage to ENG 1 and possibly some wing damage but brakes and landing gear looked fine. Due to damage to engine 1 we elected to shut down both engines and request a tow off. We left spoilers and flaps in their landing configuration as we felt retracting them might cause further damage. Due to the relative urgency to get the airplane back on the ground we never ran the non-normal landing procedures from the pages nor any ECAM follow ups but all relevant details and briefings that stem from that were discussed and actioned as best as possible. There was obviously a lot of pressure/stress for us to get the airplane back down quickly and not to do extended troubleshooting or extra follow up checklists. As a result we never got the chance to formally notify the company. But FAs/passengers/ATC were all fully aware of our situation and intentions. High noise and vibration made communication very difficult. Coupled with rapidly approaching poor weather we elected to get the airplane on the ground quickly. This time pressure did not allow us to run all available follow up procedures from the pages. However; I think all big picture procedures were completed satisfactorily and taking extra time to do 'tidy-up' work would have decreased safety margins rather than enhance them. Bird strike the root cause.",,"Our flight departed ZZZ at night on Runway XXL. We planned a TOGA take-off with APU on config 2. We encountered large multiple bird strikes just after rotation. Both the First Officer (FO) and I saw them just under the nose of the aircraft. We felt big thuds and started feeling some aircraft vibration. I decided to keep the gear down as both the First Officer and I suspected we had potential damage to the nose gear/strut assembly. I instructed the FO to advise ATC and request a return to the field. I wanted to minimize flap configuration changes and keep the landing gear down and I made a decision to stay at approximately 200 kts. with the gear down and fly with flaps 1. First ECAM we became aware of was an eng 1 fire detection B loop fault. Engine vibration on the left side was over 9 units. Right side was normal. Suspected engine cowl damage at this time. On downwind I tried reducing thrust on #1 engine to see if the vibration would disappear but it didn't seem to affect it so I decided to keep the engine running at normal power as it was producing usable thrust with us at max weight and the landing gear down. We were unsure at this time if both engines were affected. Once we were established on downwind I made a quick interphone call to Flight Attendants (FAs) to give them a brief on our situation and told them to prepare the cabin for a landing in approximately 10 minutes with a possibly low flyby first. I then briefed the passengers telling them what happened and what to expect on our return to the field. I told them for now we expect a normal landing and there would be safety vehicles standing by. It was very hard to converse with my FO even with headsets on interphone and volume full as noise with the gear down and aircraft vibration was extremely loud. I decided to do a flyby to have Tower check gear. Did that at 1200 ft. then 1000 ft. MSL. Tower inspected us with binoculars and said landing gear appeared intact. With that information I decided to climb back up to 3000 ft. and come around for a landing. At some point on downwind we experienced a HYD G Reservoir Low Level ECAM in addition to a GEN 1 fault. With the heavy aircraft vibration and at near max take-off weight I decided we needed to accomplish the important items and land. I told the FO to complete the ECAMs; checklists while I flew and handle the radios. The pumps were turned off by the First Officer as part of the checklist as well as the ENG 1 generator and Power Transfer Unit (PTU). At this time we still suspected possible damage to the nose landing gear with a possible glancing blow at the left engine cowling - possibly flapping in the air stream. We really didn't know for sure what was affected at this time. I made another call to all FAs and told them that we were going to land soon and asked how things were going in the cabin. I did one more brief PA to the passengers telling them we were coming back to land and again I expected the landing to be normal. On the second downwind we started getting light to occasional moderate turbulence from approaching squall line and it appeared to the West on our weather radar. My FO and I discussed our overweight condition and I asked the FO to brief me on all the items affected by the loss of the hydraulic system and anything else pertinent for the landing. I told Approach that in the event of a missed approach I would fly straight out to 3000 ft. The FO read the checklist and told me a config 3 landing was preferred with loss of hydraulics. I was also concerned about our severe overweight condition and possibly losing the #1 engine and having to do a potential go-around. We were over max weight with no auto brakes and alternate braking. Our landing speed was calculated at 161. However I bumped the approach 3 kts. up to 164 because of aircraft vibration for a buffer. My FO did a very quick landing calculation with the hydraulics inop and determined the landing distance available was approximately 8500 ft. with a landing distance available of 10540 ft. on Runway XXC. Upon a normal landing I remained stopped on the runway approximately near the taxiway while safety vehicles inspected our airplane. I instructed the passengers to remain in their seats after coming to a full stop. After everything was determined secure by safety personnel we asked Company for a tow tug to tow us into the gate and have Company meet the passengers. We were towed into the gate and the passengers deplaned. I wrote up in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML) the associated mechanical issues and the bird strike.",,"A321 flight crew reported multiple bird strikes on take-off and subsequent ECAM messages indicating nacelle and cowl damage to the #1 engine.

We responded to the systems failure per SOP. Conducting the ECAM actions through the end of the status page review. Before I could accomplish the QRH follow-up and climbing toward 20;000 feet. MSL; a Flight Attendant (FA) called to report a loud grinding noise in the back of the aircraft. I told FA that it was probably associated with the hydraulic system failure and that I would call back. At that moment; the continuous repetitive chime sounded.The autopilot disconnected; we were presented with a red AUTO FLT AP OFF; RED HYD G+Y SYS LO PR; and a RED LAND ASAP on the upper ECAM. An Amber HYD Y RSVR OVHT; an Amber HYD Y SYS LO PR; and an Amber F/CTL ALTN LAW also appeared.I directed the First Officer (FO) to [request priority handling] and to get us a landing on the longest runway at ZZZ and discarded pursuit of the follow-up for the system failure to work the more severe problem now presented to us by the ECAM. The ECAM directed Power Transfer Unit (PTU) OFF and AFFECTED PUMPS OFF. It then directed: 'If Yellow SYS Lost by ENG 2 PUMP LO PR:YELLOW ELEC PUMP ON.' Not knowing for sure whether the system hydraulic failure was caused by a leak or by the engine 2 pump; I decided not to activate the electric pump at this time. The airplane was flying and controllable. FO was descending us toward ZZZ. My goal was to work the ECAM top to bottom and slow down the situation. I accomplished windows 1 through 4 for the ECAM and sent an ACARS message for the divert to ZZZ; including 'G + Y HYD SYS FAIL' in the text.I then made an all-call to the FAs and advised them that we would be making a precautionary landing at ZZZ in about XX minutes because two of our three hydraulic pumps had failed. I told them that the aircraft was controllable and asked if there were any additional symptoms in the back such as grinding or noise. They said that the grinding had gone away. I also asked them if they had any questions and advised that I would make a PA. My PA to the passengers advised that a failure of redundant systems would require us to divert and land at ZZZ. Apologizing for the inconvenience; I told them that we would be landing in approximately XX minutes; to follow Flight Attendant instructions; and that safety equipment would be present on both sides of the aircraft after we landed.FO was doing superbly. They were simultaneously hand-flying the aircraft; working with ZZZ Center; and setting up the FMS for the approach at ZZZ. They kept the speed under control; coordinated the approach to ZZZ Runway XXR; and; because the aircraft was in alternate law; decided not to use speed brakes in the descent--all excellent judgment calls. I turned my attention to the landing distance problem. FO was entering data into the performance approach page; and I asked them to leave the configuration in flaps full so that I could use that number for the land approach. 126 is what was the annunciated Vapp. The ECAM procedure calls for a flaps 3 approach. Using a G + Y hydraulic failure; the land app yielded a Vapp speed of 151 kts. and 9;517 feet on ZZZ Runway XXR which is 11;500 feet long.In the descent in the vicinity of 10;000 feet MSL; FO reminded me that I had not turned on the Yellow Electric HYD pump (previous judgment). I reviewed the verbiage about ENG PUMP LO PR; looked at the hydraulic page again; and turned the Yellow Electric Pump ON. This restored the Yellow Hydraulic System. The aircraft returned to normal with Blue and Yellow Systems providing power to the flight controls. Not wanting to backtrack through ECAM procedures or delay landing any further; I decided to keep the Vapp speed and landing distance that I had calculated for the dual (green + yellow) hydraulic system failure rather than recalculate for what was now a single (green) hydraulic system failure.The status page required landing gear gravity extension and annunciated that landing gear retract and nose wheel steering would be inoperative.I contacted ZZZ operations to advise them that we would need to be towed from the runway and that they would need to come up with a plan for deplaning the passengers; either by air stairs on the runway or a tow to the gate. We descended to 4;000 MSL. As I reviewed the landing gear gravity extension procedure in the QRH; FO sensed that I needed additional time and requested the ZZZ Approach to vector us across the localizer; which was helpful. We then turned in to intercept the final course. I resumed communications duties. We ran the descent checklist; ensured that the performance approach page was set for the flaps 3 approach; ensured that the GPWS flaps 3 button was depressed; and configured to flaps 3 per the QRH checklist. FO called for the gear; and I performed the landing gear gravity extension procedure. The procedure was uneventful. We completed the before landing checklist and agreed that the go-around would be a gear down; flaps 3; go-around straight out to 3;000 MSL.I reconfirmed with Tower and fire command that we would be stopping the aircraft on the runway; would be unable to taxi; and need to be towed to the gate. FO flew the approach flawlessly; landing on ZZZ XXR at XA:59 PM on center line and well within the touchdown zone; bringing the aircraft to a stop on the runway just short of taxiway intersection in about 7;500 feet of rollout. Note; lack of nose wheel steering caused slight nose wheel castering as the aircraft slowed through about 5-10 kts; but FO handled it nicely. I asked FO to set the parking brake and start the APU; called the flight attendants to let them know that we would remain where we were on the runway; and made a PA to the passengers reminding them of the safety equipment around the aircraft and to follow FA instructions. I also let them know that we would remain on the runway because the aircraft was unable to taxi.FO noted later that the parking brake is difficult to set when the landing gear crank handle is pulled up. We stowed the handle. I then asked the fire command to approach both left and right sides of the aircraft to check for heat and/or fluid leaks. They then asked us to shut the engines down so that they could approach the aircraft. Fire command chalked the nose wheel. With APU running; we complied with the engine shutdown. They discovered significant fluid leaking from the right main wheel well and asked us to depressurize the hydraulic system. I secured the yellow electric hydraulic pump. My decision not to engage the yellow electric pump as part of the G + Y ECAM procedure was a result of the 'fog of war.' In retrospect; I should have turned on the yellow electric pump sooner; but good CRM and effective trapping of threats and errors got us to the right end state before landing.My decision not to recalculate landing distance and Vapp was based on knowing that the numbers we had were conservative. We had plenty of runway. I did not want to make another orbit and delay landing any further. This was a sound decision. The call from the flight attendants and my technique of completing the entire ECAM action procedure (down to the status page) prevented me from getting to the QRH follow-up on the initial green system failure. In retrospect; I would still answer the call from the FAs because they provide a window to airplane status that could be vital information to the flight deck crew. But had I accomplished the QRH follow-up for the green system failure prior to reviewing the status page; it would have advised that because the PTU had activated to power the green hydraulic system from the operating yellow hydraulic system; it might overheat. It directs to ignore the overheating yellow system and the associated dual failure procedures and to turn off the PTU and keep the yellow engine pump on. This would have prevented the perceived dual system G+Y failure.Airbus should change the ECAM procedure and incorporate the follow ups into the ECAM page so that the crew can get to them sooner. The PTU overheated the yellow hydraulic system after approximately x minutes. As rapidly as the yellow system failure occurred; I recommend making the very simple and very short QRH follow up procedures part of the ECAM procedure to prevent the second failure. Alternatively; recommend making it standard to review the status page in window 4 after completing QRH follow-ups rather than an option. Getting to the follow up procedure sooner (after window 3) in our case might have prevented the second (yellow system) failure from occurring.",,"I was Pilot flying (PF) on Aircraft X; ZZZ1-ZZZ2. Climbing on the ZZZZZ1 out of ZZZ1 at approximately 15;000 feet approaching ZZZZZ we received a brief master caution that initially went away but very quickly came back. The master caution was HYD G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR. The Captain (CA) assigned me to continue flying and work the radios. We ran through all ECAM actions; systems; and status page. Continuing our climb above 20;000 feet we received a call from the Flight Attendants (FAs). After the brief call the CA reported they were hearing a grinding noise. As the CA told me that we received a master warning and 5 new ECAM messages. A red AUTO FLT AP OFF; red HYD G+Y SYS LO PR; amber HYD Y RSVR OVHT; amber HYD Y SYS LO PR; and an amber F/CTL ALTN LAW; as well as a red LAND ASAP in the upper right window.The CA immediately told me to continue flying; [request priority handling]; and divert us to ZZZ on their longest runway. We ran through the ECAM actions again and the CA decided that they were going to hold off on turning on the Y ELEC PUMP. The plane was flying just fine and since we were in ALTN LAW and the status page said maneuver with care I elected to not use speed brakes and initially let us down slow and smooth. ATC offered us XXR at ZZZ which was perfect and I started setting up the FMS for the approach. The CA was running all of our required performance and landing distance data as well as coordinating with Dispatch; the FAs; and ops in ZZZ as we entered the low teens I brought back to their attention that we were still holding off on the Y ELEC PUMP. They reevaluated the ECAM and system page and decided that we would turn on the pump. We got the yellow system back and returned to normal law.I continued hand flying; deciding that one; the plane was flying great to that point; and two; if this was a more extensive leak rather than just a pump failure I'd have the aircraft in my hand in the event we lost the yellow system again. At this point ZZZ Approach had us ready to turn on final. I had them give us another vector to give us time. The CA elected not to restart the entire ECAM procedure and non-normal calculations given where we were lower to the ground and closer to the airport. Worst case scenario with the dual failure calculated we still had plenty of runway and that was the more conservative option and I agreed. As directed by the status page the CA gravity extended the gear and landed flaps 3 per our original calculations. The approach and landing were without surprises and we landed on XXR and stopped on center line. I set the parking brake with a little difficulty due to the manual extension handle being deployed.Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) responded and checked the aircraft. We started the APU and shut down both engines so the team could get a closer look. They reported a hydraulic leak in the right main well and asked us to turn off all hydraulic pumps still running. The CA made sure the plane was chalked and we made sure all pumps were off. Having the option to either do the follow up procedures after the ECAM page or after the completion of all ECAM procedures through the status page led to us being delayed in getting to the follow up that could have mitigated the second failure we had. Then once we had the second failure that leads us away from the follow up to the first failure which could have helped or provided insight. If the follow up procedure could somehow be integrated into the status page for a given ECAM action. Or making it standard to review all follow ups prior to reviewing the status page. This might be an isolated instance but getting to the follow up sooner might have mitigated the second failure down the road that we experienced that muddied the waters.",,"A319 Flight Crew reported a HYD G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR message annunciated during climb out; followed by multiple other associated warnings.

ECAM actions were followed and after completion; the ECAM HYD Y ENG 2 PUMP LO PR appeared due to turning off the Eng 2 Pump as directed by the first ECAM. After completing the ECAM; Dispatch was contacted and Maintenance Control was patched in. After consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and discussion amongst fellow crew members; the decision was made to return to ZZZ. [Priority handling was requested]. While in the turn the flight attendants were called and given a briefing. Shortly after; a PA was made to the passengers briefly explaining the situation and that we would be returning to ZZZ. As the ride was smooth; the FAs (Flight Attendant) were permitted to finish the service that they had already started in order to give a sense of normalcy and calmness in the cabin. Once the 180-[turn] was completed; ATC provided a route direct to ZZZ where we advised that we would require Runway XXR for landing due to its length. After making the turn back to ZZZ; we realized that the aircraft would be overweight upon landing so a descent to FL240 was requested from and granted by ATC. This was due to attempting to burn as much fuel as possible to be as close as possible to maximum landing weight upon arrival. The Overweight Landing Checklist was completed while still in cruise back to ZZZ. Landing distance was calculated by both Dispatch and myself and the values came to within approximately 200 ft. of each other at around 8;500 ft. This gross error check satisfied us that the calculations were accurate.While in cruise back to ZZZ; discussions were had regarding status page notes and stopping technique. It was noticed during discussion of status page notes that the ECAM had the crew turn on the electric yellow hydraulic pump during the approach phase while neither of the non-normal checklists in the FM (Flight Manual) contained that procedure. As the accumulator pressure was dropping slowly and the concern of losing any remaining fluid existed; the decision was made to follow the status notes in the FM non-normals section and not turn on the yellow electric pump during approach. A normal approach briefing then took place. Once the aircraft neared ZZZ; ATC provided vectors overhead for a right downwind to [Runway] XXR. The aircraft was configured early due to flap movement being slow and the desire to have extra altitude in the event another malfunction occurred. We were then vectored for approximately a 15-mile final where a visual approach was conducted. The autopilot was selected off at approximately the FAF to get a feel of how the aircraft would handle while having the yellow hydraulic system inoperative. A normal landing was made and the aircraft exited at Taxiway XX. After exiting the runway the aircraft was stopped and emergency vehicles surveyed the aircraft. Ground personnel advised that there was no evidence of hydraulic fluid on the aircraft. Emergency vehicles then cleared and the aircraft was taxied to the ramp where the engines were shut down and a tow-in was made to the final parking spot.Prior to the tow-in; the yellow electric pump was turned on momentarily to charge the accumulator in order to set the parking brake prior to shutting down engines and completing as much of a normal procedure as possible. After turning on the yellow electric pump; the hydraulic SD page was referenced and we noticed that the fluid quantity had dropped slightly. This led me to believe that if the pump was turned on according to the ECAM status notes during the approach phase and not left off according to the FM non-normal status notes; that all remaining fluid would have been lost. After shutting down the engines and waiting for the Tow Team to connect to the aircraft; it was discovered that the Tow Team did not have a headset available to communicate to the cockpit with. Instead; the busy Ramp frequency was used to communicate with the Tow Team; which led to confusion and a slight delay in getting the aircraft to the gate. After completion of the parking checklist; appropriate maintenance write-ups were made and debriefings took place with the crew; Operations Control Flight Operations Representative; and Chief Pilot.",,,,"A319 Captain reported that the ECAM HYD Y RSVR LO LVL appeared while in cruise.

After takeoff from Runway XXR in ZZZ; First Officer (FO) requested gear up and I noticed the ANTI SKID INOP light illuminated. Once the after takeoff checklist was called and the gear handle was placed to the off position; the anti-skid light extinguished. At cruise; the auto brakes were selected to 1; 2; and 3 to check for proper operation due to previous write ups and the AUTO BRAKE DISARM light illuminated and did not go away. Previous write-ups from today and Day 0 confirmed that this was a chronic issue with the auto brakes but did not reference the anti-skid system being inop. The previous write up from today also referenced a transducer #2 fault.The QRH was referenced regarding both ANTI SKID INOP and AUTO BRAKE DISARM. With the possibility of another transducer fault or a possible ANTI SKID failure; as a crew we discussed our options with an ANTI SKID failure and felt continuing to ZZZ was okay with good weather; long runways and a lighter weight and speed on landing.Dispatch and Maintenance Control were contacted to discuss the possibility of an anti skid system failure. Maintenance Control agreed with the Captain that there is a distinct possibility that the anti skid system is not working given the recent history of write ups along with the ANTI SKID INOP light illuminating now. We decided the ANTI SKID INOP QRH took precedent over the AUTO BRAKE DISARM QRH and planned for the possibility of an ANTI SKID INOP with no auto brakes on landing. My additional thoughts were that if the gear handle was placed to the down position on arrival and the ANTI SKID INOP light returned; we would be prepared. Further; with the two previous write ups including a transducer fault; it was a distinct possibility that the anti skid system was INOP.With the possibility of hot brakes; blown tires and a loss of directional control after landing without anti skid; it was decided that we would [request priority handling]; continue to ZZZ and request to land on the longest Runway XX in ZZZ. The flight attendants including Purser Person A were then brought into the loop and were given information and a briefing. At this point we had 90 minutes until landing and we discussed that we would prepare the cabin for a [priority] landing and possible evacuation when we had 45 minutes prior to landing.At 45 minutes prior to landing; I made a PA to the passengers explaining the mechanical issue we were experiencing and that the flight attendants would be preparing the cabin for a [priority] landing in addition to assuring them that we fully expected this landing to be normal but we are going to prepare for a [priority] landing as a precaution.FO and I reviewed the ANTI SKID INOP QRH and performed a thorough threat briefing to include a flaps 40 landing; the non-normal landing distance chart; an early stable approach; Captain PA announcements; touching down in the touchdown zone; manual speed brake deployment; use of max reverse thrust longer than normal; braking according to the QRH and the possibility of blown tires and directional control issues if the main wheels lock up. FO did a great job managing the threats; slowed and became stable early for the approach. At 500 ft. and approximately 30 seconds prior to landing; I made the PA; brace; brace; brace. FO flew a stable descent and touched down on center line and in the touch down zone where I manually deployed the speed brakes. Maximum reverse thrust was selected; and light steady braking was used after the nose wheel touched down. I assumed command of the aircraft at about 80 kts. and kept maximum reverse thrust in until around 40-50 kts. We vacated the Runway at XX and taxied on to X where the PA; remain seated; remain seated was made. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) responders met the aircraft and confirmed all looks normal and would follow us to the gate and check the brake temps after we parked. Brake temps were confirmed all normal after parking.The entire crew did an outstanding job preparing and executing on this situation. In the end we were able to manage the threats properly; execute a safe operation by minimizing any errors and prepared for the possibility of a non-normal landing according to our training.After we parked; Maintenance reviewed the faults and again came up with a transducer #2 fault. They assured me anti skid was indeed operative and decided to MEL the auto brake system for our next flight from ZZZ-ZZZ2 without any lengthy investigative work on the ANTI SKID INOP issues. I agreed to take the aircraft with the auto brakes MELed. On the next flight; once again the ANTI SKID INOP light was extinguished on departure but illuminated again when the gear was requested up and extinguished when the gear handle was placed to off. On this flight we suspected the anti skid was working after the assurance from ZZZ Maintenance and continued with the AUTO BRAKE DISARM MEL. Landing in ZZZ2 was uneventful. However; I believe this aircraft needs a more thorough review for ANTI SKID INOP issues given the two write ups today for ANTI SKID INOP light illuminating after takeoff.Finally; the FOM was referenced for required reports but we never did call the Chief Pilot before continuing our next flight from ZZZ to ZZZ2 due to time.

Storms had passed thru earlier and had left behind clouds; a little wind; and icing conditions on arrival. Wing & engine anti-ice were on. Flying through a cloud layer we both noticed a substance on the front windows. I thought at first it was the clouds and the low visibility associated with it. But the FO stated 'what's on the windows?' We were at approximately 10;000 ft. MSL at this time and stabilized on the RNAV approach path. We were cleared for the approach and the FO could not get the aircraft to slow down. He attempted to go to vertical speed zero and we set the speed at 180 kts. but twice the power advanced for what appeared to be no reason. I suggested we put the gear down - we were at approximately 230-240 kts. Putting the gear down did not help. We now were pretty high for the approach so I asked Tower for an S-turn. He gave us a climb to 9;000 ft. - the controller never stated the word 'go-around' but in essence that was what he was giving us. The FO advanced the power to TOGA and stated such and I stated 'TOGA set' then he went to climb and since we never had the flaps out we went straight to the gear and brought them up. Since the Autopilot was off at the time; the FO started the go-around manually and as I was talking with ATC and slightly heads down reloading the approach the FO stated at least once that he could not get the Autopilot back on. I heard him say a few minutes later that he got it back on. We requested and received the ILS XXL. Came around and flew the aircraft normally to a normal landing. The entire time this film was caked on the front windows. The side windows were clear. We could make out the runway but it was blurry. Landed normally and as I taxied off the runway I realized that the windows were slightly obscuring my view to taxi. This was in daylight hours - had it been at night I am not sure I could have taxied to the gate. Upon arriving at the gate and shutting the engines down; I opened my window and reached my hand out to touch whatever it was on the window. I had tried airborne once to use the wipers but they did not help. The best way I can describe the substance is a white powdery substance that would not come off on my hands but was caked onto the window. I felt the nose of the aircraft and I could feel it on there as well. The aircraft was staying the night in ZZZ so the FO was required to walk-around. I waited until he walked around and he came back and said he did not see anything unusual. I called Maintenance and explained to them what we had - I told him I wasn't even sure how to write this up. He agreed with me that this was a highly unusual thing. The next morning I noticed the aircraft had been very delayed leaving ZZZ and we were scheduled to leave at the gate next to the aircraft. I also noticed in the on-line maintenance log that they had stated that 'due to a sand storm they found the AOA was not moving freely'. Upon arriving at the airport the agent told me that they flew in 6 mechanics on a private jet for that aircraft. When I was doing the walk-around I noticed them and went over and talked with them in detail to give them more of the story. They said the windows had been cleaned by the time they got there but there was still some residue and some on the aircraft itself. They also did not know what it was but were performing a complete flush of the system. The aircraft is back in service now.I am not sure what that substance was nor if it affected the aircraft in a way that made it impossible for us to slow it down. Never seen anything like it. Maybe the act of the go-around put everything 'back in order'??? Just thought some sort of report other than writing it up in the logbook and talking in detail with maintenance should be sent.

Before the Systems Failed; we had a CAT 3 Dual ECAM Message. While we were looking into the reason for this both FMGCs failed which resulted in the Autopilot Disconnecting. We were able to use the backup NAV and use VOR navigation but due to lack of Autopilot we couldn't remain in RVSM Airspace. When I queried the Dispatcher about fuel burn to ZZZ1 he stated that we would land with 7.3. We found this odd because our original release had us landing with 7.0 and a cruise of FL350.

Broke off approach. Conducted ECAM and QRH; setting up for flaps 3; slats between 0 and 1; Vref plus 25 landing. Briefed; [priority handling requested]. Normal landing ZZZ XXL. On Day 0; ZZZZ-ZZZ; Aircraft X (A321 Neo). Captain (CA) is Pilot flying (PF); First Officer (FO) is PM. Normal departure; cruise and descent from ZZZZ to ZZZ. On approach to ILS XXR; PF called for flaps 1. At which point an ECAM F/CTRL SLATS FAULT was received. Slats indicated amber at position zero. Per ECAM; PM recycled flaps back to zero; then back to flaps 1. ECAM reappeared. PM notified Approach Control we needed to break off approach and work system fault. ZZZ Approach complied with giving delaying vectors at 3000 ft. assigned altitude. PF (CA) then transferred controls to the PM (FO) to begin the non-normal procedure. (PF now FO - PM now CA) CA also assigned radio duties to FO during the non-normal. PM (CA) completed the ECAM; then completed QRH using standard procedures. Noticed fuel was approximately 7.9; which led to a sense of urgency. QRH landing distance was determined to be 8;340 ft. According to previously determined landing numbers; ZZZ XXR available runway landing distance was 8486 ft. CA determined that was too close and determined Runway XXL (11;248 ft.) was more suitable. ILS XXL was loaded in the FMS with appropriate QRH directed speed changes. Although QRH directed landing distance was referenced and determined to be controlling; landing distances from ACARS were still obtained. Attempted to notify ZZZ base operations via VHF radio with no contact. (Possibility due to slant range distance to ZZZ?) Sent abbreviated ACARS message to Operations Control. Selected EMER CALL P/B for in-flight notification. Notified in-flight crew as to the situation; and briefed in-flight crew as to highlights. (Flight control slats stuck - what that meant to aircraft control on approach/landing. Estimated landing in 5 to 10 minutes. Expected normal landing. Fire trucks would be on the side of the runway). Then confirmed with each in-flight individually if they had any questions. Once in-flight complete; returned focus to landing. Side note - CA did not make the PA announcement nor did CA not request in-flight to make an announcement to the passengers. CA did not make the PA announcement as they overheard the #1 in-flight made a PA announcement and heard the word 'emergency' used. They did not hear the entire announcement.Aircraft control was passed back to the CA; (CA now PF - FO now PM). [Priority handling requested] with ATC; requested Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) to be standing-by at the side of the runway. Requested ILS XXL and ready to commence approach. Received ATC vectors to join ILS XXL outside of ZZZZZ at 2;000 feet; cleared ILS XXL approach. The PM pointed out the aircraft was in alternate law. Discussions as to when the aircraft was going to direct law. Determined to delay landing gear and deselection of auto-pilot until later than normal on the approach. CA reviewed out-loud with FO all tasks and what was the status of each task to ensure all obvious tasks were completed to the best of our ability. FO agreed all was complete. Once on approach; landing gear was lowered at approximately 1500 ft. AGL; landing checklist completed; 1;000 stable call completed. Auto-pilot was deselected at approximately 700 feet. Aircraft reverted to direct law. Normal landing and roll-out. Cleared the runway; stopped; and requested CFR to confirm tire/brake temperatures. CFR determined temperatures within limits. CA then made an announcement to passengers regarding the event; all is well and taxied to gate. After the landing checklist was completed with the exception of flaps were left at flaps 3. CFR followed/paced the aircraft all the way to the gate. CFR reevaluated brake temperatures once at the gate. Brake temperatures were within limits; CFR was cleared off with a thank you. Maintenance met aircraft atthe gate. Debrief with the entire crew was conducted once all passengers were off aircraft in jet way to due vomit smell in front of aircraft.

I immediately rotated the aircraft at Vr; dismissing the delayed rotation for the wind shear profile; since the aircraft was accelerating rapidly and consistently. The vibration stopped once airborne. At the time it seemed apparent that the nose gear or nose wheels were causing the vibration; however upon further assessment I was not sure which gear or wheel had caused the vibration. We cleaned up and climbed normally. ATC was giving us vectors to avoid the numerous thunderstorms in the area. My First Officer (FO) and I had a short discussion on what might have caused the vibration as we navigated around the storms. Once clear of the weather we immediately received a message from Dispatch that the Tower reported that we had blown a tire on take-off. After reviewing AOM; non normal landing on a flat tire; we discussed options and decided to continue to ZZZ1. This was the best option to burn off fuel with long dry runways at sea level. It was also an online Maintenance station and delivered our passengers to their destination. Returning to ZZZ was not an option due to the weather and wet runways. I contacted our Dispatcher via Company radio with the plan; asked them to [request priority handling]; have the ZZZ1 station prepared for a possible tow to the gate; and to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) waiting upon our arrival. Our Dispatcher was in agreement with the plan. I briefed the Flight Attendants and passengers of the status of the aircraft and that we would experience a landing with possible vibrations during the roll out. I assured all that I was not concerned about the landing; but we would have ARFF vehicles standing by as an extra measure of safety and they could inspect the aircraft before we taxied to the gate. On approach I extended the gear early to assure proper function. The landing gear extended normally. However; we did not have a green left main gear safe light on the front panel but had all three green on the overhead panel. Having the left main green light out on the front panel confirmed that the vibration and tire/s failure was most likely on the left main gear.I asked the Tower to observe our landing gear on our approach. They confirmed that all landing gear appeared to be down. I landed normally with a flaps 40 setting for slower speed. Touchdown was soft and the aircraft settled with left wing low. I had to use the right rudder to keep the center line during deceleration. I used reverse thrust to slow the aircraft primarily then used light braking while using most of the runway to stop and not to stress the remaining tire unnecessarily. ARFF assessed the aircraft; and it was determined that it was safe to taxi to the gate. I had them follow us to the gate. The aircraft had lost the recap on the inboard left main gear tire; and I believe it was deflated as well. It damaged the flaps and sections on the wing.

We quickly discovered the unreliable airspeed indicator. Completed some of the memory items associated with this issue. Told ATC we needed to return. We remained in IMC conditions for the remainder of the flight. Ran the checklist for unreliable airspeed. Overweight landing. Non routine landing; and subsequently ENG EEC alternate mode. We had an uneventful landing and taxi to the gate under our own power. Elected to use ATC vectors instead of holding. No injuries; no damage to aircraft other than pitot tube and possibly air temperature probe which affected the EEC's per maintenance call. Log book entries included.

I checked the speed tape; said speed verified; and moved the flap lever to position 1. Within a few seconds; we received the ECAM: F/CTL SLATS FAULT. The CA assumed control of the aircraft while I determined it wasn't a quick action item or ECAM exception. The CA the said his aircraft; his radios; and called for the ECAM actions. The Tower gave us missed approach radar vectors over the lake while we worked through the QRH procedures. While going through these procedures; we determined the slats were stuck in the up position; but the flaps seemed to be working normally. Due to our configuration issue and our fuel level starting to get low; the CA [asked for priority handling] back to ZZZ. I did another landing assessment with the slat failure; and we agreed that we had more than adequate runway for landing. The CA temporarily gave me the aircraft and radios while he reviewed the non-routine landing considerations; spoke to the flight attendants; and advised the passengers of the situation. As anticipated; as we configured the plane for landing following the QRH procedures; the plane entered alternate law and then direct law. We landed on Runway XXL with the slats up; flaps at 3; and the landing gear down and locked. The landing was uneventful; and we taxied to the gate as normal; except that we elected to leave the flap lever where it was in case that might help Maintenance in their duties.",,"We started to configure the aircraft at ZZZZZ; ILS XXR. At the appropriate speed I called for Flaps 1; First Officer (FO) stated speed verified; and moved the flap lever to 1. We received in the lower display; ECAM F/CTL Slats Fault. Initiated non-normal procedures (My aircraft; FO determined it wasn't a Quick Action or ECAM exception--I stated my aircraft/my radios ECAM action). We talked to Tower and were given directions for the missed approach. ATC proceeded to vector us over the area while we worked through the QRH procedures. After following the QRH procedures; we determined the slats were stuck in the up position. We [requested priority handing] back to ZZZ due our configuration issue and fuel situation (it was getting low). I did give the aircraft/radios to the FO while I went through the non-routine landing considerations in which I spoke to flight attendants of the situation; (flap/slat configuration issue; Airport rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles may be present; etc.) and spoke to the passengers why the go-around and lengthy time to land due to a configuration issue. While configuring the plane and following the QRH the aircraft flight safety parameters degraded by entering alternate law and eventually direct law; which was anticipated per the checklist. We ended up landing on Runway XXL with slats up; flaps 3; gear down. The landing and taxi back was uneventful.Side note: The First Officer did an outstanding job throughout this ordeal. The QRH checklist for this problem is complicated; but he did a great job working through this checklist to termination (determining flap configuration; using the non-normal landing distance app; etc.).",,"A321 flight crew reported receiving an ECAM F/CTL SLATS FAULT on approach.

We reviewed the situation and QRH actions for loss of C HYD pressure in case the remaining fluid leaked when the C HYD system was pressurized. On approach we [requested priority handling]; ran remaining items on the C HYD quantity checklist and configured early for the ILS XXL. At 1500 ft. AGL on a coupled ILS approach we got a TCAS TA followed by a climb RA. Despite being a priority and having no visual on any aircraft; we respected the RA. We were visual with the terrain but inflight visibility was hazy. The RA was abnormal because during the RA the target stayed at 00 and at the tip of the airplane display during the 1000 ft. climb in response to RA. Tower announced there was no traffic in the area; but we elected to follow the RA. After resolution; we were too high to resume the ILS; and asked for a 360; but accepted vectors back to ZZZZZ to re complete the full approach. We had briefed no configuration changes during missed approach due to our hydraulic situation. We reset the Mode Control Panel (MCP) and FMC after RA completion and continued for subsequent approach. We got clearance for direct ZZZZZ and then clearance for the approach. Slight deviations to altitude occurred as we tried to re engage VNAV path. We realized the issue was re cruising VNAV and then VNAV path properly engaged just prior to ZZZZZ. Again; during the descent through 4500 MSL onto the dogleg out of ZZZZZ we again got a TCAS TA followed by a climb RA. This time we noted the altitude of the target always reading 00 and staying with us. Tower assured us that we did not have traffic in the area. We applied the direction on page x that complying a second time with a likely anomalous RA would subject the aircraft to further hazard. On ILS final the nuisance RA was not an issue; and we landed uneventfully. We cleared the runway when the hydraulic system showed normal indications. Once clear; we had fire crews examine the aircraft for leaking fluid. We asked for and received tug assistance to a hard stand and deplaned. Local Maintenance personnel met the aircraft; and confirmed that the C HYD RES was empty.",,"I was the Pilot flying (PF) and First Officer (FO) was PM. FO was still on break. During the last 2 hours of cruise; all auto-flight on at FL350; EICAS warned us of low center hydraulic system quantity. We noted C HYD QTY at 0.48 with refill light on and followed checklist guidance to turn off all center pumps until final approach. After the checklists were complete; we elected to let FO remain on rest; but wake them 15 minutes early to review the checklist completion issues together. We called Dispatch; and spoke with Maintenance. They agreed with the continuation to ZZZ; with the likelihood that normal configuration for landing was still likely; and Dispatch agreed to notify the station of a need for tow in and the airport of our need for the long Runway XXL which is normally takeoffs only. FM (Flight Manager) was called to the cockpit; and briefed on the issues. We told them to share the problem with the crew; that a prep for evacuation was not needed yet; and that the passengers would not be briefed unless the situation deteriorated. They asked what could make this worse and I shared the issue of a 20 flaps non normal landing was possible if the rest of the fluid leaked out before final approach. In that case we would reevaluate the need to prepare for evacuation. They understood everything and went back to the cabin. After FO came back to the cockpit; and during descent; we [requested priority handling] as we were not sure if we would be stuck with only 20 flaps (alternate extension method) if the hydraulic quantity ran out. On downwind; we completed the deferred checklist items and were able to fully configure the aircraft with gear and 30 flaps. C HYD quantity decreased to about 35% after gear and flaps extension. We cleared the ILS to the longer Runway (XXL) which for ZZZ is not the standard for arrivals. We had coordinated with Approach Control about 30 minutes prior so they could switch the ILS to the inner runway. Weather was about 1 mile visibility mostly due to smog; but cloudiness still allowed us to see most of the terrain north of the airport while above 4000 ft. At 1500 ft. AGL on a coupled ILS approach we got a TCAS TA followed by a climb RA. Despite being a priority aircraft and have no visual on any aircraft; we respected the RA. After resolution; we were too high to resume the ILS; and asked for a 360; but accepted longer vectors back around. Due to the checklist directions for a C HYD malfunction; this maneuver was flown fully configured. Since we could not use a standard go-around procedure; and the maneuver required me to hand fly; minor deviations from 6000 MSL assigned altitude occurred until we reset the flight director. We still had plenty of fuel for about 2 hours. We were vectored by to the ZZZZZ IAF for the ILS XXL with gear down and 30 flaps. We got clearance direct ZZZZZ and then clearance for the approach. Slight deviations to altitude occurred as we tried to re engage VNAV path. We realized the issue was re cruising VNAV and then VNAV path properly engaged just prior to ZZZZZ. Again; during the descent through 4500 MSL locked onto the dogleg out of ZZZZZ we again got a TCAS TA followed by a climb RA. This time we noted the altitude of the target always reading 00 and staying with us. Tower assured us that we did not have traffic in the area. We applied the direction on page x that complying a second time with a likely anomalous RA would subject the aircraft to further hazard. On ILS final the nuisance RA was not an issue; and we landed uneventfully. We cleared the runway noting proper C HYD pressure at all times; and the preserved fluid for brakes and steering. Once clear; we had fire crews examine the aircraft for leaking fluid. There was none evident. We asked for and received tug assistance to a hard stand and deplaned. Local Maintenance personnel met the aircraft; and confirmed that the C HYD RES was empty.Superior job by my flight crew; and the Flight Attendants who were very attentive to my directions. Both FO's were fantastic at ensuring the safest operation of the aircraft; and supporting me as the PF; despite the dramatic challenges we faced. They ensured we all maintained the proper awareness in a very challenging priority approach; including language barriers; poor visibility; terrain; and challenges to using auto flight as the auto pilot needed to be off at certain points during a low altitude condition. Checklist direction on fluid amounts below 50% could be much clearer; and I will submit suggested changes. The manual seems to indicate that if the C HYD system goes into isolation for reserve brakes and steering (occurs below 50% QTY) that the normal movement of flaps and gear may not occur. We knew the center system was in isolation (light on the right side panel illuminated during descent and prior to turning the CTR pumps on again). We stuck with the checklist discipline of just doing the deferred items on the QTY checklist but had the uncomfortable feeling that we might end up with a gear sequence error if the handle was lowered and zero fluid was available due to the isolation condition. We had tons of time to review such guidance and clarity had it been in the manual. It should help the crew with confidence to run the QTY checklist until the system cannot maintain pressure; then switch to the pressure checklist to complete configuration to flaps 20.",,"B767 flight crew reported loss of C hydraulic system during cruise.

I thought we had had an engine failure and aborted the takeoff. We decelerated the aircraft as smoothly as possible and exited the runway. During the rollout we were able to discern that the engine had not failed; but were unclear on what may have happened. The first officer then mentioned that he thought he saw a piece of paper blowing across the runway indicating that perhaps there was a dust devil in the area of the runway.  We brought the aircraft to a stop on the taxiway.  Approximately five minutes after this; a company ops car came by to assess the situation and communicated to the tower who communicated to us that the two left main tires had blown. We then set about coordinating with company to have passengers transported back to terminal as the aircraft could not be taxied. At this point in time; my only guess is that a significant wind event took place at that part of the runway; causing the aircraft to move as it did. It was as close to a simulator engine failure as I could ever imagine. The ATIS at that time was just showing a normal day for ZZZ.

After some significant taxi delays; Aircraft X; with 115 SOB; finally lifted off from Runway XXL at XA42Z and was turned South toward ZZZZZ intersection. South of ZZZ was a rapidly developing line of weather running on an East-West line. Using our weather radar; we were able to discern several embedded cells with multiple small areas of green (light) precipitation between; and those were the areas the preceding aircraft were utilizing to navigate through the line. The First Officer (FO); as flying pilot; initiated a discussion about a left turn to avoid penetrating the weather; but due to proximity; the thin nature of the line; and gaps between severe cells it was decided to continue. Just before entering the clouds we observed lightning on both sides of the aircraft and ATC issued a report to us of severe turbulence reported on our track at FL230 and; since we were much lower; we reduced our rate of climb in an attempt to avoid the turbulence. We were flying an assigned airspeed of 250 kts. Aircraft X; approx 5 miles in trail of a preceding aircraft; then penetrated the weather and encountered moderate to severe turbulence at approx FL180. Unreported heavy hail was encountered almost immediately and lasted 10-15 seconds; during which time the First Officer's windscreen was impacted with sufficient force to shatter the outer pane of the window. An immediate ECAM was also generated for failure of the right windshield anti-ice heating element. After another 15-30 seconds the aircraft was clear of all rain and clouds. Out of concern for the integrity of the remaining inner pane of the windscreen; Aircraft X [requested priority handling] with ATC; stopped our climb; asked for vectors around the weather back to ZZZ; and descended back down to 17000 ft. (to limit the force of aircraft pressurization on the broken window). Aircraft speed was limited to 250 kts. maximum by the crew to further minimize aerodynamic pressure on the remaining window pane. ATC vectored Aircraft X to the East approximately 100 NM in order to circumnavigate the weather. The Flight Attendants were briefed on the situation and information was discussed; and the Captain announced the general nature of the aircraft condition along with the plan to return to ZZZ in a PA to the passengers. After establishing on eastbound vectors; the Captain notified Dispatch of the aircraft state and intentions. A brief discussion regarding a divert to ZZZ1 was held over ACARS; but the crew felt best with a return to ZZZ remaining clear of all weather and Dispatch did not disagree. The aircraft was able to turn to the North just East of the ZZZ2 navaid. Shortly thereafter the aircraft was able to turn West toward ZZZ and remain clear of weather while returning for landing. We flew direct ZZZZZ1 then direct ZZZ and eventually were given vectors to a medium final to the ILS XXC. Due to a distorted forward view from the right control seat due to the various fracture lines in the window; the crew opted to transfer control to the left seat for landing at ZZZ. The landing; rollout; and taxi in were uneventful. The aircraft parked at y at XB14L. Maintenance action items were submitted for the broken windscreen and the related malfunction of the right windshield anti-ice heating element. After block-in at the gate; personnel from several stakeholder organizations within the company came to the aircraft; took photos; and asked a few simple questions. The Captain and FO spoke with a pilot retiree on the flight deck. The Captain contacted the duty Chief Pilot; providing all requested information and discussed the well-being of the crew. The Captain was then contacted by another Captain and conducted a short interview. The flight deck and inflight crews both felt comfortable swapping into another aircraft and continuing on to ZZZ3. Aircraft Y (second attempt) released brakes at XC38L and arrived at the gate in ZZZ3 at 0XD43L with XXX SOB; fora total block time of 2:05.",,,,"A319 Captain reported heavy weather during climb.

In seconds; the traffic converged and climbed causing a Resolution Advisory for the aircraft now at our 930. I observed the red climb bar on the PFD. I advised the First Officer to immediately initiate a climb to avoid the conflict. Simultaneously; I looked outside and got visual contact with the Aircraft Y co-altitude; belly up and with a vector into us. It was in a hard left bank to evade. I advised Tower that we were climbing for a Resolution Advisory. He advised ZZZ [Tracon] was talking to that aircraft. Tower asked if we could still land. I advised it was not possible; and that we would take vectors for another approach. Once the aircraft was clean; stable and safe; I made a public address to the Passengers advising what happened; that automated systems advised of the conflict; that we were safe; and will be landing shortly. Passengers seemed happy after we got to the gate. The Passenger in seat 1A reported seeing another aircraft at the time that our engine noise increased. In the process of transitioning from evasive maneuver into a go-around; we got an air speed; low warning. I advised the F/O to reduce climb angle and increase power; but to monitor his speed. It was a momentary deviation. I assess this conflict as a near miss that likely would've resulted in a mid-air collision if not for immediate adherence to the Resolution Advisory. I am not sure what could've been done differently. We complied with the Resolution Advisory immediately. The Cessna was in IMC conditions that they were likely not qualified for. I believe our procedures and training allowed us to mitigate the situation and safely maneuver the aircraft while avoiding a mid-air collision.",,"On a 9-mile final into ZZZ Runway XX; established on the localizer; 1;600 ft.; 180 kts; Flaps 15; landing gear down.

Scheduled takeoff time was XA:20 local ZZZZ-time and scheduled landing time was XF:09 ZZZ-time. This was my 10th flight in the left seat during my Captain's IOE after flying as an A320 FO (First Officer) for approximately 5 years. Check Pilot was in the FO seat. Our clearance was on the ZZZZZ to ZZZZZ1 up to FL380. Preflight and taxi were normal. Takeoff was made by me from the Captain's seat off Runway XX. It was a flaps 3 flex mode takeoff with a slight headwind. Takeoff was normal through thrust reduction altitude. Just after thrust reduction at just over 1;000 ft. AGL; I maneuvered the aircraft to avoid a flock of approximately six what appeared to be large black birds that passed under the right wing. Just a few seconds later; a flock of approximately four of the same large black birds passed over the left wing; and at least one of those birds was ingested by the number one engine. There was a loud bang at the sound of the impact; the left engine immediately began vibrating loudly; and the Master Warning continuous repetitive chime went off. I said 'my aircraft;' continued flying aircraft; and engaged autopilot 1. The Check Pilot analyzed the situation and determined it was not a quick action item or ECAM exception. After a brief discussion; we decided that I would continue flying the aircraft and the Check Pilot would run the ECAM actions. At engine out acceleration altitude I selected the speed to 180 kt. and requested flaps 1 and continued climbing. We stayed at this speed and configuration until beginning the approach. We continued flying the ZZZZZ through the turn to the north for a short time while the Check Pilot worked through ECAM actions. We eventually reached 8000 ft. and leveled off.The Check Pilot and I each spoke to the FAs (Flight Attendant) over the cabin interphone during the first couple minutes after the bird strike. The FAs told us what they knew about the incident from their perspective. By the second time we spoke; the Check Pilot had put out the engine fire and I notified the FAs of this. The Check Pilot; who is fluent in the country's language and could communicate well with ATC; handled radio communications. All of his communications were in English. The Check Pilot [requested priority handling] as we were flying north on the ZZZZZ. Departure Control cleared us for a right turn direct to the airport; but the Check Pilot requested a more southerly heading to line us up for an approach; and also requested a descent to 6;000 ft. The Check Pilot requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) equipment to be positioned at the runway.The Check Pilot completed ECAM actions and QRH follow-up actions. I activated and confirmed approach mode; changed our destination to ZZZZ; and updated the PERF (Performance) Page with our landing weather. The Check Pilot loaded the RNP Y XY approach - ILS glideslope was out of service. The Check Pilot sent a message to Dispatch; and very calmly spoke with the FAs and passengers. He informed the FAs that we would be doing a precautionary landing back at ZZZZ. The Check Pilot gave the passengers a description of the situation and told them we were returning to ZZZZ. We ran the After Takeoff Checklist; Descent Checklist; and verified and briefed the approach. I flew towards ZZZZZ2 and flew through the inbound course to set up for a right turn to teardrop onto the inbound approach course. At some point before ZZZZZ2 inbound we leveled off at 6;000 ft. I configured with gear and flaps 3 prior to ZZZZZ3 and we ran the Before Landing Checklist. Autobrakes were medium. I landed on Runway XY and used full reverse thrust from engine number two and began braking immediately. We stopped just prior to Taxiway XX. The fire personnel looked over the aircraft and cleared us to taxi to parking. Ground Control cleared us to Gate XX where we parked the aircraft.Cause: Bird strike to the number 1 engine. Suggestions: Continue to emphasize the dangers of bird strikes.",,"I am a Company Check Pilot. I was giving Operational Experience; OE; to a Captain upgrade; to include [several] location qualifications. The flight was the return flight; from ZZZZ to ZZZ; on Day 0. The Captain upgrade had already flown 8 flights and 7 landings with a previous Check Pilot; and was a previous First Officer on the A320 aircraft for approximately 5 years. Scheduled takeoff time was XA:20 local ZZZZ-time and scheduled landing time was XF:09 ZZZ-time. Our clearance was on the ZZZZZ to ZZZZZ1 up to FL380.Preflight and taxi were normal. We took off from ZZZZ at XA:31 local time from Runway XX. The takeoff was made by the Captain upgrade from the left seat. It was a normal flaps 3 flex takeoff with a slight headwind. At approximately 1;100 ft. AGL and just after thrust reduction; I saw a flock of approximately six large black birds on the right side of the aircraft. I called 'birds;' and the Captain upgrade maneuvered the aircraft to avoid the birds. Unfortunately; there was another flock of approximately 4 of the same birds on the left side of the aircraft; and immediately we heard a loud thump; accompanied by moderately loud vibration; followed by engine #1 fire indications.The Captain upgrade stated 'my aircraft' and continued flying the aircraft. I began the strategy; after analyzing the situation. After reviewing the Quick Reference Card; QRC; I determined it was not a quick action item or ECAM exception. Following a brief discussion; as a crew; we decided that the Captain upgrade would continue to fly the aircraft and I would run the ECAM actions.Upon reaching engine out acceleration altitude; I commanded the Captain upgrade to hold 180 kt. He requested flaps 1 and continued climbing. We maintained this speed and configuration until reaching 8;000 ft. MSL; while flying the ZZZZZ departure.The flight attendants called numerous times over the cabin interphone within minutes ensuing the bird strike. They reported smoke in the aft cabin and fire in the left engine. I told them we were aware of the situation and were in the process of taking appropriate action and returning to the airport. I asked them to remain calm and I would get back to them soon as conditions permit. I continued running the ECAM actions and was able to put the fire out after discharging the first bottle. It was at this time; I [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Approach; who cleared us to proceed direct to the airport. I then requested a south heading and descent to 6;000 ft.; which enabled us to clear the local terrain. Additionally; it is the FAF intercept altitude for the RNAV Runway XY. During our thorough preflight planning from ZZZ; we became aware that the ILS was out of service in ZZZZ and not an option. Due to factors such as being fluent in the local language; I decided to handle all ATC communications; although all communications were accomplished in English. To follow suit; I then requested ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting) equipment to meet the aircraft after landing; and completed the After-Takeoff Checklist.I accomplished the ECAM and QRH follow-up actions; then sent free text message to Dispatch; communicated to the flight attendants to give them a quick update on the situation and informed them that we would be doing a precautionary landing at ZZZZ. To conclude; I made a PA to the passengers and prepared to complete the remaining normal checklists before landing. The Captain upgrade changed the destination and I selected the RNAV Y Runway XY. He then activated and confirmed approach mode; updated the PERF (Performance) Page with current weather conditions and flew towards ZZZZZ2; IF. The Captain upgrade informed me he intended to fly through the inbound course to set up for a right turn to teardrop onto the inbound approach course. He was level at 6;000 ft. before ZZZZZ2. We briefed the highlights of the approach and completed the Before-Landing Checklist.The Captain upgrade questioned if we should land flaps 3 or flaps full; to which I decided on flaps 3; due to single engine go-around considerations. We configured with gear; flaps 3; and medium autobrakes prior to ZZZZZ3. Since it was apparent he had good aircraft control; I made the decision to continue to let him fly the approach and land overweight. He landed on Runway XY; using full reverse thrust from engine number two along with immediate manual braking. We came to a complete stop just prior to Taxiway XX. The fire personnel looked over the aircraft; clearing us to taxi to parking. Ground Control cleared us to Gate XX where we brought the aircraft to a final stop.Although we were visually inspected by ARFF personnel; I questioned their ability to assess and conduct firefighting procedures on the aircraft. My intuition further increased after personnel arrived up in a small yellow truck; with no alert or safety flashing lights. They were in direct communication with us and Tower; where communications were in the local language. I am still perplexed by what kind of safety equipment they use; their firefighting capabilities; and what initial and recurrent training consists of. Pilots need to be aware of what to expect in case of an emergency. I am awaiting further information from the ZZZZ General Manager.Cause: Flock of birds on both sides of the aircraft. Unfortunately; airports in ZZZZ2 do not have a wildlife animal control at their airports. It would be nice if something similar to what we do in the States could be introduced in these countries.",,"A319 flight crew reported an inflight shutdown of engine #1 due to the indication of fire in the engine caused by a bird strike.

Everything was fine until we reached V1. As soon as my hand was a few inches off of the throttles; the fire warning horn and lights were going off everywhere. We were just past V1 so we were in go mode. As soon as I got the gear up and saw the aircraft was under control I looked down to see what all was lit up. We had both master caution lights; both fire warning lights; the fire bell; both engine 1 and 2 overheat lights; engine 1 and 2 fire handles lit up; the APU fire handle lit up and the wheel well fire light lit up. I immediately [requested priority handling] and told them we wanted to climb to 2500 ft. while entering a left downwind and base and land back on XXL. The FO was very sharp and I asked them if they felt comfortable doing that on their own while I worked the problem. They were fine and I kept an eye on the plane and our position while getting into the checklist. I went straight to the wheel well fire checklist because I felt that was our biggest threat. Both engines were running normal and no abnormal indications and the APU was off so I thought the wheel well could be on fire or have bad indications. I gave souls on board; fuel in minutes; stated our intentions and asked them to relay our situation to our company. I did the QRH; we quickly set up for the approach and turned base for XXL.I tested the lead Flight Attendant (FA) and gave a very brief PA to the passengers; ran the descent and landing checklists and landed and stopped on taxiway x. We shut both engines down and Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) said all indications were normal and no abnormal heat anywhere. We got a gate from ops; started the engines and taxied to gate. Before we taxied onto the J-line I had them check the temps again and then we taxied in and de-boarded the people. After we re-started both engines I went to put the generators online and generator 2 started the fire bell and warning lights again. Generator 1 did not trip it. I put it on the APU and it did the same thing. I went back to the engine driven generators and same thing and again went back to the APU. When we went to ground power at the gate it did the same thing with the horn and lights. From there I wrote everything up and talked to Dispatch; Maintenance at ZZZ; Ops and the Chief Pilot. From there I made sure the passengers in the terminal were taken care of and then took care of the crew. We all went to the hotel for a much needed rest. I have no idea what set all of this in motion but I thought the crew; ATC; Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF); Ops; Dispatch; Maintenance and the Chief Pilot all did their jobs very well.",,"On takeoff roll saw fire master warning light right at V1. Captain said to continue so preceded to rotate at Vr. Once airborne we saw that we had all 3 fire handles illuminating along with the wheel well fire light and both engine overheat lights. The Captain said they smelled something when we brought the gear up but since we had all those lights we were not sure how to diagnose. We announced the situation at about 1500 ft. and I told the Captain to let Tower know I was turning left into the downwind. The Captain pulled the wheel well fire checklist since we did not have any secondary engine fire indications. I hand flew the aircraft at pattern altitude while the Captain ran the checklist and communicated with Tower. Once the checklist was complete I turned final and asked for final flaps with the landing checklist. I verified we were cleared to land and had an uneventful landing. We taxied off the runway and were inspected by the Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) before confirming that we were free from fire and getting a gate to taxi back into. As a crew; the Captain and I had really good communication and delegation of duties. I focused on the flying and kept the runway in sight and was ready to turn in for landing as soon as we were finished with our checklist. We had talked about what indications we were seeing and were able to quickly come up with a diagnosis and direction to a checklist. The Captain did a good job of coming in and out of the checklist when I was requesting configuration to remain close to the field. They also had a good suggestion for me to keep in the back of my mind when I touched down to be cautious of blown tires since we did not know if we had an actual wheel well fire or not at that point. Once on the ground we did a good job of communicating with Ground and CFR while keeping the crew and passengers informed of progress. Debriefing it together the only thing we could come up with that we could have done differently would have been to not raise the gear in case it was a wheel well fire. At the time; we were pretty sure it was an electrical issue due to the fact that so many lights had illuminated. What I would have done differently would have been to get flaps 5 with flaps 5 speed sooner to keep my pattern tighter and give more time for the checklist.",,"B737 flight crew reported the fire detection system malfunctioned after takeoff.

The aircraft also exhibited a slight veer to the left at the same time.  I felt this was an aircraft controllability issue (potential nose wheel gear or tire failure or separation) and therefore I made the decision to reject the takeoff. The RTO maneuver was initiated at 110 knots (VI-115 KTS) in accordance with company SOPs. The RTO QRC and RTO non-normal and brake cooling for 737-700 were completed. Due to the light weight of the aircraft; brake temperatures did not reach the caution or warning zones. As part of my RTO Briefings; I brief the First Officers to also request ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) if the RTO is performed in the High speed regime. The First Officer and I quickly discussed staying on the runway or exiting.  The taxiways were wide enough that we felt ARFF would have adequate maneuvering capabilities around the aircraft and therefore elected to clear the runway so that the runway was still usable after the runway FOD check was completed.ARFF response was within 3 minutes.  Communication was established with ARFF and ATC quickly and an assessment for fire or damage was completed.  I requested that the aircraft be chocked so the parking brake would not have to be set. ARFF performed temp checks of the main gears.  Left main temperature was 502 and right main temperature was 400. ARFF set up a fan to cool the gear while we coordinated with company and airport operations. We decided to have the aircraft towed to the gate and the tow-in checklist was referenced.After all procedures were completed I briefed the passengers and the First Officer and I had a debrief with the inflight crew to discuss the event.  All crew members felt communication was clear and concise and everyone remained calm.Once able; I called and debriefed the Chief Pilot on duty; and the HF checklist was conducted on me and my First Officer. I then called dispatch to conference with Maintenance Control to give a verbal debrief of the event. I also met with the ARFF crew to discuss and complement them on their response actions.The next day the nose wheel tires were changed and I was told by Maintenance Control there was evidence of tire imbalance.  We ferried the aircraft the next day to ZZZ1 and on taxi in the nose gear began to randomly vibrate at normal taxi speeds. Entry was made for nose gear vibration and I verbally briefed the outgoing flight crew and the mechanics. Maintenance elected to take the aircraft out of service for additional inspections and an additional tire replacement. I met with the maintenance manager later to ask for an update. I was told that when they removed the replacement tires and there was evidence of flat spots and they were going to begin inspections of the entire nose wheel gear and components.",,"We were cleared for take-off to fly tower assigned heading (Departure Runway- XXR). I was the PM (pilot monitoring) and Captain was the pilot flying. After the take-off thrust was set; I called 100 knots; when extreme vibration started from the nose wheel of the airplane. The Captain decided to reject the takeoff before V1 was called out. The rejection was done at approximately 110 IAS and the Captain followed the RTO procedures specified in the FM. I verified the procedure and made the required calls of 80 Knots and informed ATC and made the PA; 'Remain Seated; Remain Seated'.We discussed and decided to vacate the runway (from Taxi-way 1); and advised tower to roll out the fire trucks; since we rejected above 100 knots. We held short of Taxi-way 2 on 3. The Captain tried to set the parking brakes; however he was not able to do so. Also; at the time the parking brake indicator light went out (INOP). The Captain called for the RTO QRC; which was completed and after discussing the situation with the FA in the cabin; the decision was made not to evacuate. The Fire Rescue team (4-trucks) responded and were next to us within 3 minutes. I continued on the checklist and calculated the brake-cooling time; which was approximately 45-50 minutes for our weight and speed. We were out of the caution and warning zone. Communication was established with the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) team and Captain advised them to put chocks on the nose wheel (since we could not set the parking brake). The ARFF team advised us that they did not see any visual damage to the landing gear or the tires. There was also no indication of fire or smoke. We started the APU and decided to the shut down both engines for the safety of ARFF and ground personnel.We decided the aircraft was in good condition; however as a precaution; we requested airport operations and company operations to have our aircraft towed to the gate. The captain made a PA and was advised by the FA that everyone was calm. He also advised them that we will be heading to the gate. While the tow truck was being organized; the tower switched us to ground frequency and we were in contact with ARFF; ground and airport Ops. We followed the supplementary procedure to be towed to the gate. Once at the gate; we performed the parking checklist and the passengers were deplaned using the jet bridge. We made the required reports (verbal/ACARS) to Chief Pilot; dispatch; maintenance and put in two ELB reports -  i) For the RTO due to Extreme Nosewheel Vibration and ii) Parking Brake Light in-op.The ARFF team came to meet us at the flight deck and gave us the information about gear temperature (500+ for left gear and 450+for right). They also mentioned that they used fans to cool down the gear system. We were advised by Maintenance Control that they will have Maintenance check the nose wheel assembly and have both the wheels replaced. However; due to lack resources at an out-station; the wheels could not be replaced and the flight was canceled.Next; day we were scheduled to operate the ferry flight to take the airplane back to ZZZ1. The Captain was informed that the vibration may have been caused due to wheel being out of balance. The wheels were replaced and we departed ZZZ. However; upon landing and taxing in at ZZZ1; we felt vibrations in nose-wheel again and we made an ELB write up again. We also briefed the next crew on the situation and the aircraft was taken out of service and additional inspection. The Captain was advised by the Maintenance manager/supervisor in ZZZ1 that the replacement tire had flat spots and will inspect the nose wheel assembly and the gear system too.",,"B737 flight crew reported a rejected take off at 110 knots for violent lateral nose wheel vibrations. The flight crew returned to the gate and turned the aircraft over to maintenance.",

We then decided to go around to troubleshoot the problem. We notified ATC that we would need delay vectors to run the necessary checklists. We ran the QRH checklist for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree; the checklist had us setup to use the alternate flap extension procedure.  After getting flaps 15 landing data and brake cooling data for Runway XXR we had ATC vector us back around for another approach. The leading flaps and slats extended to the full ext position using the alternate flap switch. When we went to extend the trailing edge flaps; only the left began to extended and I immediately stopped extending the flaps as we now had flap asymmetry. We notified ATC we could not fly the approach and would need a longer runway at ZZZ1 along with delay vectors. We began to run the QRH checklist for Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry as directed by the QRH 'Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree' checklist. As ATC began to vector us for ZZZ1 dispatch sent us an ACARS message that they ran the numbers for a Flaps up landing and that XXR at ZZZ would be suitable for a 0 flaps landing. We ran the numbers as well and agreed with dispatch. We then completed the QRH checklist and received Brake cooling data as well. We notified ATC that we could in fact accept XXR at ZZZ and received vectors for the visual approach. We Performed a 0 flaps landing on Runway XXR at ZZZ. As directed by the brake cooling data; we proceeded to Pad XX and waited the 70 minutes for the brakes to cool with fire trucks monitoring.  After the 70 minutes we proceeded to Gate XX and deplaned.

On Captain's cockpit preparation it was noted that both engines had 21.5 quarts of oil. After the engines started I noted that the oil had dropped in quantity as usual. Take-off was normal as well as the climb till around FL 250 Captain noticed the flashing advisory about the right engine oil quantity. It was down to about 1.5 quarts. Having not seen the quantity so low we asked for level off at FL 300 to see if with reduced power the quantity would go up. It did not and it in fact continued to decrease to .5; also the pressure was now coming down and showing amber. Captain gave control to the First Officer (FO). We adjusted cruise speed to see how that would affect pressure and quantity. Quantity went to zero. Pressure went back and forth between amber and red a couple of times. At this time Captain started looking at the QRH on advisory oil quantity we would expect to see an increase after power reduction and to monitor engine oil parameters. EGT; N1 and N2 remained normal the entire time. Captain used SATCOM to call Dispatch and to request Maintenance on the call also. Maintenance was seeing exactly what we saw. The master warning came on a couple times for a short time then off. Captain made the decision to secure the engine after the ECAM warning came on and stayed on. With Dispatch we came up with a diversion to ZZZ1. We ran the ECAM then QRH. During this time FO flew and communicated with ATC our plan to divert to ZZZ1 and requested priority handling. Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) was requested. Captain called the Flight Attendant (FA) at the beginning of the running of the ECAM and QRH and told them to stop any service till I had gotten back to them after informing them of a possible diversion. After ECAM and QRH was complete Captain called FAs and gave the briefing info stating the situation at that time. A passenger PA was made about what had happened and our plan to go to ZZZ1. On descent into ZZZ1 and running an overweight landing checklist. FO entered in a hold while we briefed the approach before Captain took over as Pilot Flying (PF). Before beginning the approach the FO ran the divert guide. We began the approach; autopilot was turned off and an overweight landing was successful. Landing was smooth. We taxied off the runway and CFR checked both the engine for heat or any other anomalies as well as the brakes. All were good. We taxied to the ramp and waited about 47 minutes for company personnel and ground personnel to get into position. At the gate after the shutdown Captain stood in the galley and made a PA about what had happened and about the company sending another airplane to complete their trip to ZZZ2. Captain also informed anyone who had questions while deplaning that they would answer them. FO did a walk around and saw lots of oil on the ground and on the bottom engine cowl. Logbook was noted with a write up.",,"The flight was a completely nominal take-off and climb out. Around FL 250 the Captain noticed and pointed out the pulsing engine oil quantity ~1.5 quarts. We briefly discussed it and at about 27300 ft. they asked me to request a level off at FL 300 to see if the quantity would resume to normal indications. It did not. We looked at the QRH to look up low engine oil quantity. The guidance was to continue unless the oil pressure registered low. As the oil quantity continued to decrease; the Captain transferred the controls to me and called the company via SATCOM to expand the team. The oil quantity dropped to 0 as they were placing the call. Also; the oil pressure began to fall. While discussing potential alternates; the oil pressure ECAM briefly activated a couple of times. All other engine parameters remained normal. The ECAM warning then appeared again; this time not going away. They quickly ended the SATCOM conversation with the decision that we would be diverting to ZZZ1. They then followed the ECAM actions for low engine; oil pressure; shutting down the #2 engine. They then briefed the crew and the passengers of our divert. While they were briefing everyone of our intentions; I gathered the weather for ZZZ1 and advised ATC of our intentions to divert. They instructed us to proceed directly to ZZZ1 and descend to FL 220. I believe the time from level off to the start of our descent to be about 12-15 minutes. I also pulled up the ZZZ1 approach chart to Runway XX and began to familiarize myself with it. I also sent landing data for Runway XX while they were briefing everyone. The Captain reviewed the weather; landing data; overweight landing checklist and approach to XX while we held two circuits at the marker. While they were doing this I reviewed the diversion checklist. They briefed the approach; and transferred the controls. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The Captain's touchdown was smooth; and we taxied off the runway to allow Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) to determine that the brakes and our engine appeared normal.

We were cleared for takeoff; and everything was normal from brake release to about 80 kts. Just when I was about to make the 80 kts. call; there was a loud bang; the aircraft shuddered and yawed significantly to the right. The Captain immediately rejected the take-off and used the rudder to the right to keep it on the runway. We slowed to a manageable speed (unknown; I wasn't looking anymore); and I saw engine fail displayed on the number 2 engine display with the EGT dropping. I called Tower to tell them we aborted the takeoff and requested to roll Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles and we had a right engine failure. We exited the runway on taxiway x and held on y to assess and run checklists. The Captain told the passengers to remain seated. We also told Tower that they should check the runway for debris due to the engine failure. We ran the engine failure checklist and coordinated with Tower; fire trucks; Dispatch; Ops; passengers and Flight Attendants to make sure everything and everybody was okay. After about 15-20 minutes of coordination and checklists; we taxied back to the terminal; parked and allowed the passengers to deplane.",,"During takeoff; prior to 80 kts; the pilots heard a loud bang and their #2 engine failed.

An ENG 1 stall ECAM warning subsequently appeared but quickly disappeared. The next ECAM to appear was the ENG 1 FAIL warning. During this period I observed a vapor briefly enter the cockpit via the vents above the windows - it quickly dissipated and was not observed again. Captain called for ECAM actions after establishing positive control; and I ran through the ECAM procedure. There were no applicable OEBs (Operational Engineering Bulletins). We determined that damage had occurred; and that fuel was not leaking. We reviewed the affected systems pages; and after ECAM actions were complete we verified that all checklists were completed and that there were no resets or relights possible prior to reviewing the status page. We also determined that we would be overweight for landing. We considered reviewing the comm procedures but determined that that activity was not a priority. I resumed comms at this point briefly before taking control while the Captain set up for; and briefed; the approach. They then took back control and comms so that I could run the landing distance assessment. After I completed that; I resumed pilot monitoring duties for the remainder of the flight. Captain executed the RNAV XXL approach to land smoothly and uneventfully; the landing was very soft. We stopped on the runway and waited for Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to approach the airplane and conduct a visual inspection. ARFF communicated with us directly on Tower frequency and told us there were no indications of fire or leaking fluids. We taxied to the ramp and gate with ARFF on the trail as a precaution.",,"The flight originated in ZZZ with destination to ZZZ1 and additionally was a training event OE new student.

At approximately 75 ft. the descent rate slowed; the aircraft continued to drift above the glideslope and a long landing was looking probable. The PF continued to vocalize correcting. Once the aircraft was outside the touchdown zone and a long landing was evident; the PM (Pilot Monitoring) called for a go around. At the same time a call for go around was initiated; the PF had reduced the thrust levers to idle. As the PF initiated the go around; the Main Landing Gear momentarily touched the runway. During the pitch up and engine spool up; the PM felt a bump indicating a possible tailstrike. ATC gave an initial heading and altitude to climb to; as well as a new runway assignment. The PF loaded the ILS for the new runway and sent for landing data since the runway was significantly shorter. During the vectors to intercept; the PM vocalized that his side was not receiving the signal from the ILS frequency. The PF said his side was receiving the signal. ATC gave a vector to intercept; and again; the PM vocalized that the signal was not being received on his side. The aircraft passed through the LOC course and ATC gave a new heading to intercept. The PF acknowledged he was not receiving the signal and the PM loaded the RNAV approach to the runway to provided course and vertical guidance.

At approximately 130 kt. the aircraft felt like the left side surged up in and then back down; then the left engine spooled back. I felt like we lost one or both tires. I called that out to the Captain. They agreed and called for a rejection. I responded with; "Agree reject." Then called; "Extended and deployed." Then; "Autobrake disarm.' We were stopped before I could call out the speed. I radioed the Tower that we had rejected on the runway and to standby. The Captain said wait and made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated. Then we reviewed the lights and status. We had no engine fire indication. But the left engine N1 was zero. I am not sure on what checklist we did or didn't do in that window. The CA (Captain) said I think we can taxi so I coordinated with the Tower to move off on the taxiway. And I [requested priority handling] and told them to send the fire trucks. When stopped on the taxiway I told the Fire Lead that the left engine and wheels were the concern.They checked them out; and said that they saw smoke coming from the left engine. The Fire Lead said they would inspect the left. The Captain and I agreed immediately to fire a bottle into the engine. There was still no fire indication. I ran the brake cooling while sitting on the taxiway. After the fire team cleared us from being on fire we asked for a place to park before returning to the gate; as directed by the brake cooling. We taxied on one engine to the Maintenance Ramp. There we sat while the fire team monitored the exterior. The Captain was on the phone with several company people while I monitored the fire team. Several minutes later the Fire Lead said that there was smoke coming from the engine and the temperature was rising. They said they were using a thermal monitor. I informed the Captain that I was firing the second bottle and they gave me the thumbs up. The Fire Lead would not let us return to the gate until they were confident we were not on-fire.

I had just finished a two-day the previous day out of ZZZ; where we were delayed getting back into ZZZ by almost 5 hours due to weather. So I was hoping for a simple day trip to ZZZZ today. That simply was not the case. I arrived at the airport for our report time at XA:50. I was able to meet with the CA (Captain) and discuss the upcoming day and flight. We met the previous crew of our aircraft on the jet bridge who went into great detail about the current MEL items on that specific aircraft. After discussing the situation with the crew and Dispatch; the CA and I both felt that it was the best course to not take this aircraft to ZZZZ due to the MEL items on the aircraft. We then waited another 3 or so hours for the next aircraft to become available. The CA and I boarded the new aircraft to find that there was an inbound write-up on the aircraft in regards to the brake pressure accumulator not being able to hold pressure and had lost about 800 psi in about 30 minutes. Maintenance personnel then boarded that flight and performed a test on the aircraft to see what the issue was and if it could be deferred or if the issue was more complex. The test took roughly 45 minutes to see if the brake pressure would hold or not. Maintenance informed the CA and I that the aircraft did not pass the test and would need to be taken out of service. The time now is roughly XG:30. The CA and I have been at the airport roughly 6 hours and are now looking for our 3rd aircraft to take to ZZZZ. However duty period was now an issue. We later received a phone call from Scheduling who informed us that we will now be going to ZZZ1 because we would not be legal to operate the previous flight to ZZZZ and back to ZZZ2.The CA and I again boarded our new flight to ZZZ1. We got everything ready to only have the Ramp close for about 30 minutes due to the storms in the area. Once the storms cleared we were able to push back from gate. However; due to the construction behind the gate; the Tow Driver needed to tow us in a specific area to clear the construction. We informed the driver of where to go but he was very confused and it was clear that he may not have gotten the proper training for towing in this area with the construction. Due to this confusion we ended up breaking the shear pin on the push. So we had to get Maintenance to come out and verify everything was ok before continuing on with the pushback. Once given the ok to go from Maintenance; we were able to push back to the proper area and commence the flight.The time now is roughly XJ:15 and we were on our way for departure after 8.5 hours of delays and changes. There were still so many storms in the direction of which we were going but ZZZ2 was clear. We departed with no issues. We performed the after-takeoff check and continued our climb to 10;000 ft. It was around 8;000 ft. that the CA decided to put the autopilot on by pressing Command A. The autopilot engaged. I was the pilot monitoring and received a clearance to continue climb to 18;000 ft. At that moment within 30 - 60 seconds of the autopilot being on; there was a sudden violent jolt and pitch down of the aircraft. The autopilot remained engaged. The CA and I looked at each other trying to understand what just happened. The aircraft then did the same jolt and pitch down. The CA then clicked off the autopilot. We told ATC that we want to remain at 10;000 ft. and that we had a flight control issue. The CA and I then tried Command B autopilot. It appeared to be working normally. We then tried Command A autopilot and again within 30 - 60 seconds the jolt and nose down pitch occurred. We then saw the stab out of trim light appear. We ran through the checklist and decided that it was best to go back to ZZZ2 at that time. We advised ATC and got vectors back to ZZZ2. We notified Dispatch; the FAs (Flight Attendant); and customers. We did a great job using CRM to really divide and conquer at this time. We wouldmeet back and regroup with each other. We ran the overweight checklist and proceeded to land at ZZZ2 with no issues. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) verified the aircraft was ok on the taxiway before proceeding to the gate.",,"Our showtime for the original pairing was XA:50. We were assigned an aircraft that was removed from ETOPS operations due to an APU issue. I discussed this with Dispatch and requested either an airplane with an APU that was not degraded and certified to operate over water or in ETOPS or a route of flight that was mainly over land and closer to acceptable divert airports. Even though this flight was not ETOPS I do not operate our aircraft over water more than a distance that would provide for a safe and quick diversion in the event of system failures. The Dispatcher agreed to re-route our flight. Soon after discussing this aircraft and flight plan; we were assigned another aircraft. We were not told why this decision was made. The next aircraft was wrought with even more serious issues. In addition to having a cowl anti-ice valve wired in the open position; which required reference to flight manual procedures and information; it led to another MEL item that further complicated the flight crew duties including more referencing of the flight manual and MEL procedures. Bleed air and minimum power settings. as well as split throttle positions; on an approach are serious systems that require lots of attention. Had this flight been further complicated by other system failures not anticipated; we would have been up against an enormous amount of work just to get the aircraft on the ground safely. In addition to that; there were numerous areas of thunderstorm activity on and around our route of flight. We refused the aircraft. The next aircraft they gave us came in with a write-up of brake accumulator pressure bleeding down rapidly while parked. AMTs performed a required test on the brake system and it failed. This evolution took about an hour and further delayed our operation and the aircraft was eventually taken out of service. Following this evolution; the crew desk advised us that we would not be able to complete our one-day trip without going over our Part 117 limits of a 14-hour duty day. Thus; as is allowed by the [agreement] for irregular operations; we were reassigned to a two-day trip that was about to depart. That crew was reassigned to take our two-leg turn to ZZZZ. We spoke briefly with the swap crew on the jet bridge and began setting up the cockpit for our one-leg; first-day flight to ZZZ. The second day would have us flying a leg ZZZ - ZZZ1 followed by a deadhead back to ZZZ2; flying into our day off. This was the first time we had released the parking brake on what was a very long day. During the pushback; we received instructions to position the aircraft away from construction on the ramp with the jet facing north toward the concourse. The push crew was not familiar with these instructions and had not been trained on the pushback necessary for the construction being done south of the concourse on Taxiway 1. The Tug Driver removed the tow bar pin after we set the brake; but the Ramp Controller informed us that we were not positioned correctly. We then had the Tug Driver hook up the tow bar again to reposition us correctly. This led to the shear pin being broken when the tow bar was reattached and we released the parking brake for repositioning. Following SOP; we were informed that the nose gear had to be inspected. The ground crew then reattached another tow bar and repositioned the aircraft at the gate and station maintenance personnel performed a successful inspection. We pushed back successfully and taxied for takeoff on Runway XX at ZZZ2. After an uneventful departure; we were climbing through about 8;000 ft. to level off at our assigned altitude of 10;000 ft. I engaged autopilot A/CMD and we experienced an abrupt jolt of the control column followed by two more. I immediately disengaged the autopilot and we began to look for an indication of any system malfunction. There were no abnormal signs or indications; including hydraulic pressure or fluid. We discussed the possibility that we had flown through another aircraft's wake and I engaged the autopilot again; followed by the same abrupt jolts. I disengaged the autopilot again and hand-flew the jet; leveling off at 10;000 ft. This time I noticed a flash of the STAB OUT OF TRIM light on the forward instrument panel. We also noticed lots of autotrimming of the trim wheel. The trimming was not indicative of a runaway trim condition. Autopilot B was engaged and it operated normally. The First Officer immediately referenced the flight manual for the associated light. We reviewed the checklist and performed the steps called for. We discussed our options and decided to return to ZZZ2 as the safest and most prudent course of action. We also decided to advise ATC as an extra precaution and to obtain priority handling from ATC. Dispatch was notified; crew and passengers were briefed; and we made a slow approach back toward ZZZ2 about 30 minutes after takeoff. Landing performance data was requested and received from Dispatch. We reviewed the overweight landing checklist; briefed; and flew an uneventful approach and landing to Runway XY at ZZZ2. We were followed by numerous emergency vehicles on rollout. We spoke with the Fire Commander via VHF radio and he informed us that there were no external signs of damage or overheating of the brakes. We taxied back to the gate; shut down normally; performed all checklists; and debriefed thoroughly. We sent write-ups for the system malfunction as well as the overweight landing. Together we also debriefed the Chief Pilot. He called us again a short time later and we answered questions for a human factors review. He called one last time later and informed us that we were released from duty for the remainder of the day and night.",,"B737 flight crew reported experiencing an abrupt pitch down event when engaging the autopilot system; resulting in an immediate return to the departure airport.",

The Captain made a landing where it was met with vehicles. Passengers safely deplaned as well as the flight crew. The flight crew did experience headaches and a strange taste in their throat. They were examined and advised by medics. This airplane had a fume event prior to our departure; which delayed our departure by 22 hours and 45 minutes out of a ZZZZ. Perhaps a more comprehensive inspection is in order for the aircraft.",,"This event occurred on a recovery flight after this aircraft was downed for a safety of flight event and; theoretically; stabilized with the APU deferred. Takeoff and enroute portions of the flight were unremarkable; at least in regards to this issue. I say this because we did have a few avionics/electrical issues which may or may not be related to this event.One other item of note was that we discovered afterward that one of the FAs (Flight Attendant) had noted some unusual noises from the aircraft belly before departure but didn't have time to report them to the flight deck. As the Airbus can make some unusual noises in the back; it's difficult to say whether this was truly out of the ordinary. Also; the maintenance crew that had repaired the aircraft was on the flight; and I did not hear any comment from them on these noises.In any case; the flight proceeded normally until we began our descent into ZZZ where we began to notice a smell in the flight deck. I would describe it as an electrical insulation smell; though not acrid as though something were burning. The FO (First Officer); who undoubtedly has a better sense of smell than I do; seemed to feel it was more pungent than I. I called to the back and asked if they smelled anything and at least one FA noted a smell of "new shoe leather/dirty socks."Initially; as we were already on a straight shot for the field and now below FL180; I did not feel that declaring an emergency would benefit us. But; as the FO began reporting some symptoms like scratchy throat; we decided to get the aircraft on deck as quickly as we safely could. I called to the back; told them we were [requesting priority handling]; but that it was just a precaution - there wasn't time to be more thorough and not be an impediment to safe flying. The FO and I donned our oxygen masks; though they were so difficult to communicate with that we elected to remove them for final approach. We touched down and cleared the runway. As the safety vehicles were swarming the jet; I elected to make a PA to reassure the passengers and FAs. Originally; I had thought to shut down on the taxiway; thus removing the likely source of the fumes. Unfortunately; the FO reminded me that we had no APU; which would have meant trapping the passengers on the runway in an unventilated; uncooled; unpowered aircraft until a tug; a power cart; or a set of airstairs could be dragged out to us. Faced with that; taxiing the aircraft to the gate seemed the quickest way to get the passengers away from any possible inhalation hazard.With very brief delay; we taxied into the gate and shut down. We considered and rejected using the emergency deplaning procedure as it seemed more likely to cause panic and injury than normally exiting the depowered aircraft.Overall; although things did not go anywhere near how I had expected them to; I think we took the best courses of action available to us at the time. The FAs were checked out by a med tech in the terminal after deplaning and as far as I am aware; no passengers required medical attention from the event.Safety of flight issues seem to be running rampant through the Airbus fleet. I've been involved in three myself in varying capacities. I can't imagine that there are no long-term effects from repeated chemical inhalation.I know that the installed oxygen masks are industry standard. However; compared to the simple military jet masks that I wore for ten years; these are horrible.",,"A321 Flight Attendant and Captain reported a fumes event during initial approach for landing.",

We taxied back to an available apron area to contact Dispatch and Maintenance Control to work on the issue.  After conferring with Maintenance Control we cycled the circuit breakers that Maintenance Control instructed us to cycle.  This did not fix the problem.  Upon further research Maintenance Control informed us that the issue could be deferred.  A deferral [was] made and a new release was sent to the aircraft.An uneventful takeoff and initial departure was made.Just prior to level off; the SPD LIM indication in the Captain's PFD was noticed to illuminate occasionally but only for a brief period of a couple-of-seconds.Level off at cruise altitude of 34;000 feet was uneventful.  All other indications and instruments were working properly; including all primary and secondary airspeed instruments.  As a precaution; we reviewed immediate action items; and follow on procedures of 'AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE' checklist.  At this time the only non-normal indications were a single channel AUTO SLAT FAIL light when the Master Caution recall was checked; and a very seldom intermittent SPD LIM  flag only on the Captain's PFD.  The First Officer was already the pilot flying so we continued with these flying positions.Once we were over the X area; the SPD LIM light illuminated more often and for longer periods of time.  It was more steady on; than off.  Soon thereafter we experienced a very brief (less than two seconds) 'stick shaker'; and very soon thereafter the Captain's PFD intermittently displayed brief over speed indications.  We again reviewed the Flight Manual and checklist for 'Unreliable Airspeed.'  At this point all of the First Officer's instruments were normal; all airspeed indicators agreed.We again contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and discussed the malfunction.  No resolution or fix was offered by Maintenance Control so the flight crew conferred and decided to divert.  After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance Control on the best divert options; ZZZ1 chosen.  As the flight continued to ZZZ1; all intermittent issues became more frequent.An uneventful visual approach and landing was made on Runway XXL at ZZZ1; followed by taxi to an available gate.  After maintenance made an initial assessment of the issues; it was decided by Customer Service; Maintenance; and Ramp to deplane the passengers and accommodate them all on a later flight to ZZZ.The only frustrating issue during the entire event was the fact that multiple ATC agencies (multiple Center controls as well as Approach Control) did not pass on to each other that we had [priority handling] and were an '[priority handling] aircraft!'  Center even tried to vector us north of ZZZ1 for 'at least 4 minutes!'I may not have initially checked onto the frequency as a [priority handling] aircraft; and not until I told Center that the vectors were unacceptable and that we were a [priority handling] did we receive priority handling.  Center apologized and said they had not been informed.

En route; we experienced a failure of DISPLAY SOURCE 1 on the Captain's PFD (Primary Flight Display). The Captain ran the QRH while I continued to fly. The QRH directed that the EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) be placed in ALTN mode; and that the Captain's Flight Director data was possibly unreliable. We then completed normal arrival preparations and continued. This failure was discussed with our Arrival Briefing going into ZZZ and was factored into our decision making. We began the arrival with ATC vectors around Cumulonimbus build ups and were vectored for the ILS Runway XX into ZZZ. As the aircraft leveled off; we were vectored for a base turn for the approach when the STAB OUT OF TRIM annunciator came on. The autopilot and autothrottles were disconnected and I hand-flew and manually trimmed; as the Captain re-configured for a Flaps 15 Approach and landing for Runway XX into ZZZ. At this time; I began to help the Captain complete the STAB OUT OF TRIM QRH and The Captain ran speeds for a Flaps 15; manually flown and trimmed approach and landing; along with brake cooling data for XX. Once we configured; the Captain called ATC; [requested priority handling]; briefed the flight attendants and made an announcement to the passengers over this Public Address System. I continued to hand-fly the vectors assigned by ATC and was vectored to the north of the airport for the RNAV GPS (Y) Runway XY Approach. I informed ATC we were not set up for the approach; but they advised us that Runway XX was closed. The Captain then re-ran a landing performance assessment for Runway XY; braking cooling data and loaded the approach for RNAV GPS (Y) XY.I continued to accept delay vectors and deviated around build ups. After we were configured and ready for the approach; the Captain assumed pilot flying duties and I took over pilot monitoring duties. I called ATC; advised we were ready for the approach; and we commenced. We completed the deferred before landing items out of the QRH; which included the Flap Inhibit switch being placed to INHIBIT and normal Before Landing Checklist. We were asked by ATC if we had the field in sight. We did and continued. Inside the Final Approach Fix ZZZZZ and at a 1000 ft. AGL; I made standard visual approach callouts. We were on speed and stabilized at 1000 ft. Only at the short final point; around 400 ft.; did I notice we were around 10 knots fast. The Captain noticed this and corrected; by reducing thrust all the way to the idle detent and we never lost the speed until touchdown. We braked normally; turned off the runway and had Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting meet the aircraft to check our brake temperatures. After we deemed it safe to approach the gate; XX; we heard on Tower frequency that another Company aircraft went around behind us; due to Windshear Warning and microburst activity was reported. The field was shut down to all arrivals and departures after this point. We parked normally from there. We handled the situation safely and coordinated duties that got the aircraft on the ground safely.",,"On a flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ; [priority handling was requested] while preparing to land at ZZZ. During cruise in a MAX -800 the 'Display Source 1' illuminated on my Primary Flight Display (PFD) and I accomplished the appropriate QRH Checklist. Completion of the appropriate QRH left us with possible unreliable Flight Director information on the Captain's PFD and the EEC (Electronic Engine Controls) were placed in the Hard Alternate Mode. To add to the Risk Factors the First Officer was on his IOE. We discussed the limitations of the aircraft and I decided we would plan to land on the longest runway at ZZZ (XX) to decrease the risk. The Captain's Roll Flight Director would bias out of view indiscriminately and using the longer runway with an operational ILS made sense. The landing was planned from the right seat. Additionally; the aircraft was near maximum landing weight and rain was in the area. The performance data indicated best stopping margin on XX versus Runway XY. With all those additive conditions and training considerations; Runway XX made the best runway of choice. While being vectored for Runway XX; with thunderstorms in the area; we began to configure for landing. After selection of Flaps 5 setting; the 'Stab Out Of Trim' Caution light illuminated. I accomplished the QRH. With the stabilizer not trimming I needed to accomplish the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative QRH. This Checklist put us into a manual trim condition with a Flaps 15 landing. I accomplished the Brake Cooling for Runway XX with positive results. At this point; the approaching thunderstorms advanced on Runway XX Approach corridor and ATC shutdown that approach. I had to run all the performance data for Runway XY. At this point; I [requested priority handling] and I prepared for Captain's landing on Runway XY. Thunderstorms were advancing rapidly on the field; and I was concerned with the field closure. Fuel was not an issue (10.3 on board with a bingo of 9.4) and ZZZ2 was the planned alternate. I advised the flight attendants of the issue and asked them to secure the cabin and I notified the passengers that there was an issue with the aircraft. I explained to the passengers that the aircraft was fine; but they would notice safety equipment around the aircraft; after landing; to check the aircraft. I explained my plan to taxi to the gate after the inspection by Safety Personnel. After completion of the brake performance calculations and performance data landing for flaps 15; wet runway and Stabilizer Trim Inoperative; heavy weight; I flew the Runway XY RNAV (GPS) Y Approach. Just as we began our descent on the approach; I had the runway visual with some rain on final. The approach and landing were uneventful. After landing I asked the Fire Department to check our wheel brakes for excessive heat; since our flaps 15 landing and aircraft weight had a final speed of approximately 170 kts. They indicated good temperatures; so I proceeded to the gate; but requested a truck follow me to the gate; just to be sure no residual heat would cause an issue. Literally minutes after landing; the field was closed; due to microburst from the advancing storms. After arrival to the gate (XX) I did address the Passengers with a basic overall explanation that they seemed comfortable with and with an understanding of the situation. No adverse comments from anyone. All additive conditions considered; I would have done nothing different. I did not know that the Display Source 1 issue would have affected my ability to trim the aircraft. If that was known to me I would have considered another landing option/airport.",,"B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported while preparing for approach; the aircraft alerting system displayed a reliability issue with the Captain's PFD and a Stab Out of Trim warning.

I asked if there was any smoke or fire. They said there wasn't but the smell was very strong and not dissipating at all. At this point I made the decision to request priority handling and divert to ZZZ. We turned around and started down and ran all of our checklist including the overweight landing checklist.  The I reached out again to the FAs and said I needed to know if any smoke started appearing at all. They said they would. They were given a priority code and we prepped for landing. Unfortunately with all that was going on I failed to notice they turned us in about 5 miles closer then I expected.  Due to this we ended up being much to high for the landing. Since we didn't have an actual fire at this point I felt it was safer to go around instead of forcing a bad landing.  We went around and then came back for a smooth overweight landing.  After landing we stopped on the high speed and I had the fire trucks position behind us and look for any signs.  I had the aft FA go back into the lav to check again.The strong electrical smell and the heat continued with no reduction in intensity. I told the Airport Rescue and Firefighting to stay close and follow us in as I felt it was safer at this point to deplane normally. I told them if we got any indication of smoke we would immediately stop and evacuate.  We got to the gate and again I felt it safer to remove all passengers thru the Jetway and then have the firemen inspect the lav. Upon inspection they found the water heater to be at fault and basically running away as hot as it would go. It was so hot that the hot water coming out was 130 degrees and even the cold water was 108 degrees. For reference the other lav showed 80 hot water. The end result was a safe landing with no evacuation needed. I did make the mistake of not realizing we were as close as we were so ultimately the only thing I would have done different would have been to verify how far out we were being vectored.  In the future I will attempt to look at that more closely. However a very strong mitigating factor was the possibility of this turning into a fire. Ultimately it did not luckily.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported cabin odor and walls in the aft lavatory were extremely hot; as reported by the aft Flight Attendant.

When following the Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM) procedure for the disagreement through FL210 we got an Adivsory indication flashing on the E/WD. The ENG page was up on the SD and QTY was flashing. The oil quantity was quickly decreasing from 3 qts. Within a few seconds while looking up the ECAM Advisory for oil quantity; I started noticing the oil pressure had decreased from 44 psi then started fluctuating from 30 psi to 25 psi and then started quickly dropping. The oil quantity indications had dropped and amber xx's replaced the indication. Within a few seconds the oil pressure dropped below red line and the Master Warning with repetitive chime came on. ECAM ENG 2 Low Oil PR appeared. We then proceeded to follow the ECAM actions. The ECAM directed us to shut down ENG 2. We then went through each secondary failure listed with the engine shutdown. After the engine was secured and preliminary ECAM actions were completed we stopped ECAM; leveled off at our assigned altitude of FL230 and I contacted ATC [requesting priority handling] due to having to shut down ENG 2. I requested to divert to ZZZ due to the facilities available and the longer runways. While talking to ATC the First Officer (FO) talked to the lead Flight Attendant (FA). ATC directed us to fly heading 150 and descend to 13;000 ft. We then ran the approach checklist and set the plane up for approach into ZZZ. The FO ran the landing performance for single engine Runway XXC. I requested Runway XXC due to the length of the runway. While I was flying and talking to ATC the FO was going through the FCOM procedure for ENG Low Oil PR ECAM.

At the same time; we quickly saw multiple amber Xs and screens flicker; but was too quick to see which ones. Shortly after we saw it again and it was clear that multiple relays seem to be malfunctioning; but more this time. I was able to see over the next couple occurrences that the TAT (Total Air Temperature) and SAT (Static Air Temperature) indicators; CA (Captain) outlet; FMGS1; ND1 (Navigation Display 1); VHF1 on FO (First Officer) side also went out temporarily. I called back to ask the FAs (Flight Attendants) if they noticed anything; and they hadn't yet; but on the third occurrence; they reported the WIFI and the lights were flickering. About the 3rd or 4th occurrence (they happened quickly in a fairly short span of time) that my FMGS1 was now out as well as the Fuel Used numbers were reset and Fuel used for engine 2 indicators also ambered out. At this point I had asked the lead FA to do a sweep of the cabin to see if they see or smell smoke or hear anything suspicious. I had remembered that a pattern of electrical anomalies can be a possible sign of electrical fire; so I had begun to plan for that. Shortly after the lead FA said that there was a strange buzzing sound over row XX (where the Wi-Fi is) and a strange smell of possible smoke. At this point while still on the line with the FA; I gave him a briefing; and as I had seen ZZZ as the closest airport; fortunately with maintenance as well; telling him that is where we are going; [advising ATC] (while coordinating with the FO who was the flying pilot). At this point; I had decided to prepare for a possible electrical fire; and we rapidly descended from our cruise altitude of FL370. We were about 10 min away and did our duties preparing for the landing; calling the fire trucks as a precautionary method. As electrical fire is a dire situation; I was not going to hesitate; as dispatch and Maintenance Control was not fully aware of what was going on; although I did briefly send a few ACARS messages explaining it. They had suggested ZZZ1; but it was about 30 min away. I called for ZZZ while dispatch/Maintenance Control coordinated well to prepare for the landing in ZZZ. We landed safely with a full stop on the runway; completing all SOPs. Fire trucks pulled the infrared sensors and noted no heat anomalies; and we were cleared to the gate. On arrival Maintenance Control stated they received a message from our aircraft that the ENG1 IDG (Integrated Drive Generator) had failed. We had not seen that message; and while it may have popped up briefly; I did hit the recall button multiple times showing normal during the events on the flight. We had deplaned immediately on gate arrival; fire fighters did a full infrared/temperature screening twice of the interior and exterior and found no heat anomalies.

The CA (Captain) pulled the speed brakes to get the thrust to come up to see if we would get any pressure which we did not. As we continued in the descent; we were at about FL220-FL200 and the cabin altitude horn came on. I checked the cabin alt and noted it was about 10;000 feet.

Temperatures returned to normal after reduction to climb thrust. Overheat ECAMs disappeared but ENG 2 OVERLIMIT ECAM appeared. We chose not to shut down engine 2 even though the ECAM procedure required it because engine 1 had also overheated and we were concerned that it could subsequently fail if placed under a high load which would leave us with no engines and the loss of XX souls. Diversion to ZZZ1 was uneventful. A deeper look into the aircraft history shows multiple overheats and a temperature over limit as well. Some reference to an EGT monitoring program can also be found in the logbook. Yet this dangerous aircraft; which should not even be flying; was sent to ZZZ knowing that the longer runway was closed and a high thrust setting would be required to depart. This is not an isolated case; I had previously refused to fly an aircraft with 5 overheats in the recent history in the logbook. I was told that our incident produced a temperature 1 degree shy of a mandatory engine change; yet the airplane was out flying the next day. What is Maintenance waiting for with these engines?

Upon climbout; we received an ECAM for ENG 2 EGT OVERLIMIT. I maintained control of the aircraft and assumed radio calls while the Captain started to troubleshoot the indication. After talking to Dispatch and Maintenance Control; we decided to [request priority handling] and divert into ZZZ1. Although the ECAM procedure directed an engine shutdown; after analyzing the situation; all parameters with the #2 engine were operating normal in the green so we elected to not shut down the engine; possibly creating further complications. The diversion to ZZZ1 was uneventful and Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) met us on the runway as a precaution to determine if there were any conditions requiring immediate attention. We were then cleared to taxi to the gate and subsequently deplaned. The closure of the long runway in ZZZ due to construction and the aircraft used by the company to complete the flight set up a chain of events that contributed to a situation prone to create an overtemperature condition in the engines. Taking off from a short runway with a maximum weighted; large; fully loaded aircraft in warm weather at maximum thrust with engines previously known for exceeding EGT limits put us in a perfect storm to have this event. This situation may have been prevented with some form of maintenance alerting software to prevent the equipment coordinator; Dispatch or Maintenance Control from sending this type of aircraft into an airport that would ask for such a maximum performance take-off until the engine could be changed or repaired.",,"A321 flight crew reported dual engine overheat during climbout.

We elected not to raise the gear as the aircraft was performing well and didn't want to make the situation worse by bringing loose tread into the wheel well. At about 800 ft the FA's called the flightdeck and I answered briefly to say that we blew a tire/everything was going to be ok and that we'd call them back. The F/O (First Officer) notified the Tower that we had indications of a blown tire on takeoff and requested a straight out departure.  Initially; I called for flaps up after accelerating at about 1500 ft AGL. Once the flaps were up the takeoff configuration horn alerted so we brought the flaps back to 1. During initial radar vectors; we advised ATC and stated that we'd need to return to ZZZ but needed time to coordinate and run checklists. The only other indication that we had of gear problems was the ANTI SKID INOP light was illuminated. I handed the control of the aircraft and the radios to the F/O so that I could make a PA to the Passengers; coordinate with ops; the FA's and reference the AOM/QRH. I made a quick PA and called the FAs; which was when I was told that a ceiling panel had come loose and injured 2 of our Passengers but that they were stable. We let ATC know we had injuries and provided the info that we had. At this point I referenced the AOM for landing gear tire failure on takeoff. I read the high points of that section to the F/O; so that we were on the same page; while waiting for ops to set up a patch with Dispatch. I was also busy coordinating with our F/As; Jumpseater (Company Captain) on how best to stow the loose ceiling panel such that I wouldn't impede egress. Subsequent to that; the Master Caution illuminated for the #1 ENG HYD LOW PRESS.  The F/O pointed out that the pressure was good but that the QTY was low and decreasing. Initially we elected to run the LOSS of SYSTEM A Checklist; figuring it was only a matter of time but decided to back out of that checklist since we still had good steady pressure even after the quantity read 0. We ran the #1 ENG HYD LOW PRESS checklist which directed us to turn off the pump. Once that was complete; we ran the Descent and Approach Checklists and asked for vectors to final. On about an eight-mile final; the Master Caution illuminated again; and we realized we were losing System A. We went around and asked for delay vectors again; while we ran the LOSS of SYSTEM A Checklist. Once that was complete; including performance data; we were vectored for landing. The landing was normal other than only getting one reverser and the shimmy from the blown tire. Directional control seemed normal; and braking was good; albeit slightly less than normal; which I expected. I had the F/O keep an eye on the accumulator pressure just in case. I also directed the F/O to start the APU. After slowing to about 30 knots and testing the tiller we told Tower we would exit the runway. I let the aircraft coast down the runway to exit. Upon slowing through approximately 20 knots; the aircraft started veering left and I couldn't maintain directional control. I stopped the aircraft as best I could with the nose ultimately 90 degrees to the left of centerline; but on the paved surface. B System Hydraulics registered 0 quantity. I then made a PA to the PAX to remain seated. Once the APU was on the busses; I shut down the engines and we started communications with CFR. They said there were no indications of fire; so we elected to keep the Passengers onboard the aircraft. The main thing we should have done differently is to have stopped straight ahead on the runway as expeditiously as we could have. I'm guessing the extra seconds we spent coasting down the runway was the time it took for the B System to lose quantity and pressure as well as the right brake to fail.",,"During rotation; left main tire blowout; causing partial loss of hydraulics.During rotation we felt what we believed was nose-wheel shimmy. The shimmy and vibration got quickly worse after liftoff; and we realized we had a blown tire. The Captain stated we had a blown tire and to leave the landing gear extended. We notified ATC that we possibly had a blown tire and would return to ZZZ. We retracted the flaps and got the takeoff config warning horn; so we extended the flaps to 1 to prevent the takeoff config warning horn from sounding; and we maintained about 190 knots. ATC climbed us to 6000 ft. We started to get vectored back to ZZZ. The Captain gave me the aircraft and radios; while he coordinated with the Flight Attendants and Dispatch. The FAs reported some Passengers had been injured by an overhead panel that had fallen down from the vibration. I ran the numbers and setup the FMC and radios for our return to ZZZ. The landing data stated would be landing about 14;000 pounds overweight; but due to the injured passengers we opted to land ASAP in the interest of passenger safety. We reviewed the AOM "tire failure on takeoff" items. During our delay vectors we got a 'hydraulic system A engine low pressure' caution light. We noticed that the system A quantity was about 30 and decreasing rapidly; we began to run the 'loss of system A' QRH; but decided since we still had hydraulic A pressure; we should just run the 'low pressure engine A' QRH.  We turned off the Engine A hydraulic switch per QRH.I made a PA announcement to the passengers explaining we were doing a precautionary landing due to what we believed was a blown tire. We told ATC we were ready to land. On final at approximately 2000 ft we received 'low pressure electric A' light.  We told ATC we needed to go around and run some checklists as we had just lost one of our hydraulic systems. We ran the performance data for "loss of system A" and ran the QRH for "loss of system A". We vectored around again. We turned on the "system A flight control standby rudder" and "alternate nose wheel steering". Upon landing; we maintained centerline and appeared to have directional control. There were heavy vibrations during the entire landing. Landing was normal until approximately 20 knots going straight down the runway; the aircraft started to turn to the left; the Captain stated the brakes and nose wheel steering were becoming ineffective; and the aircraft slowly came to a stop facing 90 degrees left; still on the runway pavement.  The Captain called the FAs and made a PA to remain seated. We started the APU and shut the engines down. We stowed the speedbrakes and extended the flaps to 40 to be ready for an evacuation if we needed to do so. Fire trucks approached the aircraft; they reported some smoke from the right main tires; and one of our right main tires was blown. They said they didn't see any need for an evacuation. Fire Department said the brake temps were approximately 390 degrees; and they would chock the tires. Fire dept chocked the tires and asked us to release the brakes. Approximately 15 minutes after stopping; airstairs were brought to the aircraft; and the EMTs came onboard through the forward entry door to evaluate the injured Passengers. After maybe another 15 minutes; three buses arrived; and we deplaned everyone into the buses.",,"B737 flight crew reported a blown tire on takeoff as well as a hydraulic systems failure that required a return to the departure airport.",

I pulled up the non-normals (757)(767) GEAR DISAGREE procedure on my EFB and the Captain requested a level off at 5;000 from ATC. We ran through the procedure up to step 6 and then the Captain transferred the controls to the First Officer and contacted Dispatch. After discussing the situation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control; we decided a return to ZZZ with an overweight landing was the best course of action and [priority handling was requested] at that time. As we began diverting back to ZZZ; the Captain took control of the aircraft back and I continued with the (757)(767) GEAR DISAGREE procedure but when we went to lower the landing gear; we received no down and locked indication for the right main gear. Ultimately; we were led to an alternate gear extension per the procedure but that still did not give us a down and locked indication on the right main gear; but the GEAR DISAGREE EICAS message blanked and was replaced with a R SIDE BRACE EICAS message. We broke off the approach at that time and requested vectors to give ourselves more time to continue trouble shooting the issue. At this point; the Captain once again transferred control to the First Officer and contacted Dispatch while I began searching for R SIDE BRACE in the FM (flight manual) but I was unsuccessful in finding the correct procedure because it is titled (767) SIDE BRACE - L (R). During this second discussion with Dispatch and Maintenance Control; they were able to direct us to the proper procedure for R SIDE BRACE which we accomplished but still did not resolve our issue. We also reviewed the Partial or Gear Up Landing Procedure. At this point; the Chief Pilot and Boeing Engineering where patched in and we were told to try several maneuvers including speeding up and slowing down as well as steep turns to attempt to lock the gear in place but nothing fixed the issue. We were advised to conduct a Tower fly-by and after completion; were told that ground crews could see all the landing gear extended but there was no way to confirm that it was locked. After the fly-by; we contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control for a final time to report that the gear appeared to be down and the decision was made to burn off as much fuel as practicable and then return to ZZZ for landing. About 30 minutes before landing we told the flight attendants to prepare for a [priority] landing and possible evacuation.

After takeoff; at approximately 300 ft. to 400 ft.; I noticed the #1 Engine EGT went red and indicated 968 degrees. I incorrectly stated we had an engine overheat because I saw the high EGT. At 1000 ft. after cleaning up the aircraft; I asked the F/O (First Officer) to pull out the QRH for Engine Overheat and as he looked at the index; he realized that it was a QRC item (as was the checklist we should have run: Engine Limit or Surge or Stall). We ran the Engine Overheat QRC and QRH. Everything with the wrong QRC/QRH went as I was expecting with the one exception of it having us retard the thrust lever all the way to idle rather than to the point where the indication went away as I was expecting; however; I clarified with the F/O that that was what it said; and we again failed to trap the error. The red indication went away shortly after reducing the thrust lever. We informed Tower we would be returning to ZZZ; due to a malfunction with our #1 engine. I notified the flight attendants of the situation and that we did not anticipate an evacuation. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them know of the situation and that we were returning to ZZZ. I also requested that they get us a gate. We had requested with ATC slightly extended vectors to Runway XX; in order to accomplish all the Non-normal and Normal Checklists and to set up and brief the approach and landing. We [requested priority handling] with ATC; so that the Crash Fire Rescue would be on hand; in case we had any further engine trouble and due to the fact that we would be landing overweight in a high ambient temperature of 99 degrees F. We decided to perform a 15 Flap landing in case we had to go around and had any further trouble with the #1 Engine; especially due to the high ambient temperature with a fully loaded aircraft. We also elected to use autobrakes 3. The landing was smooth; and we rolled out to Taxiway 1 at Tower's request; so that we could pull off into the de-ice pad for the fire trucks to inspect the aircraft. We ran the brake cooling performance data. We had to allow 30 minutes of cooling before returning to the gate. We coordinated with Crash Fire Rescue to shut down the engines so that they could chock the nose wheel for us to release the parking brake and help with brake cooling. At this point; we debriefed how we handled anything and as we reviewed the QRH again on the ground the F/O noticed that the indications section of the QRH showed the Engine Overheat lights and that that did not match our situation. This is when we realized we should have run the Engine Limit or Surge or Stall QRC and QRH. After the 30 minutes brake cooling; we coordinated to have the chocks removed and restarted the #2 Engine. Crash Fire Rescue followed us taxiing. We ensured Ground Personnel would be aware that #2 Engine would be running instead of the usual #1 Engine until we were stopped at the gate.After selecting the wrong QRC and continuing into the QRH; we should have re-verified the indications shown above the QRH steps. This would have shown us that we were in the wrong checklist. Additionally; I should have queried more than I did when I felt that retarding the thrust lever to idle rather than just until the indication went away. I should have had us re-verify the indications/condition section of the QRH. Lastly; I think consideration should be given to removing these two emergency checklists from the QRC and to only have them in the QRH. This would drive the first actions we take to be verifying the indications prior to following an initial wrong selection that gets us headed down the wrong path. Alternatively; I think adding the indications to the QRC; would help limit this kind of error.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported on departure one of the engines indicated a high Exhaust Gas Temperature.

The Captain immediately reduced power and lowered the aircraft's nose. While he did this; I advised center that we were leveling off at FL310 as I wasn't entirely sure if we were a [priority handling] aircraft at this point. The Captain called for the QRC for an engine compressor stall; and while I was looking for the checklist we were receiving a call from our flight attendants. At this point the engine appeared stable at a reduced thrust setting; so I answered the FA (Flight Attendant) call while the Captain advised air traffic control and got us a lower altitude. The flight attendant advised that they had smoke in the cabin; to which I responded we were working on the situation and would get back to them with more information. I informed the captain of the flight attendant's report and we decided to run the smoke and fumes QRH while diverting back to ZZZ. As there was no visible smoke in the flight deck; we both concurred that oxygen masks were not necessary. The Captain continued flying and working the radios while I ran the QRH.

The Captain was PF (Pilot Flying) and FO (First Officer) was PM (Pilot Monitoring). We were slightly high on base during vectors. PM stated "Captain we will need boards and flaps to get down". PF complied. We intercepted LOC and PM called it out. However; we never captured GS. As RFO I articulated "we are high; no GS" this was echoed by RFO2 stating "you're in ALT". The PM was also aware and told the Captain "if we are not going to be stable at 1k; we will need to go around." PF said "ok" and with AP (Autopilot) already off; decreased pitch slightly as an attempted capture GS. At that point no action was taken for several seconds except that slight descent and we were well above GS unable to make a safe landing (4 white PAPI and well above GS). The PM directed a go around around moments later at 1300ft. TOGA was not pushed and no words were spoken by PF. But the aircraft pitched up as Captain flying said something quietly. At this point the PM noticed the PF seemed to be low SA (Situational Awareness) after making callouts for the Captain that he missed. A moment later the FO stated "I have the aircraft" and started to execute the go around. This was the right call since we had hardly climbed and there were no commands from the Captain. I began filling in additional missed call outs as well as the FO. No thrust set call was made because TOGA had not been pushed. The FO was now doing double duty essentially. I did not see the thrust ref FMA or magenta reference on n1; so I began to fixate on the throttle position and speed. We got slow and I said "we are slow; add power." The FO turned off FDs at some point. A few seconds later RFO 2 said set climb attitude since the aircraft was now at 5NL. Next; we worked as a team to confirm heading and ALT by ATC. I noticed we were off and told FO " 20 right for heading." He has his hands full from the non standard go around; but immediately corrected the heading deviation. The Captain wanted to fly but we agreed the FO keep the aircraft and make the landing. At some point TOGA was pushed. The Captain believes he hit it at some point he admitted in debrief. I don't know when; but I believe this is what caused the 5NL attitude because of when we expected the go around and what we had set in the MCP. That is why I believe the FO had to turn off the FDs.Cause: Breakdown in crew communication (captain to FO).Solution: Brief go around procedures.",,"Captain and FO (First Officer) had the last rest. The other RFO and I swapped out with the flying crew to go change in the supernumerary at approximately top of descent; after having briefed the change over. We had loaded the ZZZZZ arrival and ILS YYR. The other RFO and I returned to the flying crew half way down the arrival. The FO mentioned a runway change back to XXL. On vectors to final and descending through approximate 8-10000; the FO verbalized to the CA (Captain) that we were high and suggest speed brakes to help descend. The CA was noticeably flustered; nervous; and seemed to shake slightly. We were at about 4;000 ft. on a base leg for about a 7-8 NM final. The CA disconnected the AP (Autopilot) and continued a descent to join final and cross the final approach fix a few hundred feet high. The vertical FMA went to ALT and the CA leveled at 1;800 ft. We were at 3 white and a red on the PAPI; but leveling at 1800 ft. resulted in the G/S indicator rapidly indicating we were again high. I announced that "we are in ALT mode and not descending". The CA again initiated a descent. The FO at that time announced "if we are not stable by 1;000 ft.; we are going around." At 1;300 ft. and still high/unstable; the FO announced "let's go around." The CA mostly leveled the airplane; but I did not notice the TO/GA button pushed and 10-15 seconds into the GA (Go Around); we were not climbing significantly. The FO was coaching the CA through GA call outs to get the aircraft flight path under control; getting flaps to 20 and calling positive rate. Without significant response by the CA; the FO declared; "I have the airplane" and took the controls. The FO had his hands full with a slow airplane from being level at 1;300 ft. The other RFO called "Push the throttle up!" The CA may have pushed the TOGA button after the FO took the controls; causing more confusion. At the same time I noticed our attitude 5 deg nose low and banked slightly left. I called "Set a climb attitude!" And the FO immediately pitched to resume a climb. The Tower assigned a climb to 4;000 ft. Our heading on departed drifted left 15-20 degree; the other RFO called this out for a correction; and the FO corrected. After stabilizing at 4;000 ft.; I called for getting the AP on and in proper FMA's; which the FO did. Approach gave us vectors for the approach. On downwind; the CA said "Okay; I'll take the airplane back." The FO stated "I think I should take this landing." The CA did not argue the point. The FO made an uneventful landing and the CA taxied back to the gate.Cause: The captain had mentioned he had not slept well on the flight and had not eaten much on the flight. It's possible that or some other medical issue could have played a factor in this crew member's breakdown in performance. He didn't seem the same as he was on departure. Solution: Good CRM can bring things back under control when things get undesirable in the flight deck. Sim training for go around at 1;000 ft. would be a huge help to the pilot group. We are most likely to GA at or above 1;000 ft. and those becoming a handful quickly.",,"Air carrier B777 flight crew reported lack of response from flying pilot on unstable approach resulted in Pilot Monitoring taking control of the aircraft for a go around and subsequent landing.",

I was the Flying Pilot of this flight. Climbing through FL210 with autopilot and autothrust on; we experienced a ENG 2 Compressor Vane ECAM. I monitored the aircraft and took ATC communications while the First Officer accomplished the ECAM. I leveled off at FL230 while notifying ATC that we were have an engine issue. We did not [request priority handling] at that point in time. Shortly after this ECAM while the First Officer was going through the ENG2 Compressor Vane ECAM; we received an ENG 2 FAIL ECAM. I subsequently [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center; and told them we needed to return to ZZZ. They responded quickly and gave us a turn back to ZZZ while we maintained FL230. The First Officer and I worked through the ECAMS and checklists associated with the above. As we were completing our checklists; the First Officer called the flight attendants to suspend the cabin service and advise them we were going back to ZZZ. I worked with ATC to give them information they asked for; souls on board; fuel quantity; etc as we progressed back to land. I briefed the flight attendants; told them that no prep of the cabin was needed; and that we should be on the ground in about 20 minutes. I made a PA announcement to the passengers and told them what had happened; what to expect; and that we were returning to ZZZ. ZZZ Approach set us up for a visual landing with ILS backup on [Runway] XX. A successful single engine approach and landing was accomplished. Fire/Rescue equipment followed us upon landing and inspected the aircraft after we cleared the runway. (We were approximately 6000 to 7000 lbs over max landing weight and the temperature was in the mid 90's so I requested they inspect our wheels as the brakes were quite warm.)We were subsequently cleared to taxi to gate with firetrucks in tow. ZZZ Operations gave us our gate assignment and we taxied to complete the flight. After the aircraft was secured at the gate and parking checklist was completed; the First Officer and I took a couple minutes to debrief ourselves before opening the cockpit door. I then went into the cabin to make an announcement to our passengers about what to expect. I was able to coordinate with the gate agents and operations and we then deplaned; the passengers to re-accommodate them. I then debriefed the flight attendants to check on them. After a short time; Company Maintenance arrived at the aircraft. Of note was one of the mechanics that came onboard and made a comment that we really didn't have any engine problem or damage and that "We've seen this kind of thing before." I thought that to be kind of an odd statement with the ECAM screen still showing ENG 2 FAIL.I can't speak for the First Officer; but I felt like he just blew off what had just happened with our aircraft.

Holding issued and Estimated Critical Fuel given. Dispatch advised of situation and fuel via ACRS. During hold ATC was extending Estimated Critical Fuel times. I advised ATC that I was diverting to my alternate based on my bingo fuel calculations (fuel was not critical). Dispatch advised; proceeding to alternate ZZZ2. ATC issued a heading. As we proceeded; we were IMC; in and out of the clouds with haze avoiding radar returns as needed. I was pilot monitoring and was getting set up for the new destination. The visibility suddenly improved and there was a build up In front of us that was not on the radar and we could not see before hand. We had no time to react. We experienced moderate to severe turbulence. Things happened VERY VERY quickly. We heard what I thought was hail and I told the FO (First Officer) to bank right. As we banked right I heard a loud bang and the left forward windshield shattered; and I [notified ATC]. I was given a frequency change and [re-notified ATC] stating that I need to descend to 10;000 FT. We were at FL230. I was concerned that I might loose the windshield and depressurize. We were given 9;000. We proceeded to ZZZ2 and landed without incident. I taxied off the runway and safety vehicles inspected the aircraft and runway. I taxied to the gate and the Passenger deplaned. There were no reported injuries to Passengers or Crew. I communicated with Dispatch and Company safety. He stated that the Director in ZZZ3 was going to call me. We spoke briefly and he requested a picture of the windshield and any other damage that may have occurred. No observed damage noted other than the windshield and picture was sent. Crew tracking wanted the FO and I to ride in car back to ZZZ to over night. The Director arranged for us to stay the night in ZZZ2. We proceed to the hotel. The XA:30 limo was a no show. I was on hold for an extended time with the hotel/transportation desk with no response and no vehicle contact information. I hung up and talked with the duty pilot and said I would get a rideshare to ZZZ4 to finish the trip.Cause: Unobserved build up and hail while in IMC conditions. No time to react when we became visual to avoid build up.Suggestions: As a new CA (Captain) flying with a new FO we were both very consultative on the decisions we were making i.e. weather avoidance and determining bingo fuel. We discussed all things as a crew. I am not sure of how this situation could of been avoided being we were IMC. We were using the tools that we had.

The F/O also noticed that the cabin altitude was 9800 ft. which is not normal. A search for the correct checklist ensued and shortly thereafter the cabin altitude exceeded 10;000 ft. which caused a high cabin altitude warning to annunciate. We donned our 02 masks and established crew communication via the intercom. The cabin altitude uncontrollable checklist was accomplished. I determined that the cabin altitude was uncontrollable based on the observation that both cabin outflow valves were indicating fully closed. I then determined that an expedited descent to 10;000 was required as the next course of action. [Requested priority handling] followed by a request for a descent to 10;000 ft. We were issued a series of step down clearances which resulted in attaining the requested 10;000 in a timely manner. The descent was accomplished using full speed brakes; idle power; and 310 KIAS. I requested holding at the ZZZZZ intersection so as to weigh our options. There was no apparent deficiencies of our aircraft and we had an abundance of fuel. There were no urgencies at this moment. I conferred with Dispatch; Maintenance Control; ATC; and the flight attendants. I made timely PA announcements. It should also be noted that no passenger O2 masks had deployed as we never reached the 14;000 ft. threshold level. Our timely descent precluded that. Prior to reaching 10;000; the IRO was called back from his break and arrived shortly thereafter. He then provided valuable assistance in our planning.While conferring with Maintenance Control via SATCOM; Maintenance Control stated that they desired we would have attempted to manually close the cabin outflow valves. Doing so; would have allowed the valves to close further he stated; possibly allowing the cabin to become controllable again. My own observations indicated the valves to be fully closed. The checklist we used asked a simple question as to whether the cabin was controllable or not.After consultation with Dispatch a decision was made to divert the aircraft back to ZZZ. The trip would be about 2 hours due to the low altitude. We had an abundance of fuel and an aircraft with no apparent defects. The weather at ZZZZ was 1/4 mi. visibility. We would jettison about 34;000 lbs. of fuel in order to be under our maximum landing weight. Exact information regarding the fuel dumping was sent to Dispatch using the text function of ACARS. While returning to ZZZ; I declined most ATC requests for priority handling. I believed that operating in a normal/routine manner was the best course of action. We then began working on low priority issues in regards to passenger comfort and amenities. We landed in ZZZ using autoland with me flying. While deplaning; I spoke with several Maintenance technicians who inspected our aircraft upon arrival. I was shown a picture of one of the external conditioned air inlets. This inlet was stuck in an open position. This would explain a great many things we observed. In my judgment there would be no way way of pressurizing the cabin sufficiently at a typical cruise altitude.I was very pleased with all who assisted us that night.",,,,"Air carrier flight crew flying B777 aircraft reported a malfunction with the pressurization system.

During the system review portion of the ECAM actions; we noticed that the entire Yellow hydraulic reservoir was empty and; consequently; the system was rendered inoperative.That became an area of concern to us; as the location of the hydraulic fluid became unknown and the potential for further complications was present. Additionally; secondary failures were associated with the loss of this system. ZZZ2 was three hours away; so it was quite evident to me that even though the aircraft did not suffer a controllability impairment; it was not at state that could be prolonged until reaching destination. Once the appropriate actions were completed; we computed the required landing distance for the present weight and reviewed the QRH procedures for overweight landing. I looked for potential diversion airports with runways longer than 8000 feet. There was a long area of severe weather to our left (south of our course) and the first airport that presented a long runway and was clear of weather was ZZZ. Jeep FD pro runway length filter and weather function; used in combination with the aircraft navigation display and onboard weather radar; was a great tool to enhance situational awareness and assist in the development of a plan. Subsequently; I transferred the radios to the First Officer and contacted Dispatch through Satellite phone and we established a three way communication with maintenance. I described the situation to maintenance and my decision was to divert to ZZZ. Maintenance advised the appropriate personnel at ZZZ and Dispatch provided me with weather and NOTAMs needed. A few minutes later a Yellow pump overheat was generated by ECAM and we completed the appropriate actions again.Then; I proceeded to call the Purser and informed her of the situation and the need of a Precautionary Landing. I made a public announcement and informed the passengers of a mechanical discrepancy that required us to land at ZZZ and the presence of safety vehicles upon our arrival.   The First Officer did a great job flying the aircraft; and preparing for arrival at our diversion airport. I resumed the operation of the radios and [advised ATC]; stating the reason for the diversion; souls onboard; fuel in minutes and airport requested. The First Officer and I reviewed the status of the systems affected one more time and discussed the threats present on this flight. I further reviewed the Overweight Landing procedures once again and proceeded to brief the approach.I informed the First Officer that I was going to perform the overweight landing; so I assumed the role of Pilot Flying and complied with the corresponding procedures. The First Officer reminded ATC of our status and the need of a tow track due to our inability to taxi off the runway.Once we landed; I advised the passengers to remain seated and that in just a few moments we were going to be towed to the gate. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was standing by; maintenance and ground personnel communicated with me via inter phone and they towed us to the gate. Once we arrived at the gate; I greeted the passengers and made the corresponding entries into the maintenance logbook.Once the passengers deplaned; I requested the Flight Attendants to have a debrief in which I shared the details of what happened; the reasons for the diversion; the importance of the system affected; and the tasks the we were performing on the Flight Deck. They shared with me what happened in the Cabin and we left to the hotel.I would like to point out that everyone involved in this mechanical diversion did an outstanding job. The First Officer supported me at all times while ATC provided the right information without introducing any additional distractions or workload. The Flight Attendants were calm and prepared the Cabin for a Precautionary Landing. ARFF was standing by at the right time and the right place. Ground personnel and Maintenance were waiting for us and accessed the runway to tow us to the gate expeditiously. The gate agents were standing by; connected the jet-bridge to the aircraft and deplaned the passengers without any delay. Contract Maintenance started to work on the aircraft immediately to open the cargo doors so the passengers' luggage could be accommodated.Finally; Technical support called me to discuss some details of the failure and I was positively impressed by the thorough and conservative approach they were planning on following. In other words; the positive outcome of this situation was the result of great teamwork.Great teamwork helped mitigate the risks associated with the problem encountered above.The cause of this event was maintenance related; so they will have the appropriate information to prevent it from happening in the future.",,,,"A321 Captain reported a hydraulic system malfunction resulting in a diversion to the nearest suitable airport.",

I was woken up when I heard "flight attendants take your jumpseats" which appeared to come over the PA into the bunk and the audio from the oxygen mask mic could be heard. I then sensed a descent initiate. A couple of minutes later once the flight attendants were asked to "check in" after reaching a safe altitude; I was then called back into the cockpit via the flight deck. Once I entered back into the flight deck I was briefed of the descent that had occurred as a result of a failure of the pressurization system and a CABIN ALT WARNING. I gathered my bearings and saw we were just outside ZZZZ at 9;000ft. We then started devising a plan together for a diversion and confirmed once again with the cabin crew to ensure everyone was okay and there was no visible damage to the aircraft that could've resulted in our issue. My role at this point as the Relief Pilot was to set up the communications via the SATCOM in preparation for the Captain to speak with Dispatch/Maintenance Control; I also monitored the flight path while the FO (First Officer) flew the aircraft. I commenced obtaining weather information via the sources on my ipad. We entered a hold before we made a decision where to divert. As a crew; along with the input from Dispatch and Maintenance Control we agreed that our best course of action was to return to ZZZ. An alternate of ZZZZ was not favorable due to weather. Once we commenced our diversion since we were overweight we then began the discussion regarding fuel dumping which we later coordinated ATC. We recorded the position and shared with our dispatcher. We then confirmed via our FOM diversion guide that we had considered all possible challenges that came with our situation. Upon arrival; Maintenance inspected the aircraft and advised "Both outflow valves closed; Maintenance confirmed initial findings (found ice in the air hook up; check valve broken and confirmed CABIN ALT WARNING)".",,,,"B777 air carrier First Officer reported pressurization system failure in cruise flight and returned to departure airport for uneventful landing.",

We ran the hydraulic pump low pressure checklist and positioned the switch off. After checking the hydraulic pressure and quantity indicators we saw the B system quantity was at zero. Knowing we would lose the remaining pressure in the B system we discussed available options and decided to return to ZZZ1. While coordinating with ATC we lost B system pressure and [requested priority handling]. We ran the Loss of System B Checklist; notified the Cabin Crew; Passengers; Dispatch; and ZZZ1 Operations of the situation and intentions. ZZZ1 was in visual conditions; so we requested Runway XXL for the length and ran the numbers for a Flaps 15 loss of B non-normal landing. Brake cooling data allowed us to park at the gate. We discussed all the inoperative items; requested a 10 mile straight-in to allow time to electrically run the flaps for appropriate configuration; and planned for an overweight landing. After landing we stopped on the runway to verify braking and nose wheel steering were operating normally and notified Fire and Rescue standing by that we would be able to return to the gate unassisted. After parking and deplaning Maintenance discovered hydraulic fluid leaking from draining holes in the tail section. On departure from ZZZ1 aircraft lost all system B hydraulics during climb-out/made safe landing back in ZZZ1.I don't believe there any ways to predict this kind of incident. The biggest take away for me from this situation was that we should have configured the flaps earlier at least to Flaps 5.

After a normal taxi and flaps 15 departure from Runway XC/[Taxiway] 1; we performed a NADP (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure)-1 climb out and initiated our flap retraction sequence at approximately 4;000 ft. MSL. As we retracted the flaps from position 1 to flaps up an EICAS message "LE SLAT ASYM" momentarily displayed; cleared and reappeared as we climbed through 6;000 ft. MSL. First Officer (PF (pilot flying)) continued the climb out to 12;000 ft. MSL maintaining the airspeed of 240 kts. making sure not to overspeed the flaps. I asked First Officer (relief pilot) to pull up the LE SLAT ASYM non-normal checklist. With the aircraft level at 12;000 ft. MSL; we began running the non-normal checklist and asked ZZZ Center for a holding fix to hold as we ran through our checklist. ZZZ Center gave us clearance direct to ZZZ1 VOR to hold. Having completed the non-normal checklist; I contacted Dispatch and requested to speak with Maintenance Control. I advised Maintenance Control we had an LE SLAT ASYM EICAS displayed and we had completed the non-normal checklist and asked if Maintenance Control had any further guidance regarding our situation. Maintenance Control informed us they had no further guidance to resolve the EICAS message which led us to the conclusion that we needed to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. We dismissed Maintenance Control from the phone patch; advised Dispatch that we [request priority handling] and were returning to ZZZ. At this time I asked First Officer (relief pilot) to notify the Flight Attendant; and give her the briefing regarding our [priority handling] and that we were returning to ZZZ. We asked Dispatch to verify our landing distance calculation which matched our calculation stating our landing distance required was 5;000 ft. At this point; we ended our phone patch with Dispatch and I made a PA to the passengers that we had a maintenance situation requiring us to return to ZZZ. We gave ZZZ Center/Approach our request to land Runway XXL (longest runway at ZZZ) and requested emergency equipment be available to the aircraft after landing. We also advised Air Traffic Control that our approach speed was going to be approximately 190 kts. due to our non-normal landing configuration and requested a 20-mile final to Runway XXL. We performed an uneventful flaps 20 approach and landing; clearing Runway XXL at Taxiway 2. We stopped the aircraft on Taxiway 3 and made contact with Crash Fire Rescue (CFR). We asked CFR to inspect our aircraft paying special attention to the brakes due to the 190-kt. touchdown speed. Our brake temperature indications peaked at level 6 and CFR stated the aircraft was in good condition and did not observe any indications of excessive heat from the brakes. We advised ATC we would like to continue our taxi to Gate XXX and CFR advised us they would trail the aircraft to the gate. After parking at XXX we performed the parking checklist and I advised CFR that we were parked and thanked them for their service. We had the main gear chocked; and released the parking brake to aid in the cooling. Upon opening the aircraft door; Maintenance boarded the aircraft where we debriefed them on the leading-edge slat asymmetry event. We wrote up the LE SLAT ASYM EICAS as well as the overweight landing (351;000 lbs.). At this time; I called the Chief Pilot and debriefed the event. I contacted Crew Scheduling who released us from duty.",,"Leading Edge SlatWhile climbing out of ZZZ and upon selecting flaps to UP; the LE Slat Asym EICAS caution illuminated. The flap needles were paired together halfway between UP and 1. I continued to fly and we reset the speed bug from 250 to 240 since the slats were partially extended. Passing 10;000; ZZZ Center gave us a climb to FL230 which we declined and were able to get 12;000. The Captain and relief pilot began running the LE Slat Asym checklist as we navigated to hold at ZZZ1 at 12;000. It became clear that we would have to return to ZZZ; so the Captain and relief pilot coordinated with Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and the flight attendants. I noted that we would have well over 6 hours of fuel at our current configuration and burn rate. I started a timer as we entered the hold to keep situational awareness on our time in the hold. After we finished the checklist; the Captain made a PA to keep the passengers informed or our status with the flaps not retracting fully and that we would be returning to ZZZ. I briefed the approach to XXL which is the longest runway. We calculated the landing distance with the QRH non normal table. We landed at about 351;000 lbs. which is above the limit of 320;000 lbs. It was a soft touchdown and the Captain called the speed at different intervals as we slowed down. We exited the runway where fire and rescue equipment checked our brakes for any signs of trouble. None was noted. The highest Brake level noted was a '6' on all wheels of the right main.

It was an EGT (1) OVERLIMIT message.  We immediately assessed the situation (I asked atc for present heading so we could work on the problem).  We proceeded to accomplish the ECAM actions after determining it was not a quick action item nor an ECAM exception.  The ECAM procedures had us eventually retard the number 1 thrust lever to idle; that did not do anything to help the overlimit situation so we ended up having to shut down engine #1 (per ECAM). At the same time we advised air traffic control and we're being vectored back to ZZZ to land on the longest runway (XXL). As I was checking for QRH follow ups; the captain was working on the FMS and also keeping the flight attendants/dispatch and passengers up-to date on what was happening.  Shortly after that we were cleared for the ILS XXL; landed without any further issues. After we landed we exited the runway; took a right turn and stopped where we were met by the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) trucks to have the engine examined and make sure there were no signs of fire/smoke or hot spots on the number 1 engine. After they cleared us we continued to taxi all the way to the gate.  We were in the air a total of approximately 40 minutes that day.

I pointed this out to the FO (First Officer) (pilot flying); and we continued with normal takeoff procedures. As we approached the bird's position; and the 80-kt. call was not yet made (my attention was focused primarily outside the aircraft); and it did not relocate; as we'd both later discussed was our mutual expectation. Instead; it stayed where it had landed; and only attempted to move as we came within perhaps one or two hundred feet. of it. As we passed its position; we heard and felt a significant impact on the left side; and we elected to abort the takeoff; expecting that damage had likely been done to the engine and/or aircraft at that point. With thousands of feet remaining; we rejected the takeoff by closing the thrust levers; using no reverse; having no autobrake actuation; and nominal/normal braking; and cleared the runway at roughly a midpoint high-speed taxiway; and returned to a gate; to learn that the number one engine had sustained damage.A large bird landing on the runway at or shortly after the time of our receipt of takeoff clearance.I do not recall being trained to consider the presence of non-fixed/mobile obstructions; animate or otherwise; as a reason to decline; cancel; or reject takeoff clearance or a takeoff maneuver; but I do recommend this becoming a training scenario/lesson; as I realize now that simply delaying our takeoff until the trespassing bird could be seen to have evacuated the runway environment would have almost certainly have precluded this incident. I will; from now on; never again attempt a takeoff with any obstruction; living or not; fixed or mobile; within the takeoff flight path.",,,,"B737-800 Captain reported a large bird on the runway prior to takeoff.

Just past ZZZZZ; and on course; we were slowing the aircraft and selected flaps 1 on arrival and approaching ZZZZZ1 on the RNAV RWY XX.  We experienced a MASTER CAUTION and HYD Annunciator message.  At that moment we had a Hydraulic B engine driven pump LOW PRESSURE light illuminated on the overhead panel.  We also looked at the lower display unit and saw that our HYD B quantity was at 0; We followed the QRH procedures and turned off the HYD B Engine driven pump.  Moments later we then received a Hyd B ELEC Pump LOW PRESSURE light along with a FLT CONTROL B LOW PRESSURE light.  Knowing that we then had a loss of HYD B system I [requested priority handling].  At that point I referenced the QRH of LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics (the FO was PF).  As events unfolded; we wanted to slow the aircraft and extended flaps 5.  We also put the gear down and selected flaps 15.  At this point we were past ZZZZZ1 and on an approximately 8-10 mile final descending and slowing.  I referenced the LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics and ensured we had ample runway available with the aircraft configuration.  Made a reference to the list of the inoperative items.  And made the determination to land with the runway insight.  I made the determination to continue the approach and land while considering the condition of the aircraft; the terrain of the surrounding airport; and thunderstorms in the proximity of the area and felt our (my) considerations had the greatest margin of safety for safely landing under the conditions.  As part of my considerations; I determined that it was the safest course of action to continue the approach without completing the entire QRH procedure for the LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics.  Our flaps were selected to 15 but because of the loss of system B they only extended to approximately 12-13 degrees.  I determined with reference to the landing data that without the extra 2-3 degrees would still safely allow us ample landing distance.  I took control of the aircraft and landed.  We were met by airport emergency equipment.  We taxied to the gate and deplaned uneventfully.  Cause: We had a loss of hydraulic B system while on arrival into approach.  We had been flying around thunderstorms and into an airport that had terrain considerations.  Because of where the event occurred (as far as where we were on the approach; altitude and airspeed) we had very little time to make decisions.  And my decision was the safest course of action was to continue and land as we were a priority aircraft flying into and airport that was terrain challenged and had thunderstorms in the area.

Climbout continued as I noticed the left fuel tank quantity rolling back like a countdown timer with the center and right tanks remaining stable. QRH for 'Fuel Imbalance' procedures were followed up to shutting down the left engine. We paused there since we were turning final for Runway XXL at ZZZ and the aircraft was stable and the imbalance was no longer increasing at a rapid rate. After landing we shut down the left engine and allowed ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to examine the aircraft. ARFF crew verified fuel was not leaking; we single engine taxied to the alley and towed to gate with ARFF supervision. The maintenance crew informed me that they had been called out by the fueling crew for an imbalance condition before the flight however when they arrived the fuel was properly loaded. Cause: Unknown. Post flight review indicates that both engines were being fed by the left fuel tank with all pumps on and cross feed closed. Suggestion: Unknown cause. Early recognition and starting the checklist before getting the fuel imbalance indication maintained the aircraft in a controllable configuration.",,"Shortly after arriving to the airplane to start the day; 2 Maintenance members came on the plane and asked me about a fuel imbalance that they received and were called out to check on. All three of us looked at the fuel quantity that was already put on the airplane and it showed the correct amount of gas that we needed for the flight and it was balanced and checked out fine. When everything was finished with boarding and the front door was shut; we pushed back like normal and taxied to [Runway] XXR for departure. Shortly after departure; the Captain was flying and noticed that the plane was requiring a lot more rudder and aileron to keep the airplane flying straight. Shortly after departure; the fuel imbalance indication came up on the left fuel tank which got both of ours attention for which we saw a super fast decrease in fuel coming from the left tank. We continued the departure while we started to decide what we wanted to do. I got into the QRH with the Fuel Imbalance Checklist and proceeded with the checklist. We got all the way up to "shutting down the engine" and stopped because we were already turning back to ZZZ and we made the decision to not shut it down because we were close to the airport and had plenty of fuel in the tanks. After doing the checklist; the decrease in fuel was finally stable and was not decreasing like it was before. We [requested priority handling] and landed on XXL and came to a full stop. The ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) trucks approached the airplane while we were stopped on the runway to make sure we weren't leaking fuel and everything was safe. After getting the ok from ARFF; we taxied into the gate with ARFF following us all the way. Cause: The 2 Maintenance team members came onto the airplane right after I got on the plane to ask about a fuel imbalance that they received to come out and investigate. After all 3 of us looked at the fuel quantity and seeing that it was full and balanced; they left and I started doing my preflight tasks. After departure and the fuel imbalanced came up with the amount decreasing so rapidly; it made things weirder that the fuel was imbalanced during refueling; showed fine on the ground; and then became imbalanced again in the air. Suggestion: Ask more questions when the Maintenance members came out to investigate a fuel imbalance call. They came and saw it was fine and all 3 of us were ok when we saw it fine. I should have asked more questions about who reported the fuel imbalance; when did the person see it was imbalance; and did the completed fueling cause the fueler to see it fine and then leave.",,"During departure climb air carrier flight crew reported the left fuel tank showing a high rate of fuel consumption compared to the right tank.

The Captain (CA) Pilot flying (PF) called their aircraft and radios. The First Officer (FO) (PM) followed the ECAM and checklist. After about 30 seconds another warning alarm sounds. The second time the ECAM displayed pitot fail AOA fail. Simultaneously the airspeed tape and altitude tape showed erroneous information and the standby attitude indicator read zero. The CA turned off the auto pilot and auto throttles and maintained a constant decent. The FO had [requested priority handling] and requested speed and altitude calls from ATC to crosscheck desired performance. Cautions and warnings continued to sound every few minutes with ECAM. This created a very distracting and loud cockpit. As we descended below 14000 ft. it seemed that the instruments became more reliable. The crew continually crosschecked with ATC for confirmation. At about this time the Flight Attendant called the cockpit to inform the crew about an unresponsive passenger. While on vectors ATC reported extreme precipitation on final; they then said the heavy precipitation was gone. While getting on the LOC course the aircraft was still high and was directed by ATC to level off at 3000; and that we would be executing a missed approach. The crew received vectors and landed the aircraft on Runway XXC. Once on the ground the crew taxied to the gate/jet bridge. EMTs came on board and the previously unresponsive passenger awake and responsive once on the ground. Cause: IMC weather conditions; multiple alternates with similar weather as ZZZ icing conditions; multiple systems failures; backup systems failures. Suggestion: I see no actions that could have prevented it. There were a few actions that were omitted due to the extreme situation. Although the crew alerted ATC of the situation the crew forgot to squawk 7700. The crew followed all checklist and procedures and prioritized well.",,"While descending as Pilot flying (PF) into ZZZ; about 25000 ft; IMC; anti-ice on; the aircraft had a master caution alert indicating a Captain pitot heat fail ECAM. I confirmed "my aircraft" and asked the First Officer (FO) to run the ECAM which they did. Within 30 seconds or so; we received many follow on master caution and master warning alerts for a couple of minutes. As soon as we would silence the bells; new ones would alert. ECAM was indicating all pitot heaters had failed and we received AOA failure alerts as well. This resulted in the failure of all airspeed indicators; they went to 0. Altimeters and VSI were fluctuating and appeared to be unreliable. We made a [request for priority handling]; altitude and descent rate from ATC. I disconnected the auto pilot and auto thrust; then set pitch and power to continue the gentle descent that we had set previously. We were able to confirm with ATC as we continued the descent that the altimeters seemed to start working reliably again. Our intent was to get into warmer air to get airspeed and VSI back. We knew the temperature at ZZZ was 15C or so. We requested and were granted vectors to ILS XXC for approach. Weather was 1100 overcast and 3 miles visibility with showers in the vicinity. Weather at ZZZ1 and ZZZ2 were no better with gustier winds. We continued running the ECAMs; trying to make sense of it all. FO was also continuously backing me up on instruments. Upon finishing the checklists; we were in alternate law and finally got airspeed and VSI back. Then we got a call from #1 Flight Attendant (FA) that they had a medical emergency in the back; an unresponsive passenger. I replied we had an [priority] up front as well; they would have to handle it; landing in 10 minutes. We notified ATC of the additional issue and requested medical attention at the gate. We got the aircraft slowed and took vectors to base leg. ATC then reported moderate to extreme precipitation; ahead and just right of course. I was trying to corroborate that on the radar while FO requested vectors around it. After a long pause ATC replied the radar return was now gone; and turned us to intercept final. While handling all that and finishing configuration I overshot the localizer and started back to the right to intercept. ATC gave us a go around from about 2900 ft. which we completed. Second ILS and landing went fine. After landing; we taxied to the gate and it took another 5 or so minutes to get the jet bridge working. Once connected; EMT's boarded and medical assistance was rendered to the passenger. They were conscious before landing according to the FA's and feeling better as they deplaned. We were IMC from the start of the problem until we broke out at 1100 ft. on final. We were in light rime icing until about 15000 ft. (estimated); then we regained airspeed and VSI indications; one instrument at a time. I maintained aircraft control by constantly cross referencing all of the instruments to check for reliability; taking input on checklist items when able; and ignoring all other distractions. It was a full time job. I made gentle changes to pitch; roll; and power until we were able to jointly agree; with ATC providing ground speed and altitude calls that we were getting the performance from the jet we wanted. Once we got lower; we started trusting the instruments again as they seemed to be working normally. FO's backup on this was very helpful. They did a fantastic job helping with instrument scan and providing verbal updates; getting us through the ECAMS; and assisting with comms. For a XX hour; new hire FO; they were impressive. The Flight Attendants also deserve recognition for handling the medical situation in the back. The #1 FA heard all of the warning and caution alerts so they knew something was wrong up front. They remained calm and they carried on admirably with what little information they had. The FO and I had 100% of our attention on flying the jet and landing safely. Cause: Multiple cascading failures contributed to a confusing and difficult situation. Suggestion: I recommend all pilots ensure they are comfortable completely hand flying an instrument approach. I flew jets for XX years and we hand flew all the time. That came in handy today; even XX years later.",,"A319 pilots reported multiple instrument malfunctions during descent.

On climb-out; around 10;000 ft. the mini-engine display appeared and the oil quantity indicator on the right engine began slowly counting down from around 80. During the oil quantity decline; there were no other indications of an engine event; other than the quantity being highlighted white. No oil pressure light or indication; oil temp or vibration coming from the engine. We continued the climb to our final cruise of 19;000 ft. and reviewed the QRH in preparation for the event that something might happen. The QRH references that the LOW OIL PRESSURE light may or may not be illuminated. During the whole event we did not see the OIL PRESSURE light illuminate. We ran the one step for ENGINE LOW OIL PRESSURE which refers you to the Engine Failure Checklist if the pressure is at or below red line. The pressure was still within limits - green - and had not declined at all from the comparable left engine pressure.The quantity continued to count down and when it got to around 20%; we asked for priority handling to ZZZ1; a shortcut; but we did not declare an emergency. We were given direct ZZZZZ for the RNAV XXL or somewhere thereabouts and we were given a descent. It was around then that the oil quantity indicator reached 0%; still with no other indications. The QRH was on the dashboard; opened up and ready to go. During the initial descent; the oil quantity actually counted back up to 20% and fluctuated up and down. We got the ATIS and landing data for ZZZ1 Runway XXL and briefed a Flaps 40 visual landing. The landing distance available for Flaps 40 was around 1;400 ft. with brakes MAX; wet runway. It was very visual conditions in ZZZ1 with a light wind out of the west and a 5-WET GOOD field report for Runway XXL. We briefed the arrival and approach and ran the Descent and Approach Checklists.  It was around this time that the oil pressure indicator on the mini display rapidly went to zero. The mini display rapidly flashed white; then amber; then red and the engine temperature began to climb on the mini display. Captain called for the Engine Shutdown Checklist and [asked for assistance] with ZZZ1 Approach. The Shutdown Checklist went uneventfully. We were below 10;000 ft. at this time and we may have exceeded the 250-kt. speed limit; but neither of us could recall by what small margin and for how long. We had five hours of fuel onboard - we were tankering 15;000 lb. We briefed the flight attendants and made an announcement to the passengers.By this time; we were on the approach for [Runway] XXL and had ZZZ1 in sight with a single-engine configuration. We ran the landing data for a single-engine landing on [Runway] XXL and noticed that the landing distance available was an acceptable margin with the very favorable VFR conditions. We discussed diverting to ZZZ2 and agreed upon continuing the approach to ZZZ1; with the plan of executing an early missed approach to [Runway] XXL if we were uncomfortable or outside the parameters of a stable approach with the plan of immediately diverting to ZZZ2. The approach; final approach; and landing were normal. We touched down with brakes MAX and exited Runway XXL at our normal exit for this runway. We taxied to the Ramp and had Crash Fire and Rescue inspect the engine for heat or damage - there was none - and continued in to park at the gate.In conclusion; I am proud of the way this event played out. I was comfortable with our plan to continue the approach considering both my experience and Captain's; not only with the 737 but also with flying into ZZZ1. We had discussed all options and eventualities within the short time available and I was satisfied with our "Plan B" as well as a "C."This event unfolded very slow but with a very rapid conclusion. It very much reminded me of the loft where we had to decide rapidly between ZZZ3 and ZZZ4 with a fire on board.

I (FO/First Officer) was the Pilot Flying. Our cruise altitude was filed 39;000 ft. but we chose to maintain 37;000 ft. for a time in order to avoid a less desirable ride condition at 39;000 ft. for a short time. At 37;000 ft. in visual meteorological conditions; about 30 miles northeast of ZZZ2 airport; the R1 (FO side front) windshield developed a spidering crack engulfing most of the glass. The Captain and I noticed the malfunction and he immediately took control of the aircraft; and I requested a lower altitude with ZZZ Center; which they granted to 25;000 ft. accompanied by a left turn about 40 degrees left due to traffic below us. A short time after we were cleared back enroute now at 25;000 ft. Once established in the descent with the Captain at the controls he asked for the associated QRH. Upon running the QRH we were able to determine with our own physical touch the affected windshield pane was the outer pane. The QRH allowed us to continue to the destination if desired. We also [requested priority handling] with ZZZ ARTCC.With the aircraft under control; the Captain returned aircraft control to me; and they consulted the AOM for guidance on determining how to technically tell which pane of the windshield is broken. This is where some confusion with the guidance came in. After both the Captain and I read over the instructions multiple times our original thought that it was the outer pane stood but the wording on the instructions wasn't exactly clear.We started hearing another unidentified noise coming from the area around my oxygen mask. It sounded like some kind of airflow and both of us could clearly hear it and identify it as something that sounded abnormal. Although no noticeable pressurization abnormalities were occurring at the time; we chose to request a lower altitude in order to mitigate issues if a slow pressurization issue was occurring. ZZZ ARTCC granted us 14;000 ft. We were able to alert the Cabin Crew there was an abnormality. The Captain and I decided to divert to ZZZ3; as it was closer in front of us after running the QRH and AOM guidance. This decision was derived from the only acceptable airports being ZZZ1; over the Mountains and ZZZ4 prior to more mountains. ZZZ3 was decided for distance as well as Company presence and current altitude. We alerted the Passengers of an issue with the aircraft that could affect pressurization so we will be diverting as an abundance of caution. As we prepared for the new approach to ZZZ3 I noticed part of the black seal around the right side of the windshield was detaching and flapping freely in the wind. The Captain conducted the approach and landing as my windshield was obscuring my view and the rest of the approach was uneventful. Airport rescue and firefighting equipment met us upon landing. We taxied to the gate with no further issues noted.  The wording could be modified in terms of how to determine which pane (inner and outer) is affected. The pointed object on the window and moving to determine if the crack moves was confusing to me; and also to the extremely experienced Captain I was flying with.",,"We had an event flying at FL370 from ZZZ to ZZZ1. After a 'pop'; our R1 windshield instantaneously exhibited excessive cracking. Not knowing the extent of the damage; and a possible pressurization event; I asked ATC for an immediate lower altitude until we had a chance to diagnose the problem. Cabin pressurization did not change. ATC was swamped working multiple frequencies and initially did not want us to descend due to traffic. After stating that we would take a turn to descent he eventually gave us clearance to a slightly lower altitude. After trying to get much lower; ATC implied that the only way we would get it in a timely manner would be to [request priority handling]. We did so and were finally able to get a much lower altitude. During the descent; I had my FO (First Officer) accomplish the 'Window Damage-Forward' QRH. Upon executing the checklist; we came to the decision tree in which you choose damage to either the outer pane or inner pane.  There was no information on how to determine that; so we referred to Section 5.2.1 Window Damage; of the Non-Normal section of the AOM for an amplified explanation. Upon reading that section; both FO and I took several minutes trying to interpret the meaning of the 'pencil test' to determine inner or outer pane damage.  That language is confusing and not intuitive at all. Eventually; we determined that we had outer pane damage and completed the rest of the QRH. After sharing 'mental models' and applying RRM (Risk Resource Management); we came to the determination that diverting to ZZZ3 was the best solution to minimize unnecessary risk. We landed successfully and without incident. There is a detailed summary of our decision making process and more amplifying information on a report that I also submitted for this incident. Several things could be improved upon for any future people that might encounter this situation.  AOM Window Damage - the summary describing how to determine if windowpane damage is inner or outer is very confusing and not very well written. Both my FO and I read it several times; wasting precious minutes on how to determine whether the damage is inner pane or outer pane.  This determination is absolutely crucial as it defines a decision branch point in the QRH - both with vastly different outcomes. For something so critical in a checklist; more information/emphasis needs to be written in this section or better yet; incorporate it into the QRH where it is easily accessible. Since this is so crucial and somewhat time critical; perhaps the first step on the 'Window Damage-Forward' might be to start a descent until a determination is made whether it is inner pane or outer pane damage. Also; maybe consideration should be to make this a new QRC checklist item? There are also other ways to determine inner pane vs outer pane than just the complicated 'pencil test'. After landing; the Maintenance person told us to look at the crack and see where it intercepted the window frame. From there it is apparent whether it is inner pane or outer pane damage. Perhaps in the AOM in this section; or somewhere else in training; show pictures delineating an example of inner vs outer pane damage. Pictures are always great visual learning tools. General unhappiness with ATC. I've noticed a degradation overall of ATC services in the U.S.; post-Covid. ATC Personnel are less qualified; less experienced; and generally seem to be very 'snappy'; short-tempered and not pleasant to deal with.  Talking extremely fast - a 'mile a minute' - while doing a transcon from coast to coast is very fatiguing for us Pilots.  ATC is often working multiple frequencies; and is unable to give good service; while we are only hearing part of the conversation. The initial; high ATC Person working our event at FL370 is one example of this general degradation of service.  He was task saturated and more or less forced us to [request priority handling] earlier than I had liked to in order to get a lower altitudein an expeditious manner. All of ATC needs a total revamp. The service is not good; most of the Personnel are inexperienced; overworked; and have short tempers and unpleasant attitudes when working with Pilots. Some of them (none on this event) are borderline unprofessional.  Please compel the FAA to spend more money on Air Traffic Control Services!",,"B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported the cockpit windshield cracked inflight at FL370.

After rotation; the pilot flying (FO) called for landing gear up. The landing gear was raised immediately; and within 2-3 seconds; the tower called to inform us that we were trailing a significant amount of smoke from what appeared to be one of the engines (We later learned that it was actually hydraulic fluid from the right landing gear well when a line separated; and it completely depleted the green hydraulic system in a short amount of time).  At that same time there was a noticeable load rumbling.  We were approaching 3000 feet and the CA (Captain) asked Tower to level off. Almost immediately; we begin getting ECAMS. The first one was HYD green reservoir low level. Then almost immediately L/G doors not closed with associated warnings and other associated warnings about gear; spoilers; airspeeds; etc.  After reviewing the QRC and determining that this condition was not an immediate action or ECAM exception.  the CA assigned the me to continue flying duties and I directed ECAM actions.  I informed the Tower that we would need to return immediately and the CA set up the MCDU (Multipurpose Control Display Unit) for an immediate return with ZZZ as the new destination; I configured the box for an approach to runway XXR at ZZZ. Tower switched us over to departure for coordination.  The CA [requested priority handling] with Departure and requested equipment meet us upon landing.  Departure allowed us to fly a long downwind with speed at our discretion while we analyzed and addressed our situation and took appropriate actions.The CA commenced the ECAM instructions and turned off the green hydraulic pump then the PTU (Power Transfer Unit); and other actions per the ECAM. We received vectors back to runway XXR.  We had a jump-seater who was a new hire Pilot who had just finished OE (Operating Experience) and had considerable Airbus experience. He assisted us by performing a landing assessment and raising our attention to details on the ECAM; He was actually very helpful. We all remained calm and completed configuring and discussed the systems we had lost including spoilers 1 and 5; reverse on number one engine; normal brakes ( no Anti-skid); auto braking; and components on the green hydraulic system. We reviewed all the systems Lost and the status pages; then commenced with descent checklist; and before Landing Checklist configuring with full flaps. FO flew a normal approach and reported the controls felt a bit "mushy". Weather was not a factor with light winds. The FO landed in the normal landing zone initiated reverse with the one engine reverser; and immediately began breaking. We cleared the runway at taxi way 1 and were met by the emergency responders. Parking brake was set and after the APU was started; we shut engines down and asked for the fire chief to visually evaluate our condition. He reported hydraulic fluid was leaking and puddling below the aircraft but mostly out of the right landing gear.  There was no smoke or indication of imminent fire so we allowed the fire department to more thoroughly assess and decided to get towed back into the gate. We were approximately 3000 pounds over max landing weight (Maintenance control was notified and a report submitted for overweight landing) and we did a quick review of the overweight Landing QRH to include go around considerations.  Once maintenance arrived at the airplane with a tug we retrieved the landing gear locking devices and nose gear pin; and dropped them out of the flight deck window; avoiding contact with the aircraft.

We ran the QRH Checklist Transfer Bus Off. As we were progressing through the checklist; the #1 Transfer Bus Off light was becoming more frequent and more persistent. In accordance with QRH; we confirmed we were in operational limits to start and use the APU for electrical. The limit is 41;000ft. and we were at 39;000ft. We started the APU and put the #1 bus on the running APU. This worked for a number of minutes; and we completed the checklist; notified Dispatch and in accordance with QRH; planned to continue to ZZZ1. The APU accomplished an auto-shutdown; and the provided power fell offline. In accordance with 737AOM; APU limitations; we attempted to start the APU again. It stayed on for about two minutes; then auto-shutdown again. We returned to the QRH and followed the APU is not available branch. This directed us to plan to land at the nearest suitable airport. At this point in the flight; the nearest suitable airport in terms of distance; time; Maintenance; and Passenger care was assessed to be ZZZ2. A divert to ZZZ2 was conducted. Looking back; I probably should have gone ahead and [requested priority handling]. No special handling was required; but had the situation turned for the worse; it would have been good to have that. If I'm solving problems with the QRH; serious consideration should be given to [requesting priority handling]. Also; to prevent landing overweight at our nearest suitable airfield; we accomplished a turn back to final to be burn a few hundred pounds of gas to be within aircraft weight limits. Consideration should have been given to accepting the slight overweight landing and follow-on inspection; in order to expedite landing. At the time; I was thinking not to further complicate an already complex situation.",,"In cruise at FL390; I was the PF (Pilot Flying); Captain PM. The Master Caution started flickering on and off but too fast to actually see what it was. Over time we saw what the light was; so at XA:30 we ran the QRH for transfer bus off. We were in limits of running the APU so we turned it on and it extinguished so we thought it was the end of the procedure. We notified Dispatch that the QRH procedure had been performed and we needed fuel numbers for the running APU. Gave them current fuel on board. At XB:40 source Off light came on; same side; number one. We noticed the APU had fallen off line. We tried to start it again and for a few minutes it ran but at XC:43 fell off line again. We looked at the same procedure again for if the APU was not available and also being single electric source; we diverted to ZZZ2. Upon arrival into ZZZ2 we saw we were roughly 500 pounds heavy. On a right base; we did a right 360 turn to burn it off and we landed under weight in ZZZ2. We could have descended to a lower altitude and tried the APU a third time. Maybe next time I'll do that. We figured there could have been a bigger electric issue that was unknown. We didn't [request priority handling] and probably would next time to be safe in case we did end up losing the last good generator. Next time we could have landed overweight just to get on the ground but we didn't want to add another issue on top of the current problem.",,"Air carrier flight crew flying 737 aircraft reported electrical system malfunction inflight.

Myself; and a Flight Attendant were the first ones on the aircraft. I proceeded straight to the flight deck and began my originating flow. I powered up the aircraft and noticed that Captain had arrived. I then exited the flight deck and made my way to the ramp to perform my walk-around. The aircraft set up and departure planning took place as normal. Push-back and engine start took place normal. Once cleared for takeoff; we departed on the ZZZZZ Departure. Captain made a comment about the rate of climb. The aircraft was able to achieve. We made mention of how light the aircraft was with only XX Passengers on board. We climbed via the SID to 8;000 ft.; then were given 14;000 ft. by ATC. Climbing out of 10;000 ft.; we read the Climb Checklist and as we verified pressurization; the Captain made a double look; and notably appeared to notice something not right.Right about that time; the Cabin Altitude Warning light illuminated; and the horn sounded. Captain verified he had the controls and radios then instructed me to read the QRH. Captain stopped the climb at about 12;000 ft. and [requested priority handling] with ATC while requesting a lower altitude. We then proceeded with the QRH procedure without issue. ATC provided headings and altitudes as we planned for our arrival back to ZZZ without incident. Upon landing; coordinated a gate with Ground; Ops; and returned to park.When Maintenance came aboard to ask questions; I was unable to answer questions with absolute certainty concerning bleed positioning and pack usage.

The Captain (PF) took control of the radios in addition to the aircraft. He advised Air Traffic Control that we needed to level off to run a checklist. I (PM) ran the Landing Gear Fails To Retract non-normal checklist which led us to the (NG) Gear Disagree non-normal checklist. That led us to open and close the manual gear extension access door. Upon doing that it was noted that the door was not completely flush with the floor which; we believed; indicated it was slightly ajar at the time of attempted gear retraction. After opening and closing the manual gear extension access door; as directed by the checklist; and moving the landing gear lever to DN; then UP we showed the red nose gear Landing Gear Indicator Light illuminated. The checklist then led us to "Flight with gear down increases fuel consumption and decreases climb performance.'The Captain and I agreed we did not have the fuel to continue the flight to ZZZ1 and the best option was to return to ZZZ. We moved the landing gear lever to DN and received all green Landing Gear Indicator Lights. If we were to immediately return to ZZZ we would have to accomplish an overweight landing. Since the Landing Gear Indicator Lights were illuminating all green and nothing else was of urgency; we decided to hold and burn enough fuel to be within landing weight limits. We advised air traffic control of the updated situation and held until we were within landing weight limits. Once we were within landing weight limits we returned to ZZZ for a normal landing and taxi to the gate. Crash; Fire; Rescue trucks were dispatched and followed us into the gate as a precaution. The Dispatcher; Air Traffic Control; flight attendants; and passengers were updated multiple times; as necessary.",,"On departure from ZZZ RWY XXR; the landing gear failed to retract. After the gear handle was raised; all red and green GEAR lights were illuminated.  We continued a slow climb and retracted the flaps and maintained approximately 230 KIAS.  We advised ATC and [requested priority handling].  We got clearance to level off.  We referenced the flight manual Non-Normal procedure Landing Gear Fails To Retract. With our indications directed us to the Gear Disagree checklist. With our indications; we followed the checklist.  We opened and closed the manual gear access door and verified it was fully closed. When the FO did this he noted it appeared slightly ajar before he cycled the door.  After cycling the gear handle; the main gear showed normally retracted (all lights out) but a red light remained for the nose gear.  This condition led us to the next step which indicated we would have that gear stuck down and therefore increased fuel consumption for the remainder of the flight.  That is the end of that checklist.  We had coordinated to level off with ATC and contacted Dispatch on the radio.  After consulting with Dispatch we decided a return to ZZZ was the best option.  We lowered the gear to ensure a safe condition for landing using normal extension.  The gear extended normally.  We evaluated whether to land overweight.  Since there was no urgency at that time with a safe gear indication; we decided to burn down gas to below the max landing weight.  We flew in a holding pattern for approximately 45 minutes and then got vectors for an uneventful landing at ZZZ.  As a precaution; crash fire and rescue followed us to gate without incident.",,"B737 flight crew reported the landing gear failed to fully retract during departure.

I immediately disengaged the auto throttle and retarded the number 2 throttle to keep EGT from rising higher.  The throttle was near idle at this point with acceptable EGT; so I tried advancing the throttle.  Upon throttle advancement; the engine shuttered and vibrated. I immediately pulled the throttle to idle which erased the shuttering and vibration.

After the inspection; we were cleared to taxi to the gate.",,"Preceding the incident; both engines had been running normally with no indications of an impending failure. The Captain was the flying pilot and I; the FO; was the pilot monitoring.  We also had a jumpseater qualified in the 737.  The autopilot and autothrottles were ON; LNAV/VNAV engaged.  The flight had been subject to a near constant light chop for about an hour with a period of occasional moderate turbulence that ultimately caused us to descent from FL340 to FL280 where we encountered smooth air for what may have been 20 minutes.  We had also just begun to enter a line of weather with reported tops around FL250 but we were in smooth air; IFR conditions; with radar showing light echoes on our path.  I can't remember the time although I know it was below -40F. I do remember seeing minimal and normal icing on the windshield wiper for the conditions being experienced.  The ENG Anti-Ice had been on for the descent to FL280 but it was turned off once level due to the temperature being below -40F.At the moment of the incident; I felt Aircraft X mildly yaw and immediately observed; announced the #2 N1 rollback to an RPM that may have been 50-60%.  The CA clicked off the autothrottles and reduced the #2 throttle.  The EGT was observed to be increasing despite the throttle being reduced.  The APU was started; and we turned on ignitors with ENG-Anti Ice. No compressor stall was felt however; the engine was behaving as if it that had been the issue; so we determined that to be the correct procedure.  The CA continued to fly as I read the checklist; and we performed the remaining procedural steps. After a brief discussion about our situation and options; we quickly [requested priority handling] with ATC with XXX SOB (Souls on Board) and 110 minutes of fuel remaining.  ATC gave us a few divert options to consider; and we ultimately settled on ZZZ due to the favorable conditions; support available; and relative location in consideration of our altitude.  Due to the loss of power and performance; we asked for a lower altitude to allow for a drift-down in order to keep our speed as we maneuvered through the weather.  I sent an ACARS message to dispatch about our situation and intentions. The CA briefed the FA's.Once procedures and plans had begun to settle into place; the CA made attempts to increase the throttle from idle to explore remaining power available.  When N1 was increased by about 10% we could feel some vibration and a very subtle popping from the motor; indicative of a possible compressor stall.  I also remember that with the N1 around 45%; the EGT steadily increased to peak at about 760C but the temperature eventually came down to a more normal range after 5 or more minutes at idle.  During the descent; the small amount of power available deteriorated to idle as the only option for smooth operation.  Additionally; the jumpseater noticed that the oil temperature had been slowly and steadily climbing; ultimately peaking at 115 degrees before finally starting to come down after 5-10 minutes.  Although the engine wasn't behaving as expected for a compressor stall event; we suspected this was at least partly the case agitated by the possibility of a mechanical issue.  We elected to keep the engine running under the circumstances but also prepared for a complete failure by opting to perform the one engine inoperative flaps 15 landing procedure.  [Priority handling] equipment was requested and later verified to be in place.  The jumpseater got the ATIS; prepared the Captain's iPad for the approach; and provided a useful crosscheck of our situation.  On final about 3;000 AGL; a right engine OIL FILTER BYPASS indication occurred with no other associated indications; so no actions were performed on short final.  The landing was uneventful.On the ground; we cleared the runway and shutdown the #2 engine.  CFR (crash fire rescue) was quickly on scene and determined the #2 engine to have experienced a post-shutdown fire; reportedly dueto pooled fuel in the tailpipe.  I opened the window to communicate directly with CFR and we were asked to shut down the left engine as well.  CFR extinguished the fire and notified us there was no appearance of any further danger as they continued to monitor the engine.  ZZZ Company coordinated maintenance to come open the #2 cowling for further CFR inspection.  Maintenance determined that we could restart the #1 engine and safely taxi.During the approximately 1 hour on the ground; one passenger was reported; by the FA's; to be causing a security risk with a variety of vulgar comments that included a witness later reporting that he yelled into his phone to customer service; "I'm going to break your f…..g neck."  I coordinated ZZZ police meeting us at the gate and the customer was not allowed to continue to ZZZ with the remaining passengers.  That situation was resolved without further confrontation.This incident; although undesired; was an incredible success by so many involved.  FA's performed amazing calming passengers while performing duties; ATC vectored us around weather and coordinated a significant portion of our divert; our jumpseater was proof of how beneficial another trained person is in that situation; CFR response was robustly professional and reassuring; Dispatch clearly had begun solving many divert related issues before our arrival making the experience much better than expected for everyone; ZZZ ops was amazing to adapt to all of our needs; the ZZZ police were immediately responsive to defuse and resolve our security situation; the Company maintenance team that just happened to be on-site adapted and responded to our need immediately as well as being the solution well after the parking brake was set at the gate.  I'm sure many more people need to be credited from our training department to the hotel desk and I hope Company can take the time to share our appreciation as the supported flight crew.  THANK YOU!",,"Air carrier flight crew reported during cruise the number 2 engine vibrated with an increase in EGT.

Discussed this with dispatch to see if they had another aircraft. None available. Ran land app and it showed if less than braking action 5; we could not land in ZZZ.  Told them if braking action was less than good in ZZZ; I would go to my alternate. Level FL 370- Eng 2 hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. Followed QRH & shut off eng driven 2 B pump.  Within a short time; we got an ELEC 1 Low B pressure light and Flt Cntrl B Low Pressure light with ZERO B qty. Completed QRH for loss of B system. We were in an area with very large weather system that gave us NO " nearest suitable" divert runways (all less than cat 1 with gusty winds). Called dispatch and discussed divert/ runway options. We both agreed going to ZZZ1 was best weather option/ divert option. Subsequently got Eng 1 low pressure light (A side).  I knew the PTU kicks in with B fluid doing the work but did not expect ENG 1 A low pressure light. Had good  A side % and pressure; so chose not to shut off that pump (as one might do as QRH checklist has for low pressure light) and risk total A & B hydraulic failure. After 10 mins; Eng 1 low pressure light went out and qty slowly decreased to 80% with good pressure.Landed ZZZ1 using stby hyd to lower flaps/ slats. ARFF checked for leaks and followed us back to gate after giving all safe.Jet had numerous previous reverser write-ups  that could have been hydraulic b problems in hindsight.Recommendations: There needs to be a NOTE in the LOSS OF SYSTEM  B  procedure in the QRH that says if you loose complete B HYDRAULICS; the A side uses its fluid to balance out the system and you will get an A side low pressure light that comes on for 5-10 mins. Otherwise in similar situation; crews will shut off perfectly good pump on A side.",,"Started with low pressure light on engine driven pump on B side.  Per checklist; turned the pump off.  Later; electric driven pump low pressure light also illuminated on the B side and quantity indicated 0%.  Went to checklist for loss of system B which required; among other things; a flaps 15 landing.  We were unable to land ZZZ due to required landing distance and opted for ZZZ1. Some time later; engine driven pump A low pressure light illuminated.   CA [advised ATC]; requested clearance direct ZZZ1; worked with dispatch and informed FA and passengers while I flew the aircraft.  When he was ready; he took the aircraft back to fly.  Landing was uneventful.  We taxied off the runway and ARFF met us.  They informed us that we had a mild to moderate puddle forming at our right engine.  They followed us to the gate.  We taxied in under our own power.Cause: Mechanical issue; no causal factors.Suggestions: While it would not prevent this from occurring; it would be less stressful for the crew if there was a note on the checklist that stated it is normal for the A system low pressure light to illuminate.",,"B737-800 flight crew reported a low hydraulic pressure indication during cruise.

I elected to reject the takeoff. Reject was initiated at about 80 KIAS. Below 85 KIAS as the rejected takeoff (RTO) did NOT engage. Tower was advised of the reject. The First Officer (FO) made a PA to "remain seated". We exited the runway I checked the doors page and the gear page and accomplished the related checklists and elected to return to the gate. Upon inspection Maintenance discovered that a large ADP bleed line (~5" in diameter) had ruptured in the wheel well with a section approximately 14" long mostly gone. Further investigation revealed that the rupture had sent shrapnel all over within the wheel well and the aircraft was removed from service to survey any secondary damage that may have occurred from the shrapnel. Passengers seated in the area reported hearing the bang. We heard nothing in the cockpit. During our debriefing we reviewed the low speed abort criteria and noted that a bleed loss body was not on the list specifically; but more generally under "system failure." Given the Mechanics description of the shrapnel we were left wondering what secondary failures might have been caused by the shrapnel; if any; had we taken the flight airborne. We were not sure what wires and lines run through the area. We did check the air synoptic and noted that the system had performed the automatic isolation as would be expected; thus after the rupture; bleed air was likely not being injected into the area. Perhaps the risk of secondary damage has been assessed; but not being aware of that; at this point I think that perhaps it should be considered to add bleed loss body to the low speed abort item list. As an aside; For XX+ years of my piloting career I have been trained to call out "abort." Being aware of that; since we changed to "reject;" I have briefed that "in the heat of the moment; I am not sure if I will call out reject or abort." It was a valuable briefing; as I called out "Abort." It was hard to unlearn decades of training. I knew as soon as I said it that it was the wrong call out; but my FO know what my decision was and performed perfectly. Also; knowing that the Reject checklist primarily focuses on engine failure/fire; after clearing the runway I called for the bleed loss checklist that was displayed as I was concerned about having hot bleed air ducting into areas it should not and the potential for a fire or related damage. Though we accomplished all of the items on the reject checklist; we realized during our debrief that we had failed to actually run the reject checklist. All of our training for rejects is either to not reject; or for an engine failure/fire. This did not fit into those 2 training events; and yet there were other considerations; hot bleed air leak; secondary damage. As we focused on assessing the potential impact of hot bleed air we forgot to actually run the reject checklist. As this was a low speed reject; without RTO (not as violent as we train in the sim) and an anomaly I have never had; either in the sim or on the line; we were out of the normal sequence where we have been trained to run the reject checklist. When we debriefed this; we reviewed the reject checklist and had in fact accomplished everything on it. I would suggest that training incorporate something like this event for reject training.I had never considered the potential for an explosive bleed line rupture that could cause secondary damage. Though the Maintenance Team did not know the extent of any secondary damage resulting from the shrapnel the potential further reinforced the correctness of my decision to reject the takeoff.",,,,"B777 flight crew received a 'Bleed Loss Body' EICAS message on take-off roll.

As we were about 90NM west of ZZZ2 and about 2:40 into the flight we received an ECAM "ANTI ICE STBY PITOT FAULT". At the time I was the PF (Pilot flying) and following SOP the CA (Captain) remained the PM to resolve the ECAM. With ECAM complete and screens normal the flight continued normally; and I needed a bio break; so I went to the LAV. As I was about to reenter the flight deck; I could hear several chimes. Once I was back in my seat the CA informed me of the situation and I let the Purser know she could go back in the cabin. The CA was hand flying the plane as we lost all automation. He elected to remain PF and I stayed the PM. Using proper CRM and SOP I followed the ECAM prompt. The CA also had a deadheading CA join us in the flight deck who helped us trying to find more information in the QRH as well as augment our resources and CRM capabilities to handle the non-normal situation.Once the ECAM were complete and screens were normal I went to find the "L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT" non-normal in the FM (Flight Manual) and the condition paragraph confirmed loss of AP (Autopilot); A/THR and FAC consistent with the complete loss of automation. After the CA [requested priority handling] and as directed; I followed our SOP descent procedure to set up for ILS XXL in ZZZ2 since we wanted to use the longest runway available. By the time we turned around to ZZZ2 we were about 120 NM West and established on vectors and descent for the approach and upon the CA's request I also made a brief announcement to the passenger that following degraded instrumentation and navigation capabilities we were diverting to ZZZ2 for precaution and safety; and we would be on the ground in about 20 minutes. Once the descent procedure was complete and I did the arrival briefing for the CA; we were vectored for the approach and the CA flew in IMC from FL200 to 2;300 ft AGL with raw data only. As we went VMC about 3NM prior to ZZZZZ on ILS XXL we called the runway in sight and approach control cleared us for the visual XXL. The CA met all our stabilized approach criteria the descent; approach and landing were accomplished uneventfully and safely. Once we parked at the gate; we were met by the maintenance crew; and we individually and collectively gave them a narration of the incident. Then the ZZZ Assistant Chief met us and once the CA and I were able to debrief we received a fitness for duty assessment questionnaire to determine we were no longer fit for duty. The CA and I had a complete and extensive debrief afterwards and the CA was extremely thorough to explain that the IOE and Line Check couldn't be completed which I already knew since the CA briefed situations that would require to discontinue the Line Check. The CA made further arrangements so I can be quickly rescheduled to complete IOE.",,"While operating Flight XXXX ZZZ-ZZZ1; and conducting a Line Check for new hire and IOE pilot; we received two ECAM faults while at cruise flight at FL370. The first fault occurred approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes into the flight. The first fault was an ANTI ICE STBY PITOT FAULT. I had First Officer continue to fly the aircraft while I ran the ECAM and referenced the QRH procedure. This particular fault had NO to do items associated with it and advised us that the standby pitot heat had failed. Once the ECAM was complete and screens normal we continued normal flight as all other systems were operational and the aircraft was capable of normal flight in RVSM airspace. We decided as a crew to set up a lavatory break and started that process per SOP. While FO (First Officer) was out of the cockpit and in the lav; we then received a L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT at FL370. I announced ECAM and 2 seconds later the Autopilot; Flight directors; and Autothrust all disconnected simultaneously. There were many audible alarms and chimes going off when the Purser who was upfront with me per the SOP said "What's going on?" to which I responded we just lost everything instrumentation wise. I immediately took over manual control of the aircraft and began flying the aircraft on raw data instrumentation. FO then returned to the cockpit and I advised him of the non normal status of the aircraft. I elected to continue flying the aircraft and had FO become the PM and state to run the ECAM non normal procedures. I realized we had no autopilots; and lost LNAV navigation; and told FO we needed to advise ATC. The Purser advised me before she left the cockpit that we had A crew DH (Dead Head) in the back and I advised her to have the Captain of that crew come up to the cockpit to help us with the non normal situation. CA (Captain) then came up and sat on the jumpseat to help us with the non normal situation. Even though he was a different aircraft type pilot; using CRM principles and training; I elected to give Captain A my QRH to see if he could also help us diagnose and maybe get some instrumentation back on the PFD (Primary Flight Display) and MFD (Multi-function Flight Display). I then [requested priority handling] and advised ATC when had lost all automation and were flying raw data. At this point we were about 90miles just west of ZZZ2 and I elected to divert there due to it having long sufficient runways and a major hub for Company. I had FO then get ATIS; landing data and advise dispatch and maintenance via ACARS of our status and intentions on diverting to ZZZ2. ATC then gave us radar vectors direct to ZZZ2 and set us up to land via the ILS XXL in ZZZ2. In the descent I called the Purser and gave her the official briefing per SOP. Per the QRH procedure and notes; I advised her based upon the aircraft status that an evacuation would not be probable. The whole descent and final approach into ZZZ2 was in IMC and flown via raw data. We joined the ILS XXL approach and broke out of IMC at approximately 2300 ft AGL. We were then cleared for the visual to XXL and landed safely and uneventfully. We taxiied to the gate did the parking checklist and did a quick debrief of the situation. We were met by maintenance personnel and advised them of the faults we received and loss of all automation. I then verbally debriefed the flight with the Chief Pilot; and also verbally debriefed with ZZZ2 Assistant Chief Pilot xxxx. xxxx then ran myself and FO through human factors checklist to determine our risk level for continuing our trip. It was then agreed upon by all parties that we were not fit for duty to continue due to the stress incurred during the incident. Afterwards myself and FO had a thorough debrief of the situation. I advised him that unfortunately we could not complete his IOE and Line Check due to having to [request priority handling]. I advised him I would reach out to the fleet training managers and advise them of the situation so they could put together a plan to get FO finished up with IOE.",,"A319 flight crew reported loss of auto flight systems in cruise.

ATC instructed us to turn off taxiway 3 instead; and with traffic on short final; I applied power to expedite. Approaching Taxiway 3; braking was again modulated as braking action was good/fair. I made the turn at approximately 9-10 kts but had to slow further as the nose wheel was losing traction. As we rolled on facing towards another aircraft holding short of Runway XYL at Taxiway 3; I applied braking and nothing happened. I increased brake pressure to no avail. It was apparent at this time that we were sliding. My First Officer (FO) also stood on the brakes and at this time I applied reverse thrust and turned the tiller to the left to attempt to arrest the sliding. It appeared and impact was imminent. My FO acted quickly and advised the preceding aircraft to move which caused tower to tell them to expedite and the fast actions of that Captain; as well as my FO and myself prevented a collision.  The braking action on all taxiways north of taxiway 1 were poor/NIL. There were small burns of snow and patches of ice on all ramps and taxiways.

As I contacted Departure; they gave us a right turn direct to our next fix. Captain said that the plane wasn't flying right and said we are leveling off at 5000 ft. and remaining on current heading. He then told me to [request priority handling with ATC] and a return to field. He told me that the controls were snapping fully to the right and it was very hard to return the aileron position back to neutral. He then stated that banking the controls to the left was normal but banking it back to the right would snap the ailerons fully to the right again. We told Departure that we could only make left-hand turns and requested to return to the field for Runway XXC.We then continued to shallowly bank the plane to the left to avoid large control inputs that would cause snapping of the ailerons. Captain mentioned that he was holding the controls with extreme force. As he was flying; I set the plane up for the ILS XXC. I proceeded to look for a flight control QRH regarding the ailerons. I then gave the FAs (Flight Attendant) a call to let them know the situation and that we are landing in about 10 minutes. I then made a PA to the passengers that we had an indication that we needed to return to the airport. We lined up with [Runway] XXC and the Captain noticed as I extended flaps; he felt binding and snapping of the controls. We had an overweight landing with a smooth touchdown about 200 FPM.

CA PF (Captain Pilot Flying); less than 300 hours in type. FO PM (First Officer Pilot Monitoring); less than 100 hours at this carrier. XXX souls on board. ZZZ RWY XXR. Flaps 5 takeoff. 26K thrust. Assumed temp 39C. 150;900 lbs. ZZZZZ SID. Night. Thin cloud layer at 5000 feet. Unrestricted visibility. This was a severe flight control malfunction. What follows is my best recollection of the event.     ZZZ Tower cleared us for takeoff on RWY XXR. During initial climb; at 500 feet AGL; I began a hand flown right hand turn in accordance with the ZZZZZ Departure. As I deflected the yoke to the right; it snapped forcefully right; and I experienced an extreme; uncommanded roll rate. I was struggling with both hands to stop the yoke from banking us beyond 30 degrees. The yoke was still commanding a greater roll rate. Startle factor was tremendous. I could not verbalize any words to the FO (PM). There were no master cautions; no master warnings; and no annunciator lights. Then suddenly the yoke became very light. As I moved the yoke back toward center; the extreme uncommanded roll rate kicked in to the left. I was experiencing severe longitudinal instability; and I was completely task saturated. With the instability; it was a struggle just to hold the wings level. I started making rapid commands to the FO: "Bug Up Bug!" "Bug 200!" "Bug our speed!" ZZZ Departure then told us something about turning right to a fix; and contacting center. I told the FO: "No; advise ATC; flight control malfunction; present heading; 5000 feet."While climbing on the 025 heading; I continued to give left and right yoke inputs to help with troubleshooting. Somewhere between 3000 ft and 5000 ft MSL I determined I could deflect the yoke left to make a left turn and the aircraft felt normal. However; when I moved the yoke back toward center; or if I had any yoke inputs right of center; it felt like my right aileron was going straight to the full up position. Wings level felt like I was trying to balance the roll axis on a needle point. Continual yoke inputs were required to keep the wings level. What was wrong? Aileron Jam? No; there isn't any binding. Hydraulics? No; I would have an annunciator light. Bad PCU? No; the good PCU would overpower the faulty one. Feel and centering mechanism? No; left turns feel normal. I wanted the aircraft on the ground ASAP because I didn't know how much longer we could maintain positive aircraft control; any further deterioration would likely be catastrophic. While on the 025 heading and 5000 feet; ZZZ assigned a right hand turn to some heading and I told the FO "No; we can only make wide left turns." He informed ZZZ accordingly. ZZZ assigned us a left turn to heading of 270. I spun the bank angle selector to 10 degrees and began a shallow banked left hand turn. As I rollout; on heading 270; the yoke tries to overpower me again; but I anticipate it; and manage to level the wings. Nothing is improving; but it also isn't getting worse. I'm adapting; anticipating; learning how to manage this longitudinal instability and the uncommanded roll rates. On crosswind; the FO asked me if I would like him to brief the flight attendants. This question helped bring me solidly back into focus. "Yes; tell the FAs we are returning to ZZZ; Precautionary Landing; 10 mins." Why precautionary? I still had normal control of my vertical axis and lateral axis. Winds 350. Little aileron needed; if any; so I can keep firm pressure on the yoke; maintain positive control; and complete a safe landing. Then the FO asked me if I wanted him to talk to the passengers. "Yes; tell them shortly after takeoff we had a small indication up front so we are returning to ZZZ to let our maintenance team look at the aircraft. We'll provide more information on the ground." ZZZ then gave us a turn to heading 180. I share with the FO what I'm experiencing; and that I may need his help to give me more left aileron input. I asked him to notify dispatchand to include "aileron malfunction" in the text. Next; I ask the FO to look through the QRH for anything flight control and aileron related. We couldn't find anything that fit our situation. Then I have the FO complete the After Takeoff Checklist; but keep the Flaps at 5; followed by the Descent Checklist. The FO asks if I wanted him to set up and brief the approach. "Yes." Then I told him we will do Flaps 30; Autobrake 3; and to run the Before Landing Checklist. ZZZ is trying to give us a base turn. I want more distance so I have room to make a 10 degree banked turn; and to gently correct an overshoot. The FO relays to ZZZ that we want a 20 mile final. I overshoot base to final a little so we are on approximately a 340 heading to join. ZZZ asks if we can turn right at all? "No." Controller says that is okay; that he will just give us a big left hand turn so we can rejoin. I tell the FO; "No; tell him we are joining from here. We will make it work." Why? It is going to take me 6-9 minutes to make a huge left turn and I don't know how much time we have before our problem gets worse. The priority is still to get on the ground ASAP. I hit the DATA button; see 4000 ft by the fix were pointing toward; and start making commands. "Bug 180…Flaps 10…Set 4000 feet…vertical speed down 1000 fpm…arm Approach Mode." When he selected Flaps 10; the yoke started pulling left and right while the flaps were in transit; but I'm able to overpower the yoke and keep our wings level. What is going on? Flaps and ailerons are independent systems. This should not be happening. "Set 3000 feet; vertical speed down 1000 fpm…Gear down; Flaps 15" and with the Flaps 15 selection here goes the yoke oscillating left and right again. "Flaps 25…Flaps 30…Below the Line." The yoke was pulling with each flap selection. I visually verify Gear Down and Green; Flaps 30; Speed Brake Armed. We are on the Glide Slope. There will not be a go around. Something inside told me I wanted a less aggressive brake application; so around 1000 feet I tell the FO to select Autobrakes 2. With continual lateral inputs I'm able to keep the aircraft balanced on the roll axis. At approximately 20 feet Tail Strike; Tail Strike; Tail Strike is flashing on my HUD. I relax a little back pressure. Smooth touch down. Fly the nose wheel down. CA "Manual Braking." FO "Autobrakes Off."  We are tracking centerline and there is a sudden jerk/pull to the right. Very odd. Like a sudden rudder kick; a grabby brake; or a right hand gust but winds are 350. I'm able to correct with brake and rudder. We slow to a near stop and clear at [taxiway] 1. Airport rescue and fire fighting asks if we require any assistance. "Tell him negative and thank you." ZZZ asks if we [are able to continue to gate]. "Yes." Ramp clears us straight in to the gate. ZZZ Ramp authorizes us to park with DGS (Docking Guidance System) only. I set the brake and we complete our shutdown flow. I tell the FO to keep the door closed. I need a minute to get myself composed. The severity of what we experienced is kicking in. I make a quick PA; "Ladies and Gentlemen; I spoke to our maintenance team and they want to take this aircraft to the hanger for troubleshooting; so please gather all of your belongings; exit the aircraft; go to the top of the jetway; and we will have further instructions. Thank you again for your patience." I had not really spoken to maintenance; but I knew the aircraft was done; and the FO and I were done. While the passengers were deplaning; I was able to finish my duties. I asked the FO to see if we had a tail strike. We did not. I called my dispatcher and he asked me if I landed overweight. This is when I was first aware that yes we landed overweight. I spoke to the Duty pilot; two local maintenance teams; and received a call from my Chief Pilot. The logbook entries took some time for me to complete; because I was trying to describe the malfunction with accurate wording; and because the aircraft maintenancelog discrepancy blocks are character limited. With 8 discrepancy entries complete; we turned the aircraft over to maintenance and went home.Reflection 1) Both pilots were needed to meet the demands of the situation. This is exactly why we must keep two pilots at the controls. I was incredibly saturated with maintaining aircraft control; and intensely thinking through the malfunction and appropriate tasks. When I gave commands to the FO; I had to trust that he was completing them exactly as I asked. I was only able to divert my attention for very brief moments to verify the big items: ILS Identifier; Gear Down and Green; Flaps 30; Speed Brakes Armed. Everything else was a bonus. The FO did a magnificent job of executing PM duties. Further; he led me with appropriate questions that helped pull me from being overwhelmed to managing the situation; and he perfectly executed PAs that are normally performed by the CA.Reflection 2) It may have been the right hand flight spoilers that were deflecting to full stop; and not an aileron problem. This would help explain why left turns were fine; but right turns were not. I don't know for certain because this fleet does not have synoptic pages.Reflection 3) After we were safely on the gate; I located two; less severe RH Aileron write ups approximately two weeks prior to this flight. If I had seen this information prior to the flight; I would have briefed it as a threat and experienced less startle factor when we experienced the severe uncommanded roll issue. Further; those write ups may also have been a flight spoiler issues but again; we pilots don't know for certain without supporting evidence from a flight control synoptic page.Cause: TBD. Unknown mechanical malfunction resulted in aircraft longitudinal instability and extreme uncommanded roll rates. Suggestions: This fleet must be equipped with system synoptic pages. Synoptic pages provide critical information to pilots during an emergency. If we had a flight control synoptic page; we would have observed exactly what was happening with our spoilers and ailerons; and responded appropriately. As it was; we were in the blind and having to guess as to what was happening with the primary and secondary flight controls. Further; the flight synoptic page would have allowed us to create more precise write ups; thus focusing the efforts of our maintenance team; and returning the aircraft to service sooner. Additionally; my three day lookback in the aircraft maintenance log didn't reveal previous RH Aileron issues. From now on; I will do a two week review of the log.",,,,"B737-800 Captain reported severe flight control malfunction during initial climb that required substantial manual control to maintain wings level.

Cabin crew detected the same issues of pressure change in the cabin but the effects felt physiologically worse. The ear pressure and chest tightness became more and more noticeable as I continued with my duties and took a toll on my mind clarity. Upon descent; the cabin was preparing for a cautionary landing once again as we diverted to ZZZ. My safety compliance did not include picking up the plastic service items in my first class as my priority became to sit down in my jump seat after walking through the cabin and checking on customers using oxygen as my chest became tighter and tighter. The crew was finishing speaking to the Physician in command that had been contacted for passengers that were using oxygen for complaints of chest tightness. I walked through  assured the cabin if anybody had any medical concerns to please contact us by alerting us with the flight attendant call button. I as FA1  repeated our prepare for landing  instructions over the PA and made them aware we would be landing soon. My compliance checks were modified as I remained in my seat and my crew made their way thru the cabin. I instructed them to prepare for a cautionary landing and that sitting in our jumpseats was priority as we made our way into our descent.Upon landing the aircraft took longer to depressurize as we touched down and made our way down the runway. The entire aircraft shaked roughly for approximately 20 seconds on the way to a stop. I detected the difference in landing and called the aft galley to tell them something felt off with the landing and depressurization and to be careful of the doors in case we were still pressurized. After the call I felt extremely nauseous and head felt tight and achy. As I started to feel dizzy starting at the forward closet I felt vomit rising and made my way to the forward lav and left my jumpseat to relief myself. My FA3 remained in their jumpseat. I was able to come back to my jumpseat approximately 5 min after and remained unbuckled in case I needed to return to the restroom. I was able to disarm my door but my FA3 completed PA's for me and the crew disarming. During deplaning I was unable to remain at the door entry as I returned to the restroom to vomit. I was assisted by paramedics that met the flight and followed up care by ambulance and emergency room visit after the aircraft deplaned.Suggestions: Not use an aircraft that was and continued to malfunction.

It was about this time that we got a call from the FAs (Flight Attendant) that there was a noticeable flame that was seen out the back of the #1 Engine. I disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and recoordinated the aircraft. We decided that the most appropriate action at this point was to shut the engine down and secure it.

RVR. After a thorough brief and setup; we decided to land flaps 40 for a little more visibility. During flaps extension on final approach; the pilot monitoring selected flaps to 30°; then 40°; and ran the Landing Checklist. At that time the pilot monitoring saw the trailing edge flaps were stuck at 15° and verbalized the configuration. The pilot flying spun the speed bug back up so we didn't get too slow and said during the debrief he noticed the PFD's (Primary Flight Display) speed tape looked different that normal; but hadn't realized why until the pilot monitoring called out the failure. A missed approach was executed and [priority handling was requested]. Once the missed was completed and the aircraft stable; the pilot flying continued flying and took radio duties; while the pilot monitoring ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree. That concluded that the flap handle did nothing to alter the flap position.Because of the weather in ZZZZ; the crew discussed going to the listed alternate airport of ZZZ. However; with the current fuel on board and the flaps stuck extended; decided that would not be prudent as we would land in a very low fuel state. While conducting the QRH; the procedure set us up for a flaps 15 landing. With the weather still at 1;200 ft. RVR in ZZZZ and an autoland required; we elected to use the alternate flap extension system to attempt to get the flaps to 30 as we didn't know how the aircraft would react to a flaps 15 autoland; or even if it would do an autoland at all. We deviated from the QRH to make this happen as it seems the procedure never planned on a requirement of a CAT III autoland after a flap malfunction. The flight attendants were briefed with the brief items; and a passenger announcement was made. Once realigned with final; the flap handle was moved to the 30 detent; the alternate extension was used; and the flaps and slats extended. The pilot monitoring changed the landing speeds to flaps 30 speeds and an uneventful autoland was accomplished on Runway XXL. ZZZZ ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was standing by to do an inspection which concluded with no issues and the aircraft taxied to the gate under its own power.

Just on this flight today my crew named 4 other flight attendants they knew that this same incident had happened to. In their stories mostly the #2 being injured as they are on the cart by themself back there. I would be curious if you pull injury reports pertaining to 777 and/or 787 galley floors what would be found. As well as maintenance write ups and flight attendant reports. As the #2 I mostly set up the galley; so procedure is Flight Attendant (FA) 3 and 6 and 7 and 8 have carts in each aisle together. The 2 (me) is on a cart alone; going partially up aircraft right aisle from back; back to the galley; then partway up aircraft left aisle; a 'horse shoe' to help. When I pulled back from aircraft right to go up aircraft left aisle; I backed into the galley with the cart and tried to avoid this bulge; but the cart wheel caught it at an angle (not wheel straight back) causing the top heavy beverage cart full of sodas etc; to tip over and crash to the ground. I tried to catch it but it was way too heavy. It came down on my toe. I'm now out waiting for my appointment for an x-ray to see if my toe/foot is broken.If the company would properly maintain their aircraft and not create a hazardous working environment for crew in neglecting to do so. This could also jeopardize passenger safety as they pass through the galley; or heaven forbid if someone tripped in an evacuation. I don't think procedure is wrong; I feel it's safe to be on the cart by yourself if you have a level surface to work on. Just if someone else was on the other side in this instance MAYBE they could have helped catch it; but they're incredibly heavy so very likely not.

However; after about a minute we observed the oil pressure in the number 1 engine begin to fall. The indication then transitioned into the Amber and Red bands. Both the CA (Captain) and I agreed that it was not an abnormal indication; and it was in fact an actual issue. We elected to shutdown the number 1 engine by pulling the thrust lever to idle IAW (In accordance with) the "Engine Shut Down" checklist. During this time flight controls were transferred to the CA; who became the PF; and I assumed PM (Pilot Monitoring). The total time the indication of oil quantity 0 and Oil pressure falling; was only a minute or two until the engine shut down procedure was completed. At this point; I initially began to run the "Engine Fire; Severe Damage; or Separation Checklist" which the CA corrected me on and we determined that we needed to run the "Engine Shut Down - NG" checklist. We [requested priority handling]; and advised ATC of the number 1 Engine issue and shut down. We communicated souls and fuel on board and advised ATC that we required a little more time to troubleshoot and setup and that ZZZ would be our diversion airport. The above mentioned checklist was completed which then directed us to the "One Engine Inoperative Landing" checklist. We worked through all the steps at the appropriate times; "Deferred Items"; and "Before Landing". We then advised ATC we would like runway XXR given it's length and our overweight nature and single engine configuration. Given our distance to ZZZ (~50nm); it was determined this was also the best option for safety and operational reasons. We loaded the RNAV [runway] XXR into the FMC and began our approach with initial vectors from ATC to the final approach course for runway XXR. While on final for XXR we completed the "Landing Checklist" via the QRH and landed uneventfully.After landing; we made the determination we could safely clear runway XXR and perform our assessments on taxiway 1. There; we completed our after landing flows and coordinated with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to have them inspect the number 1 engine. During their assessment they were able to determine that there was fluid leaking from the number one engine. This fluid we assumed as being engine oil. We then coordinated with operations and ATC and chose to taxi to gate 1. We asked that ARFF follow us to the gate as a precaution. Upon parking we completed our flows and the Parking Checklist and deplaned the passengers without incident.During our debrief; the CA and I found three areas in which we could have improved upon. One; was the original "Engine Fire; Severe Damage and Separation" checklist that I selected. As a team we determined as soon as we got to the fire handle step that we were in the incorrect checklist and then proceeded to the proper one.Second; was that we did not "verbalize" the Drift Down checklist per the QRC. We attributed this to experience and the fact that we were near ZZZ and starting a descent already using LVL Change as we had referenced the VNAV engine out page which stated ~22;400ft. We had already requested a descent to FL220 so we agreed we were on the way to a safe altitude and airspeed. We also started the APU given the fact that the number 1 engine GEN was offline. After discussing it; we could have done better by using that checklist. After review of the Drift down checklist; we determined that we covered all items in that checklist already via the "Engine Shut Down" checklist.Third; we did not verbalize the "Engine Limit/ Surge" memory items. The memory items were accomplished using the "Engine Shut Down" checklist vs the "Engine Limit" checklist.",,"Air carrier pilots reported the loss of oil quantity and pressure during cruise flight. The pilots stated they shut the engine down and diverted.",

XA:00 am local time.We were told by ZZZ approach to maintain 210 knots initially and we were configured at Flaps 5 with gear up. As we got closer; ZZZ instructed us to slow to 180 knots until the FAF (ZZZZZ). As we slowed down inside of the FAF and began configuring; we noticed that the flaps were not going below Flaps 5. We began to speed up to correct maneuvering speed of approximately 190~200 knots before aborting the approach and imitating a go-around. We requested a box pattern over the coast away from the terrain and Captain flew us out until reaching the initial target of 3;000 ft.  The autopilot was engaged on after that point. I began to dive into the QRH and settled on Trailing Edge Flap Disagree because of the disagreement between the flap handle position and the actual flap position without any split in the needle.  I asked Captain to verify that we are on the correct checklist and he did.  After that conversation; Captain took over the QRH checklist while I handled the plane and the radio. Captain completed the QRH procedure and verified each step with me. We talked about figuring our own landing distance calculations and steps before continuing. We completed all the way up to opening the guarded switch and pulling the alternate flaps switch as the checklists calls for. We briefed each other and came to a conclusion that due to fuel and drag penalties of putting gear and flaps down; as the checklists calls for; we were going to finish the communication part before continuing and heading in towards ZZZ. I believe we were approximately 9K-10K pounds of fuel when we went around initially in ZZZ.We [requested priority handling] and told ATC we will be ready to head back into ZZZ in about 5-10 minutes. Captain briefed the Flight Attendants and completed the brief; then Captain made a professional PA to the passenger of what was going on. While that was happening; I ACARSd the dispatcher a simple message of what was going on and what our plan was. After that we both came back in together and continued the checklist and began to utilize the alternate flap switch to lower the flaps and complete the [priority handling] checklist. The checklists successfully allowed us to lower the flaps to 15 and make an approach.We then headed back into ZZZ's ILS XXR and landed uneventfully.The ARFF truck followed us to the gate while checking our brake temperature.Everything was normal and we parked at the gate with the flaps down and maintenance was subsequently notified.",,"While configuring to land at ZZZ; flaps stuck at 5 degrees.  We noticed flaps were not extending to landing flaps (30 degrees) shortly after passing FAF for runway ILS XXR.   As soon as I realized flap lever was set at 30 degrees and flap indicator showed 5 degrees; I called go around; excuted go around procedures. I told FO to tell tower we were going around and tower told us to fly runway heading; climb and maintain 3000 feet. Tower passed us over to approach and I leveled at 3000 feet; then turned on auto throttles and auto pilot. Initially I had FO get into checklist but he was having a hard time finding appropriate checklist. So; I transferred aircraft control to FO and asked he keep radios. So; I got into checklist and started working through   Flaps - Trailing Edge Flap Disagree.  When we got to step three of the checklist and when "Flaps do not move as commanded" I decided to [request priority handling]. We continued through checklist and it led us to extend flaps using alternate method. We attained flaps 15 and landed using flaps 15 speeds. I landed about 1300 feet down runway; on centerline and rolled out to intersection; held short of runway XXL and the fire department showed we did not have hot brakes as we taxied to gate. I debriefed maintenance; dispatcher and Chief Pilot. Chief Pilot did a short wellness assessment and I was a little shaken by the experience so decided to not fly next 2 legs and just to ZZZ2 to finish trip.",,"B737 Air Carrier crew reported a trailing edge flap malfunction while on final approach.

All was still normal as we climbed through 10;000 feet and I checked/announced the pressurization panel ("Cabin Altitude indicated near Sea Level").   We received a clearance to climb to a final cruising altitude from ZZZ [Approach] of FL340 (changed from original FL350);  changed the FMC and pressure controller altitude to reflect 340 - we didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.  We were cleared direct ZZZZZ.   We reached flight level 340 and were there approximately 8 minutes.  ZZZ [Approach] cleared us to switch to enroute frequencies. Soon after; FO (First Officer)  scanned the overhead and acutely recognized / announced that the differential pressure was displaying approx 6.5 which is less than we typically see.   With that awareness; I noticed and pointed out that our cabin altitude pressure was very close to 10;000 and moments later the cabin altitude warning horn began to sound. FO and I immediately proceeded with our immediate action items (O2 on 100%; crew comm. established; seat belt sign on). I pulled out the QRC for the Cabin Altitude Warning and began the checklist. Since we had just left ZZZ freq. and we had not yet left the FIR; I switched back to ZZZ [Approach] and asked for a turn back to ZZZ2 [Airport]. I [requested priority handling] and proceeded with the checklist and descent. The Outflow valve appeared fully closed before confirmed with checklist. PASS OXYGEN switch was selected ON and the masks were dropped in the back. In the course of the descent; I believe the cabin altitude got to 12k but didn't see anything beyond that.   I spoke with the flight attendants and the passengers.   When we reached 10k and were in hold to burn fuel to reach max landing weight; we put controller back to auto and it seemed to control cabin fine at the lower altitude.    We proceeded with vectors to an RNAV approach and uneventful landing to runway XXR at ZZZ2.   During the process; we communicated several times with the flight attendants (they were very calm and professional throughout) and that was reflected by the passengers cooperative and calm nature as well.   FO was equally professional with his focus in continuing to prioritize flying the aircraft first in a very skilled manner.   His recognition of the pressure differential abnormality certainly helped lessen the startle effect that could have made the situation more difficult.     There were no other faults associated with the event (no failure of the pressure controller or pack faults).     The cabin altitude warning horn and the cabin altitude/differential pressure gauge were our only indications of faults with the system.   Initial speed in the hold at ZZZZZ1 was inadvertently 250 kts but corrected in the first turn.  One concern and difficulty was communicating with audio panel that used a rubberband to hold switch in the intercom position.   The rubber band appeared on but was not holding in the select position.",,"Ground ops/preflight for this flight were normal. On climb out CA (Captain) and I both noted cabin pressure was normal climbing through 10000. It was near sea level; I do not remember the exact altitude. Upon reaching cruise altitude; approximately 5-10 minutes after leveling off I happened to look up at the pressurization and noticed differential pressure was at about 6.5 units. I remembered that typically I've seen it around 8 at cruise and I told the captain. We then both noticed cabin altitude was at 10000 ft and mentioned this was very abnormal. We noticed the outflow valve indicator was in the full closed position. About 5-10 seconds later the cabin altitude warning alarmed and I immediately said masks; took off my headset and donned the oxygen mask. I configured my panel and said FO (First Officer) ON O2; captain said CA ON O2. He then immediately called ZZZ [Approach] and asked for immediate vectors off course and a lower altitude. We got 10000 and while this was going on Captain started running the descent QRC followed by QRH; while I was flying the plane. Initially I bugged 10000 and pushed level change; and set speed to 280. We started descending and I focused on flying while he did checklists. After maybe one minute I noticed we had more space for flying faster on the speed tape so we accelerated to final speed of 330 knots eventually. At some point during the checklist CA dropped the passenger oxygen masks in the back; spoke with the flight attendants and advised ATC while I prepared us for landing in ZZZ2 [Airport]. At some point in the mid teen altitudes we noted cabin altitude was back to normal and we removed our oxygen masks and put on our headsets again. We leveled off at 10000 and slowed to 250. We found the manual valve controller to be a little difficult so we tried AUTO mode again and it seemed to work completely normal so we left it like that. I got our clearance to ZZZ2 and headed direct to ZZZZZ for the ZZZZZ arrival. We were below 18000 and I was aware of this; but I chose to work in the FMC due to CA task saturation; while being fully aware of aircraft state/flight path management at all times and making sure that was the #1 priority. I got the weather; landing data; messaged dispatch and configured the FMC for arrival and approach. I noted we would be landing about 5000 lbs overweight so the captain had us request a lower altitude and we received 8000. We then flew with flight spoilers deployed and did a few laps of holding as published at ZZZZZ1 to burn fuel for reach our max landing weight. We did the first turn in holding at 250. We then remembered max holding speeds and slowed to 220ish and extended to Flaps 5 to burn more fuel. Ca and I had a discussion about who would be flying; and I told him I would prefer him to fly due to me having less experience in the aircraft than him. He briefed while I flew; then we swapped controls; finished holding and received vectors for the RNAV (gps) RWY XXR. We then landed without any further notable events and taxied to the gate. The only warning we got during the flight was the cabin altitude warning.",,"B-737 air carrier crew reported a pressurization malfunction at cruise before entering oceanic airspace.

It's associated overhead bin was very hot to the touch by two different F/As; but no smoke was visible. Customers were being relocated to other seats; away from the affected row.I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ center and diverted to ZZZ1.

I began reaching for the crew O2 mask and contemplated running the smoke / fume removal QRH. But it quickly stabilized and began to decrease afterwards. The odor was not causing significant irritation to the eyes; nose or throat. We therefore prioritized getting on the ground as soon as possible.The cabin crew reported that the row XX overhead bin was still hot; but the burning plastic odor had decreased.

We pulled off the runway after informing Tower of the rejected takeoff; sat for several minutes and ran through the appropriate checklist; channels; etc; and elected to attempt a second takeoff. The same issue happened on the second takeoff attempt (under 10 knots); we rejected; advised ATC; and returned to gate and were met by maintenance. The mechanics found faults with the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and ASM which warranted an MEL deferral of the autothrottle system. After a delay we headed back out for takeoff with no autothrottles and were cleared for takeoff once again. Immediately after lift off; we lost all lateral and vertical navigation symbology on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and the Mode Control Panel (MCP). A [request for priority handling] was declared on initial check in with the Departure Controller where we requested and received runway heading and a level off-altitude right away from ATC. I hand flew the airplane using raw data for a few minutes with some navigation sources eventually coming back online; but were unsure if the sources were reliable. The autopilot was eventually reengaged successfully and I monitored the progress while guarding the flight controls and manually manipulating thrust as needed. We then ran through appropriate checklists; protocols; and procedures and had to make an overweight [priority handling] landing and requested for Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to be present. We set up for a long final to XXC at ZZZ with the help of ATC. I performed the landing and rollout which was uneventful. We pulled off the runway to a complete stop and had ARFF inspect the exterior of the aircraft including the gear and brakes before continuing taxiing to the gate. Maintenance met us at the gate once again advised they would be removing the aircraft from service.",,"After losing both lateral and vertical guidance we [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ.

We departed ZZZ at XA:25 on a rescheduled delayed departure flight to ZZZZ. There were four pilots on the augmented flight. During engine start we got a Configuration Gear; TO configuration flaps EICAS during engine start. After about :10 seconds the EICAS went away. The relief pilot said he had seen a EPR spike during start and we concluded that the EPR spike had been a glitch and set off the EICAS to think we had applied takeoff power. Systems returned to normal and we continued.The departure was normal and uneventful. I was pilot flying and we used Runway XX with a slight tailing crosswind. During climb on the ZZZZZ2 departure we were turned to the north. As I had flaps retracted and accelerated I noticed a EICAS THRUST ASSYMETRY TAC. I pointed to the EICAS and continued climbing as I directed the FO (First Officer) to complete after takeoff checklist and run the checklist for the TAC (Thrust Asymmetry Compensation). At that point we noticed a red box around EGT on right engine. The engine was operating normally at that time but was about 70 degrees higher than the left engine. The red box showed we had a EGT limit during the climb. We continued climing to a safe altitude and requested a level off at 14000 and a vector clear of traffic as we worked a checklist. While ATC vectored us around traffic we got another EICAS Eng EEC (Electronic Engine Control) Mode R.The checklists had us reset the EEC switches to ALT. The relief pilot mentioned that the Eng Lin/Surge/Stall u checklist would be appropriate as we had a indication expedience. We reviewed that checklist and concluded the engine was stabilized.At this point after crew discussions and completing the tasks on the checklists I made the decision that we should return to ZZZ and land. We had stayed within 30-35 miles from ZZZ as we worked the situation. We contacted dispatch on Satcom and patched to Maintenancel. A discussion of all the faults and situation concluded in agreement with ZZZ landing as safest plan. I discussed with Maintenance that I would rather not dump fuel and if we could safely land overweight we would do that. We had Dispatch send the performance data to conclude that a safe 30 degree landing could be made on Runway XXC at ZZZ and also ensure a single engine go around with performance if it was needed. Our weight allowed this and we briefed Runway XXC; for ILS approach. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested clearance to Runway XXC.After a briefing we were vectored to join Runway XXC. I slowed the aircraft early and configured to ensure limits and speeds were safe. A heavy landing has some differences and handling is challenging. I used Autobrake 2 and Flap 30 to decrease stress on the aircraft. The landing was normal landing and I gently applied brakes and we were able to exit normally only about 2/3 of the runway. Fire crews inspected the plane and we continued to the gate.",,,,"B-777 Captain reported after takeoff an engine showed an EGT exceedance. The pilots returned to the departure station.",

While he did that I turned us back to ZZZ and setup for the approach. During this we had the Flight Attendants (FAs) look out the right wing to see if they saw us loosing fuel. The Captain (CA) also briefed them on the return and that it would be a precautionary landing. The checklist had us shutdown the number 2 engine.

The airplane used was Aircraft X; a B777-200. After climbing to our cruising altitude of FL370 and approximately one hour into the flight; while the Relief Pilot was on break; the Captain and I noticed the forward left windshield was arcing in the lower right corner. We watched for approximately 45 seconds as the arc moved from the lower right corner; up and diagonally to the middle of the windshield. Shortly after the arc ceased; we heard a loud pop and watched as the windshield began to shatter. We were not aware which layer/pane failed.At this time; EICAS messages began to appear on the upper EICAS screen and I stated 'My aircraft' and continued to fly the airplane while the Captain completed the checklists. The Window Heat L and the Window Damage FWD L messages appeared and he accomplished both checklists in accordance with Company standard operating procedures.Once the checklists were complete; we began a discussion on the need to divert and we requested the Relief Pilot return to the flight deck to help with coordination and workload management.At this point we utilized HF radio [requested priority handling] to ZZZ and CPDLC technology alerting them of our need to divert off of our assigned track. In accordance with oceanic procedures; we turned on all exterior lighting; transmitted our intentions on both and turned to begin our divert.There was a discussion about retuning to ZZZ or diverting to ZZZ1. We decided ZZZ1 would be the best option due to the forecast weather deteriorating in ZZZ. At this time; we also overheard reports of severe turbulence in the ZZZ area; so ZZZ1 made the most sense considering the situation.We were able to coordinate a descent to FL250 and requested speed at our discretion. That was approved and we descended and slowed to 280 kts. We had some time and referenced the QRH for any supplemental information that might be pertinent to our situation.We requested ZZZ1 weather and briefed an ILS XXL approach into ZZZ1. The winds were reported to be 230/23G38.Approximately 100 miles east of ZZZ1; we accomplished the descent checklist and descended to 11;000 feet and slowed to 250 kts in preparation for the arrival and landing. As a precaution; we also requested Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARF) be available on landing.I flew the approach and landing and it was normal. We taxied off of Runway XXL under our own power and subsequently parked at gate 1.I appreciate working with the FO's. At all times; they were professional and efficient in their communication. They; along with the flight attendants; did a fantastic job that contributed to a successful diversion. It should be noted that the Captain's forward windshield had been written up a week prior on Day 0 for de-laminating all corners and the Maintenance Discrepancy was put on. There was also an info to maintenance item on Day 1 of the left window heat needing to be reset prior to departure and then again in flight. Additionally; there was a separate info item to maintenance on Day 2 4 for 'EICAS window heat R side.'A thorough review and potential streamlining of the deferral process especially in instances with multiple and common write ups. A requirement to shorten deferral times in order to fix issues.",,"After leveling off at a cruising altitude of FL370 about one hour into the flight the Captain's forward windshield indicated electrical arcing in the lower right corner. This was immediately followed by a loud pop and subsequent shattering of one of the layers of the Captain's windshield. The Window Heat L and Window Damage FWD L checklist were completed and it was determined a divert was necessary. At this point via HF to ZZZ we [requested priority handling] to coordinate a divert to ZZZ1. ZZZ was considered; but a strong frontal boundary was already causing severe turbulence at 6000 ft in the ZZZ area (reported by a 737) which made ZZZ1 a better choice and a closer suitable airport. A descent off track was coordinated via HF and CPDLC to FL250 speed at our discretion with ZZZ Oceanic. Approximately 75 miles from ZZZ1 we descended to 11;000 250 kts. The First Officer (FO) landed uneventfully to Runway XXL ZZZ1 winds were 230@23 gust to 38. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARF) had been notified and were available upon landing. We taxied to gate 1 without incident.It should be noted the Captain's FWD windshield had a write-up on Day 0 for delamination and a Maintenance Discrepancy was issued. Also on Day 1 an info to maintenance report of the L window heat being reset just prior to departure and again in-flight.Differing the maintenance of the FWD L windshield delamination along with the FWD L windshield heat having a write-up with no action was the causal factor. The aircraft sat a ZZZ for 24 hours prior to this flight with adequate time to replace the FWD L windshield. If this was done it would have prevented the issue and diversion.",,"B777 flight crew reported the Captain's forward window shattered at FL370. The flight returned to the mainland.",

I quickly switch the bottom MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) from Engine to Hydraulics and saw the A system quantity rapidly dropping. I directed my FO (First Officer) to reference the QRH and we immediately shut the system A ENG and HYD pumps off. Unfortunately; the quantity was already at 17% and shutting the pumps off; did little to stop the drop. We immediately advised ATC and asked for holding while we finished the QRH and contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control. I suggested and we all agreed that diverting to ZZZ [airport] was in our best interests due to low ceiling and rain at ZZZ1 but VMC and dry runway at ZZZ; as well as better facilities and maintenance at ZZZ.  We were literally 150 miles from both airports. I briefed the flight attendants as well as explained to the passengers what was going on and why we were going to ZZZ instead of ZZZ1; and then we headed directly to ZZZ. Upon arrival into ZZZ; we had to manually configure the landing gear; so we opted to do so a little early to ensure we had enough time to fully configure so as to not need a go around because with manual gear extension; once it's down; it's down for good. We finished all appropriate deferred items on the checklist and approach and landing were both uneventful on runway XXC at ZZZ. Outside of sluggish controls and left thrust reverser not working correctly; we landed safely and taxied to the gate.

At this point; we requested to enter holding; while we coordinated with dispatch and Maintenance Control. It was agreed that we should divert to ZZZ due to weather in ZZZ1 and maintenance support in ZZZ. We ran the checklist and complied with all the steps. During the divert to ZZZ; we elected to configure early since we would have to do a manual gear extension. Configuration was uneventful; and the landing was uneventful.

Decided on a single-engine taxi. The #1 Engine was started after making the turn onto Taxiway 1. As we approached the runway; ZZZ Tower cleared us for takeoff. The two-minute warmup expired as we crossed the hold short line. Advanced the thrust levers and started to accelerate. Somewhere between 80 knots and 100 knots we started to feel a shimmy from what was assumed to be an unbalanced nosewheel--not uncommon.Over the next few seconds; the shimmy turned much more pronounced. At that point between 111 and 115 knots; the Captain decided to reject the takeoff. We rejected according to procedure; the First Officer executed his duties perfectly; and the aircraft came to a stop on the autobrakes. The Captain told the Passengers to remain seated over the PA. We set the flaps to 40 and retracted the speedbrakes.We informed the Tower of the reject and suspected tire damage. During the reject the Captain noticed a large dark object fly out in front of the aircraft and go into the grass. Airport Operations evidently found a large piece of the tire in the grass. We asked the Tower if they saw any smoke or fire; as we had no abnormal engine indications nor smoke fumes or smells in the cabin. The Tower took a closer look and said there was a little bit of smoke coming from the main gear. They called out the fire trucks and an Airport Operations vehicle was first on scene. We switched to a discreet frequency; and they informed us that indeed we had lost the left main inboard tire.At this point the fire trucks showed up and we started the APU and shutdown the engines. At this point we turned off the autobrakes and set the parking brake due to the fact that we were on a down-sloped runway and no one had any chocks. The Captain called back to the Flight Attendants to ensure that they as well as the Passengers were okay.We called ZZZ Operations and told them of the rejected takeoff and they said Maintenance is on XXX.XX nothing else. We assumed that they would call Dispatch to let them know what was going on. We put a call into ZZZ Maintenance to explain what happened. We ran the brake cooling data; and it said do not approach the gear for 30 minutes to one hour; at gate inspection needed; and 34.8M ft/lb.About 25 minutes since the reject; Maintenance showed up and informed us that they were going to replace both tires and then let us taxi to the gate. We believed towing us to the gate would be a safer option as we didn't know if there was any damage to either engine even though we had no abnormal indications. There was some confusion about where Airport Operations would meet the Super Tug but eventually it showed up.When they tried to move the aircraft; evidently the brakes on the right side had seized up. Maintenance started to work on the brakes; and the Captain discussed with Airport Operations about getting airstairs and buses to get everyone off the aircraft and back to the terminal. During this entire event; The Captain talked to the Flight Attendants and Passengers letting them know what was going on. Side note; we did get some messages from Dispatch; but because there was no chime to alert us; we overlooked them until a bit later. We kept the Passengers seated but let the Flight Attendants know that if anyone needed to use the facilities it was okay.

At that point between 111 and 115 knots; I decided to reject the takeoff. We rejected according to procedure; the First Officer executed his duties perfectly; and the aircraft came to a stop on the autobrakes. I told the Passengers to remain seated over the PA. We set the flaps to 40 and retracted the speedbrakes.We informed the Tower of the reject and suspected tire damage. During the reject I noticed a large dark object fly out in front of the aircraft and go into the grass. Airport Operations evidently found a large piece of the tire around; I think they said; about a hundred yards out in the grass. We asked the Tower if they saw any smoke or fire; as we had no abnormal engine indications nor smoke fumes or smells in the cabin. The Tower took a closer look and said there was a little bit of smoke coming from the main gear. They called out the fire trucks and an Airport Operations vehicle was first on scene. We switched to a discreet frequency; and they informed us that indeed we had lost the left main inboard tire.At this point the fire trucks showed up and we started the APU and shutdown the engines. At this point we turned off the autobrakes and set the parking brake due to the fact that we were on a down-sloped runway and no one had any chocks. I called back to the Flight Attendants to ensure that they as well as the Passengers were okay.We called ZZZ Operations and told them of the rejected takeoff and they said Maintenance is on XXX.XX nothing else. I assumed that they would call Dispatch to let them know what was going on. We put a call into ZZZ Maintenance to explain what happened. We ran the brake cooling data; and it said do not approach the gear for 30 minutes to one hour; at gate inspection needed; and 34.8M ft/lb.About 25 minutes since the reject; Maintenance showed up and informed us that they were going to replace both tires and then let us taxi to the gate. We believed towing us to the gate would be a safer option as we didn't know if there was any damage to either engine even though we had no abnormal indications. There was some confusion about where Airport Operations would meet the Super Tug but eventually it showed up.When they tried to move the aircraft; evidently the brakes on the right side had seized up. Maintenance started to work on the brakes; and I discussed with Airport Operations about getting airstairs and buses to get everyone off the aircraft and back to the terminal. During this entire event; I talked to the Flight Attendants and Passengers letting them know what was going on. Side note; we did get some messages from Dispatch; but because there was no chime to alert us; we overlooked them until a bit later. We kept the Passengers seated but let the Flight Attendants know that if anyone needed to use the facilities it was okay. At about the two-hour mark from leaving the gate; airstairs and buses arrived and we started deplaning. They unloaded the baggage and the FO and I rode the aircraft to the hangar.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a main gear tire failed during takeoff roll; resulting in a rejected takeoff.

The flight was routine throughout; the only unusual occurrence being we were assigned our slowest practical speed 300 miles out; due to holding in ZZZ. We noted that that was unusual; since the ATIS was few at 2000; 5000 broken; 9000 overcast; winds 150 at 6; 10 miles visibility. There was light rain reported in the ATIS; and a comment of rain showers distant southeast & south. Not an ATIS that would immediately cause one to think the airport was in holding. We asked the last ZZZ Center controller prior to being handed off to Approach Control why they were holding; and he said there was rain 50 miles west of ZZZ. Again; rain 50 miles away seemed not a huge impact; but I thought "must be interfering with arrivals from the west; so they are slowing everyone down". Made sense to me. Our assigned STAR was the ZZZZZX; and aside from being assigned a speed of 190 for the entire arrival; the STAR was flown uneventfully as published. When we were at position ZZZZZ1; straight south of the field; the FO commented that he could easily see the airport. We received vectors for a base turn; and the Approach Controller asked if we could see the runway. We both agreed that we could see it; the PAPI and approach lights were clearly visible; and could remain VFR easily all the way to it; so reported we did; in fact; have the runway in sight. The controller cleared us for a visual approach; and assigned us to change over to Tower at approximately position ZZZZZ2. In light of the ATIS; I had the radar on until about the base turn; but since we could see the entire airport; it seemed unnecessary for the approach; and I re-selected the terrain display due to terrain considerations in the event of a missed approach. So far; everything was completely normal and unremarkable. I disconnected the Autopilot at about 4500 AGL. Unfortunately; I don't recall if I had the Autothrottles (AT) engaged or not. The approach progressed completely normally throughout. On final approach; our entire runway; the parallel Runway XL; the terminal - all were completely visible. Everything seemed utterly normal. As we approached the FAF ZZZZZ3; I noticed there was a bit of a fuzzy characteristic to the PAPI and threshold lights; but they remained clearly visible. At no time did the Approach or Tower Controller make any comment about rain or a shower at the runway. The only information we had was the ATIS report of light rain.At approximately 300 feet; a few raindrops began to appear on the windshield. The First Officer said let him know if I wanted wipers. Within a couple of seconds; the rain intensified; and I called for wipers. What happened next was utterly unbelievable. At maybe 120 feet; the rain became a deluge! Water was sheeting up the window; and the wipers were overwhelmed. At maybe 80 feet; I completely lost any depth perception due to the sheets of water rising up the window! I tried to jump back into the HUD guidance; but I was not expecting to need it; as I would in a CAT III situation.There was a total loss of useful visual reference for maybe 4 seconds; but they were; quite literally; the MOST impactful 4 seconds of the flight! We made quite a firm touchdown; had a minor bounce; and then were on the runway and into reverse. It was the worst landing I've ever made in my 3000+ hours on the 73. Being unsure of the status of the auto throttles at this point becomes very consequential. In training; and in the AOM; we discuss the exact scenario where a firm touchdown occurs with the thrust levers not fully at idle; then a bounce; which spins the main wheels up; then retarding the levers to idle; which deploys the ground spoilers; and the classic tail strike occurs. I think that is exactly what happened on this landing - irrespective of the status of the AT engagement; I think the thrust levers did not reach the idle detent in time for the touchdown.During the taxi in; the FO and I discussed whether or not I should make a logbook entry for a hard landing. He said in his previous airline; as a 737 check airman; he had witnessed harder landings than that; and they had always turned out to be; after downloading the FMCS data; well within the limits of the aircraft. I debated with myself about whether or not to make that log entry; but we were on a re-assignment status; with a plane full of passengers and crew already boarded at the next gate over awaiting us pilots. In the subsequent hair-on-fire preparation for that next flight; the consideration of the log entry for that landing was temporarily shuffled to secondary importance.Once we were in the climbout on the next flight; shortly after transition altitude; I looked up the exact verbiage in the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook). It says 'if the pilot believes a hard landing may have occurred; an entry in the AML is required'. Just under that; it discusses thrust need not be added for a 'shallow bounce or skip'. That was our situation on that prior landing; so I felt I had complied appropriately with that guidance. The AML entry; however; I decided needed to be made. I began to compose a message to dispatch requesting the Maintenance team in ZZZ create a logbook deferral sheet item referencing the possible hard landing. Before I completed it however; I checked the routing of the aircraft; and was dismayed to see it was already off the gate and underway on a flight to ZZZ2. I was frankly unsure what to do next. In retrospect; I SHOULD have sent the message to Dispatch; to comply with FOM. Perhaps Maintenance could have arranged for the inspection at ZZZ2. We arrived ZZZ3 45 minutes late; then had an extended wait for ground transportation; and I finally stepped into the hotel room at XA:20; after expecting to be laying over in ZZZ at XR:00 the night before. I was chilled; exhausted; and feeling quite low about my horrible landing; and simply was out of gas for any further action at that point. After arising mid-morning; while getting ready to get on the deadhead flight; I checked the logbook for any issues with the aircraft. None were made; and the it had flown 4 segments; so I assumed all must be OK. I was lulled into the comfort zone of prior discussions about hard landings; both with my current FO and in previous instances of training and conversation; and the fact that most pilot perceived hard landings are; in fact; well within Boeing design limits.After landing from the deadhead segment from ZZZ3 back to ZZZ; I checked the logbook once again; and was sickened to see a logbook deferral sheet item; describing delamination and burn marks forward of the tail skid. I'm pretty certain that is the result of this incident on my flight. At least the aircraft had now been evaluated by Maintenance; and since it has continued operating; it must be within maintenance limits. Nevertheless; I feel absolutely SICK to have been the one to cause ANY level of damage to a company aircraft. I also acknowledge that; due to being well and truly tired; I failed to comply with the FOM reporting requirements.Unforecast and unreported extreme rain shaft at THE worst possible location for our approach.Suggestions: The point I want to reiterate is how completely unexpected the situation was that resulted in this irregular landing. The visual sight picture; the mild ATIS; zero commentary from ATC or other aircraft; all led both of us to believe we were on a completely normal approach. The speed at which the precipitation went from a few drops to overwhelming the wipers and causing total loss of depth perception; at literally a second or two before the flare; was unbelievable. Despite my best efforts to salvage the situation; I ended up with the undesirable aircraft state. The old adage; EVERY approach may end up as a missed approach; certainly is reinforced here. Despite having made thousands of them; the one thousand and first may be the one that bites you; and this one was mine.",,"Below 100 ft and just prior to touchdown on Runway XR a sudden water curtain came to us and diminished our visibility even with the with the windshield wipers in high; that caused to lost deep perception of the runway for a few seconds and we touched firmly with a little bounce.Suggestions: Quicker updates on weather by ATC or PIREPS to warn off the last minute adverse conditions.",,"B737-800 flight crew reported heavy rain during landing flare resulting in bounced landing and tail strike.",

This was identified as fairly common by the Captain at high pressure altitude airports and did not raise concern. We taxied to Runway XX for departure with strong gusty winds and opted to use ignition on due to wind sheer reported of 10 knot gain on final. The First Officer (FO) was the Pilot Flying (PF) and we noted a louder than normal buzz from the engines on the takeoff roll. There were no associated abnormal engine indications that would have warranted a reject. Shortly after takeoff and after gear up an "advisory" white advisory was flashing on the engine display and we noted #1 engine vibration varying from 0-9 while climbing through 7000 feet MSL.

At the moment of this occurrence; in my mind; I honestly perceived the situation as unsafe to fly; due to a possible pressurization problem; due to the high altitude elevation of this airport which is also surrounded by high altitude terrain. I was the pilot flying and rejected the takeoff. I exited the runway on Taxiway 1 and held short of Runway XL. After telling the passengers the 'this is the Captain. Remain seated. Remain seated. Remain seated.' PA; ATC allowed us to remain on Taxiway 1; holding short of Runway XL; to run our checklist and coordinate with operations to return to the gate. With the distractions of communicating with ATC; executing our pack light ON checklist; which cleared the pack light ON light; communicating to the passengers and flight attendants and coordinating with operations; at some point; I unintentionally set the parking brake. When I noticed my honest mistake; I released it. While in communication with local Maintenance on radio frequency; they told us to set again the parking brake while a gate was being coordinated for us. At that point; I began to communicate with my Dispatcher to provide an update of the situation and set a conference call with Maintenance Control. I indicated Maintenance Control that I was holding my position with the parking brake set as indicated by local Maintenance. After the call ended; local Maintenance called us and told us to release the parking brake as instructed by Maintenance Control. When a gate was available to us; I received a clearance to taxi to the gate. At that point; I realized that the airplane was not moving. I called Maintenance to come and inspect the aircraft at our position. When Maintenance arrived to inspect the aircraft; they found the number 2 tire was flat. They showed up with a tow truck to park us at the gate. The tow truck did not move the aircraft either. We coordinated to bring stairs and buses to the airplane to deplane everybody.

During the takeoff roll out of Runway XR; at around 130 kts.; we got a Master Caution; Right Pack light ON.

The winds were strong and gusting which favored Runway X. We briefed ZZZZZX arrival to Visual approach to Runway X; backed up by the ILSX. ATC shortly after cleared us to descend via and expect Runway Y. We made appropriate changes and briefed again for Visual to Runway Y; backed up with the ILSY. Descending through approximately 11000 ft.; ATC asked us if we wanted Runway Y when the winds favored Runway X. The winds were acceptable for Runway Y but better for Runway X so we asked for ILS to X. ATC then asked "so are you requesting to fly the transition for X?" We didn't understand the question and replied " transition for ILS Runway X". ATC said ok. At midfield downwind we were cleared for the visual approach to Runway X. I armed the approach and turned base leg approximately 8 miles out. We set the altitude at 6300 ft.; the altitude for the faf. The wind was quartering tailwind as we were on base. We were descending too soon and even though we didn't go below the FAF altitude; we were low. ATC advised us of an altitude alert. We said we had the terrain in sight and continued. As we approached LOC intercept I noticed the localizer did not capture the course and we flew through the course. I corrected to back across final for the Loc to capture. It did not. While this confusion was goin on the strong winds quartering behind us were blowing us through the the course and we descended towards the 6300 ft. we were farther out then I thought. We continued to fight the this approach. We never got the approach function to work. We were high on glide path as we approached the runway and unstable. I executed a go around. We were halfway through the procedure and Tower told us to go around. We had not told him that we were already going around. They vectored us around the pattern to Runway X again. We completed litanies and checklists and set up for the same approach. This time the same thing happened. The Approach would not capture. I asked the FO (First Officer) to check the ATIS to see if ILSX was out of service. It was. We were on final approximately 7 miles out on final. I turned off the Autopilot and the flight directors and hand flew a raw data Approach. Before Landing checklist was completed and we were stable before 1000 ft. Then landed and taxied to the gate.Number one factor is not reading the complete ATIS. There is no excuse for this. Second factor is ATC must have been able to see our mistakes were possibly because we were trying to fly an approach that was inop and said nothing. Third factor is FO on probation with low time/experience.All this would have been avoided if I read the ATIS completely. All this could have been avoided had ATC suggested "localizer out of service" when they saw we were not performing as normal. This could been prevented with a FO with a little more experience. The FO does a great job but there is no substitute for experience. In 25 years at Company I have never had to go around on a visual approach because of this type of scenario. It's humbling that making such a simple mistake can start an avalanche.",,,,"A319 Captain reported receiving a low altitude alert from ATC after becoming low on an approach while being confused with the approach automation.

This went away within about 60 seconds but happened again about 4 more times. During these events; we noticed an IAS difference of about 5kts between the Captain and First Officer (FO) sides. I contacted dispatch and got a phone patch with Maintenance. I briefed Maintenance on the situation and they suggested we continue but monitor the instruments. During this time; we reviewed the airspeed unreliable checklist but we still were not sure who had the unreliable airspeed. After the third event; I opened the airspeed window and slowed down and then sped up about 15 knots each. We observed that the FO IAS indicator did not move but the Captain and standby indicators followed the speed changes appropriately; telling us that the FO side was unreliable. I then swapped rolls to become flying pilot and gave the radios and monitoring pilot duties to the FO. We ran the checklist for unreliable airspeed. Once we started our descent into ZZZ1; the FO airspeed indicator dropped to 45 kts and the FO altimeter stayed about 1;000 ft. higher than the Captains and the standby.

Flight Attendant (FA) 1 came from the forward cabin and informed me that we will be returning back to ZZZ because of a landing gear issue. The Captain [requested priority handling] however he said there was no need for an emergency demo. My inter-phone was not working after takeoff. I was not able to hear the call from the Captain or Purser at the overwing exit. FA 1 stated that we had 10 min and that the Captain would make an announcement to the passengers. I immediately got up from my jump seat; took out my manual and went to my Emergency Procedures Chapter. I then started to prepare the cabin. Approximately 5 min later; I was now in the aft galley - Purser 2 called and spoke with FA 3. FA stated the Captain has [requested priority handling] and that we will need to brief the passengers. We all retrieved our safety equipment and proceeded to our assigned demo positions. The Captain made the announcement informing the passengers of our return to ZZZ Airport.

ATC instructed us to descend and maintain FL280. At that time I input FL280 into the MCP (Mode Control Panel); the Captain verbally verified the altitude input; and selected ALT Intervene to begin the descent. The thrust levers; with A/T (auto throttles) engaged; began to retard to Idle.  Moments after; the Captain and I noticed a vibration that lasted a brief moment. The vibration stopped after maybe 3 seconds and we asked each other if the other felt it- which we both confirmed. We both looked at the gauges and instruments; showing nothing un-ordinary. Moments after; I called out 'master caution' as it illuminated. The Captain noted and pointed out ENG FAIL on the engine indication DU. The EGT started to rise while the thrust was still idle and we were still descending to FL280. To confirm the engine had failed; the Captain increased the right thrust lever ever so slightly and noticed no response of engine indications. With the EGT redlining; the Captain suggested he needed to shut down the engine; I concurred.The Captain performed immediate action items and then called for the engine failure checklist from the QRH. Looking through the options on my EFB; I selected 'engine fire or severe damage' checklist because of the vibrations we felt; I presented the Captain with the checklist for his confirmation; and began reading.After the 4th step of the checklist; the Captain told me to continue with the checklist as he began other tasks; such as communication with ATC and beginning a mild drift down with data from the FMC. I continued with the checklist; reading and communicating every action out loud. I advised the Captain the last step was to land at the nearest suitable airport and the next checklist was the "One engine inoperative landing".In the meantime; the Captain had already [requested priority handling] with ATC and had been exploring divert airport options. He advised me that he was thinking ZZZ1 was a good option. We looked at the current weather at ZZZ1; discussed the lack of terrain and elevation; the distance from our current position; and runway/approach applicable. We agreed it was an excellent option. The Captain instructed me to resume the radios; I advised ATC of our request to land ZZZ1 to which they cleared us direct. The Captain communicated with Dispatch who agreed with the plan. The Captain then called for the. "One Engine Inop Landing" checklist. I ran the checklist out loud again; confirming with the Captain.The Captain then communicated with the Flight Attendants and requested that I build the approach. Once the approach was built; I briefed the Captain on the ILS X into ZZZ1; followed by the deferred descent checklist. We received vectors for the approach; the Captain made a very smooth landing; taxied to the gate; and we ran the shutdown checklist.",,"We were cruising towards ZZZ at FL300 over northwest Location A. We received a descent to FL280 slightly ahead of the flight plan for reported turbulence ahead. We were using VNAV so I used altitude-intervene to start a cruise descent. The FMC switched ahead into VNAV descent mode. The relevant factor here is that the FMC commanded idle thrust to descend. I set to work on recruising the box.Just as the throttle was about halfway back we experienced a mild airframe vibration ZZZ3ting for a few seconds. I paused and asked the FO if he felt it. He said he did. It was slight; like a cooling fan making noise; a loose panel; or gear door vibrating in the wind. I looked at the engine indications but they were normal. Engines frequently shake slightly as they spin down so that was another possible explanation for the vibration. A few seconds later the FO alerted me to a master caution. I looked around and saw ENG FAIL overlayed on the EGT display. The EGT was rising. N1 on both engines had come back to idle as commanded by the FMC; fuel flows were low and matched; no engine or airframe vibrations existed anymore; and we had good oil pressure and temperature. The EGT was now stabilized above redline. I was hesitant to treat it simply as an Engine Limit Surge or Stall since I was perplexed to see ENG FAIL in combination with high EGT and low fuel flow. I considered possibilities like a faulty EGT sensor. Since I didn't even really know if the engine had failed; I cracked the thrust just off the idle stop watching fuel flow and EGT closely. There was absolutely no response. Something was definitely wrong. I considered the failure and overtemp indications to be reliable.I decided it had to be shut down and conferred with the FO. I called for the Engine failure Shutdown Checklist based on the ENG FAIL condition. Step 1 refers to vibration and; having previously disregarded that as normal and unrelated; we reconsidered. The abnormal indications appeared very soon after the unexplained vibration so severe damage seemed likely. I called for and performed the engine fire severe damage immediate action items. At that point I divided duties. I flew and talked to ATC. The FO ran the Engine Fire Severe Damage Checklist. It seemed like a natural division of work since I was already flying. I wanted something specific from ATC so I took the radios too. I looked up driftdown speed and altitude; declared an emergency; and obtained a descent clearance to FL230. There were clouds below FL260. Not wanting to descend into ice I opted to drift down slowly; set max continuous thrust; and let ATC know what we were doing. I chose to defer calling for the Driftdown Checklist to prioritize handling severe engine damage.Then I took a look at nearby airports on the MFD (Multi-Function Flight Display) and my EFB. By this time we were into Location B and ZZZ1 was barely further away than ZZZ2. ZZZ1 weather was good and ZZZ1 was also preferable to ZZZ2 for field elevation and terrain. ZZZ3 was further away than ZZZ1. Behind me were regular airports ZZZ4 and ZZZ5; but these have elevation and terrain. ZZZ6 was a close airport but it doesn't have long runways and we hadn't computed landing distance per the checklist yet. It also has high elevation and nearby terrain. I considered the time it would take to complete all checklists as well as terrain; field elevation; my familiarity; and weather. ZZZ1 was the best option. The FO liked the plan so I got a turn towards ZZZ1 and asked ATC to pass along to Dispatch what we were doing. Dispatch sent me a voice frequency (ZZZ Radio) via ACARS. I briefed Dispatch and told him our plan for ZZZ1. He had no objections so we continued. I gave the purser a brief and instructed her not to prepare for evacuation. We set up for the approach and I directed the FO to brief it. I made a PA to the passengers apologizing for the delay to ZZZ due to engine shutdown and emphasizing a normal landing in ZZZ1. We finished the Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist and landed flaps 15 from vectors to ZZZ1 ILS Runway X. I never saw a need to run the Driftdown Checklist so I never initiated it; rather opting to manage flight path via normal means.We received a gate assignment about 10 minutes before landing and passed it along to ATC at crash-fire-rescue's request. Landing was normal so I released crash-fire-rescue and taxied to the gate. Maintenance found broken metal debris in the tailpipe of the #2 engine. There were no injuries.",,"B737 flight crew reported engine failure during cruise descent. Flight crew shut down engine and performed a diversion and safe landing.",

Approximately 30 mins into my crew rest within the second half of the duty period I was notified to come back to the flight deck to discuss an issue with the two Relief Pilots. This was an OE (Operating Experience) Qualification Line Check segment with the student as well on rest.Upon arrival on the flight deck I was informed of a leak in progress within the center hydraulic system at a rate of 1% per minute. At the time of the initial brief on the issue the quantity was approximately 64% and showing RF with no associated EICAS messages. I confirmed the loss rate while the two Relief Pilots reviewed the Hydraulic Quantity (HYD QTY-L (C; R) QRH procedures as well as in the event of total loss of quantity the (767) HYD SYS PRESS-C (Only) procedures with me. I concurred on the their assessment of needing to address the current quantity issue and preparing for the possibility of a total loss of Center quantity into a Center Pressure loss procedure.At this time I reassumed the left control seat and initiated a SAT call with dispatch and Maintenance Control. We gave an update on current conditions related to the center system and the aircraft overall. While Maintenance Control reviewed systems affected; a fact that we the flight crew had already reviewed; the loss rate continued. it was at the point I reminded the Maintenance Control we did not have time for his review due to the continued loss of fluid and were going to initial the HYD QTY-L(C;R) procedure for the center system despite not having the associated EICAS messages to retain what fluid remained. When asking Maintenance Control if there were other options the response was they would only point us to our procedures. No additional insights/procedures were offered by Maintenance Control. During this call it was also discussed we would continue to ZZZ Airport and not request priority handling just yet given operation of 2 system and no reliance on backup systems as well as the current QRH procedure not stating to land at nearest or similar verbiage. All concurred on assessment. Although we did state we will look at advising ATC once we were into domestic/arrival airspace due to possible loss of all quantity leading into the pressure QRH.Once off the SAT link; we executed the HYD QTY - C QRH procedure down to the deferred items. At this point the center quantity was at 58%. With the aircraft in a safe configuration for continued flight with little degradation to controls etc; I stepped back to the rest seat for about an additional hour to assure some rest. Instructions were given to monitor and advise if loss resumed and I then proceeded to brief the student who was in 1A. That discussion was his qualification line check was now incomplete due to the issues at hand and he would be assuming a relief pilot seat while I assigned the right control seat to one of the Relief Pilots given extensive experience in the aircraft and the possibly of a non-standard approach to landing. I also took the opportunity to do an initial brief with our Purser and gave instructions to pull his final service earlier to assure in seats 1:30 prior to estimated arrival.Upon that brief rest culmination I returned to the flight deck to assume the control seat and also alerted the student to return. At that point we still had 58% in the center position and in safe configuration for continued flight. The two Relief Pilots cycled to the lavatory and all then took appropriate seats.The plan was brief based upon the quantity QRH to execute a 15 mile final turning on the center system per the deferred items and then extend flaps/gear on associated flap speeds to try to protect the quantity dropping to zero and getting a subsequent pressure EICAS directing us to a second; more intensive; QRH procedure. We also reviewed as a crew the HYD SYS PRESS-C QRH in expectation we may get it if quantity would not hold. The principle operational difference between the two were approachflaps and speed (normal for the QTY QRH procedure; the other F20 VREF 20 for the PRESS procedure) as well as a alternate extension for gear and the flaps/slats once in the PRESS procedure. With all in concurrence with the 'game plan' I then briefed the Purser with additional details. The FAs (Flight Attendants) at this point were complete with final service and proceeding to secure for arrival at approx 1:45 from arrival. When transferred to ZZZ Center; we advised ATC and facilitated routing followed. At this time a passenger PA was made addressing a hydraulic system deficiency and we would continue to ZZZ airport and would keep them appraised of changes. Decision was also made to deactivate WiFi leveraging the instructions posed by our  FOM but used to control information flow from aircraft that may hinder perspectives of current disposition and support of the flight and passenger.A second call was then made to Dispatch; Maintenance Control and then added the Chief Pilot prior to advising ATC. I reviewed the state of the aircraft; actions currently taken within the HYD QTY QRH and our decision to let ATC know as well as research options. We ruled out our initial alternate and looked at ZZZ1 airport (runways shorter than what we would like have seen) and then decided on ZZZ3 airport in the event our flaps/slats were not able to get to either our planned F25 approach under the QTY QRH or the F20VREF20 if needed in the PRESS QRH. There was some confusion explaining our current QRH for QTY allowed for normal operations versus the PRESS QRH dictating non-standard configurations. We settle on an estimate distance 5500-5700 needed for a F20VREF20 approach if ending up using the PRESS QRH. Although that would fit in ZZZ airport we determined less threat existed with longer surfaces in the event of other issues arising. The Chief Pilot concurred on our assessment. A final PA was made to the passengers to assure them of safe conditions and appreciation of their calmness and discretion.Once being vectored for ILS Runway XXL I noted the fuel quantity was approximately 14k. We had determined that 10.5 was our go point to ZZZ3 airport and our final reserve fuel was rounded up to 5K vs calculated 4.8k. At this point fuel was not becoming a consideration in planning and execution of procedures.At approximately 17 miles out while on an Intercept with a 'speed our discretion' clearance; F1 was called with the status page up to monitor C HYD QTY. We noted a significant hit to our QTY that was up to 63% at that time to approx 30%. With that information the decision was to drop gear while QTY and PRESS were still available. The gear did a normal extension but again took the QTY down to approx 15%. F5; F15; and F20 were all commanded while reducing airspeed. It was then; while on the localizer we saw the split flap/slat display and the system still at F1 settings. We also concurrently had the HYD PRESS C EICAS now displayed resulting in a forcing to that QRH. Actions were then taken IAW (In Accordance With) the QRH but in a hurried fashion given now descending below 3000 ft LOC and GS. Ground Prox Overide was pushed; ALT Flaps/Slats armed; and ALT selector set to F20. No response was noted for the next few minutes and a decision was made to execute a level off and missed approach.The relief pilot now operating the aircraft hand flew a level off while MCP (Mode Control Panel) was reset to disconnect from the GS/LOC. Vectors were made to the west. We re-accomplished the tasks in the PRESS QRH to no avail on movement of the flaps/slats. I then decided to take the flap handle from the F20 position; pick it up out of the detention; then re-affirm it back into the detention. It was at this point the flaps began the movement to F20. We reconfirmed speeds/gear/flaps and commenced an intercept of both LOC/GS.At around 1500 ft agl I reviewed with the right seat the F20 picture out the window differences and airspeed/float that could be expected.A normal approach to landing was made favoring a slightly low GS to attempt to maximize runway availability. A slight float occurred but touchdown was made within the zone. We executed full reverse and manual braking holding reverse longer that standard to assure stabilized tracking since nose wheel steering may be affected. We stopped just before Taxiway 1 on XXL. During the rollout the student was instructed to countdown the last 4k of runway to assure awareness and the second Relief Pilot in the middle JS (Jump Seat) was backing up awareness of systems operation. At this time fuel was approximately 10.3 that correlated with our go ZZZ3 airport decision point. Of note during the GA procedure the gear was not/could not be retracted due to the PRESS situation. Burn was above 15-16k during the re-vectoring when level. Upon stopping I held the brakes vice setting while fire rescue inspected and established communications. Decision was made to remain on runway due to brake temps possibly needing addressed by fire rescue and the possibility of not having/losing NG steering. Maximum brake temp culminated at 4.1 on wheel #1 with wheel #3 next at 3.8. No temps above those were noted. Fire rescue checked aircraft and found no fires or deflation of tires. At that point we executed the after landing but left the flaps down in the event of an evacuation being needed for unforeseen reasons. Once tug was on site we execute the tow procedure then relived control to the tug driver and pulled safely into the gate. During these process appropriate call were made to FAs; passengers; and other entities.We arrived at the gate and executed the parking checklist; executed an extensive debrief where we found our CRM to be essential to this safe outcome. I then instructed the student and non-control seat Relief Pilot to take hat and jacket and assure the passenger saw them as they deplaned.Several departments came onto aircraft for a quick inject. We then left the flight deck and debriefed the FAs thanking them for their coordination/synchronization and outstanding efforts.",,"Approximately 30 mins after the Captain and trainee FO went on their break we noticed a slowly decreasing center hydraulic quantity at a rate of 1% per minute. At the time of the initial brief on the issue the quantity was approximately 64% and showing RF with no associated EICAS messages. The other FO and I agreed that this was a critical issue; and we called the Captain back to the flight deck while reviewing pertinent checklists and systems. Upon his return we all confirmed the loss rate and we reviewed the Hydraulic Quantity (HYD QTY-L (C; R) QRH procedures as well as in the event of total loss of quantity the (767) HYD SYS PRESS-C (Only) procedures with the Captain; who concurred on the our assessment of needing to address the current quantity issue and preparing for the possibility of a total loss of Center quantity into a Center Pressure loss procedure.At this time the Captain reassumed the left control seat and initiated a SAT call with dispatch and Maintenance Control.

By turning off all center system pumps; the pressure went to zero and the quantity stopped decreasing; as we expected. At this point the center quantity was at 58%. With the aircraft in a safe configuration for continued flight with little degradation to controls etc; the Captain stepped back to the rest seat for about an additional hour to assure some rest. Instructions were given by him for us to monitor and advise if loss resumed and then proceeded to brief the student who was in 1A.

The gear did a normal extension but again took the QTY down to approx 15%. F5; F15; and F20 were all commanded while reducing airspeed. It was then; while on the localizer we saw the split flap/slat display and the system still at F1 settings. We also concurrently had the HYD PRESS C EICAS now displayed resulting in a forcing to that QRH. Actions were then taken IAW (In accourdance with) the QRH but in a hurried fashion given now descending below 3000 ft LOC and GS. Ground Prox Override was pushed; ALT Flaps/Slats armed; and ALT selector set to F20. No response was noted for the next few minutes and I advocated for and the Captain agreed that a go-around was our best course of action; as we did not have performance for a flaps 1 (or less) landing; so the decision was made to execute a level off and missed approach.As PF; I executed a 'soft go-around' and hand flew a level off (without hitting the GA Switch; which would have just added to the confusion and degraded safety at that point) while the MCP (Mode Control Panel) was reset to disconnect from the GS/LOC. Vectors were made to the west. We re-accomplished the tasks in the PRESS QRH to no avail on movement of the flaps/slats. The Captain then decided to take the flap handle from the F20 position; pick it up out of the detention; then re-affirm it back into the detention. It was at this point the flaps began the movement to F20. We reconfirmed speeds/gear/flaps and commenced an intercept of both LOC/GS.At around 1500 ft agl the Captain reviewed with me the F20 sight picture differences and airspeed/float that could be expected. A normal approach to landing was made favoring a slightly low GS to attempt to maximize runway availability. A slight float occurred but touchdown was made within the first 1000 ft zone. We executed full reverse and manual braking holding reverse longer that standard to assure stabilized tracking since nose wheel steering may be affected. We stopped just before taxiway 1 on Runway XXL. During the rollout the student was instructed to countdown the last 4k of runway to assure awareness and the second Relief Pilot in the middle JS (Jump Seat) was backing up awareness of systems operation. At this time fuel was approximately 10.3 that correlated with our go ZZZ2 airport decision point. Of note during the GA procedure the gear was not/could not be retracted due to the PRESS situation. Burn was above 15-16k during the re-vectoring when level.Upon stopping the Captain held the brakes instead of setting them while fire rescue inspected and established communications. Decision was made to remain on runway due to brake temps possibly needing addressed by fire rescue and the possibility of not having/losing NG steering. Maximum brake temp culminated at 4.1 on wheel #1 with wheel #3 next at 3.8. No temps above those were noted. Fire rescue checked aircraft and found no fires or deflation of tires. At that point we executed the after landing but left the flaps down in the event of an evacuation being needed for unforeseen reasons. Once tug was on site we execute the tow procedure then relived control to the tug driver and pulled safely into the gate. During these process appropriate call were made to FAs; passengers; and other entities.We arrived at the gate and executed the parking checklist; executed an extensive debrief where we found our CRM to be essential to this safe outcome. The Captain then instructed the student and non-control seat Relief Pilot to take hat and jacket and assure the passenger saw them as they deplaned.Several departments came onto aircraft for a quick deberief. We then left the flight deck and debriefed the FAs thanking them for their coordination/synchronization and outstanding efforts.",,"B767 crew reported a gradual loss of center system hydraulic quantity during last half of cruise flight.

During climb out from ZZZ airport; I elected to turn on the weather radar as it had become dark and there were clouds building along our route and WSI had shown radar returns along our route in northern flight path pre departure. The radar failed to turn on; followed by a WXR FAIL message on the Captain side ND (Navigation Display). I double checked the settings on the Weather Radar Panel. All Weather Radar Mode Switches were set appropriately; however; there was no tilt control; nor any gain control (the Gain Uncalibrated lights remained illuminated no matter the gain position) from the Weather Radar Panel. Selected the WXR switch on the FO EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System) Control Panel and had the same WXR FAIL message. At this point; I transferred radio duties to the FO and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control via the Crew Phone. Spent a few minutes discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and we determined that the entire radar system was inoperative to include the predictive wind shear system. The dispatcher and I agreed that with the weather in the ZZZ1 airport area we needed a functioning weather radar. Dispatch advised they were going to discuss the issue with Maintenance Control and the Coordinators and would possibly have us land short of ZZZ1 and try to repair the radar before continuing the flight. Shortly thereafter; we received an ACARS advising of a return to ZZZ airport to swap aircraft. During this exchange; the FO and I noticed a mild burnt bread smell. I called back and discussed the smell with the #1 Flight Attendant to determine if we were smelling the ovens or not. After we turned the flight around; we smelled the odor again; and again; I discussed things with the flight attendants in more depth and we were able to determine the smell was not coming from the ovens or the forward galley. With this new information; the FO and I discussed the odor was possibly associated with the failed radar. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control again to advise of the development. Maintenance Control wanted to give it a 10-15 minutes and see what happened as it was intermittent. Dispatch and I agreed as we were equally split between ZZZ airport and ZZZ2 airport and could divert to either if the situation worsened. I informed Dispatch that it was my intention to advise ATC and attempt to get back to ZZZ airport. We advised ZZZ Center and proceeded direct to ZZZ airport as fast as we safely could. After advising; we noticed the odor a few more times; again highly intermittent and only lasted a few seconds. As we were landing over weight; when we talked to ZZZ approach; we elected to land the runway closest to our gate (XXR/Gate X) and requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting). Approach and landing were uneventful; ARFF met us after we cleared the runway and followed us into our gate.",,,,"Air carrier flight crew reported on departure the entire weather radar system was inoperative with weather along the route.

Flight departed from ZZZZ normally; normal climb out and reached cruising altitude of FL 340. Flight coasted out normally and was in ETOPS airspace. At Approximately XA11 heard a bang noise followed by 2 concurrent messages. Engine 2 stall and Engine 2 high vibrations. We followed procedure and reduced thrust on number 2 engine.. messages immediately disappeared and all engine parameters were observed normal again. We called back to get our 2nd officer off break and back up into cockpit. We returned thrust lever back into the climb detent and parameters remained normal. At XA13 a second engine stall and high Vibe occurred. this time we reduced power again and parameters returned to normal however this time we kept the power reduced enough to hold altitude and we quickly discussed a possible return and decided to start our offset to 5 miles anticipating a most likely return.

As we were on 10nm final at ZZZZZ fix we received a master caution light for Flight controls. I immediately looked up and saw the Flight control light illuminated as well as the Pressure Differential and yaw damper. Shortly after the Autopilot B disengaged by it self. Due to an MEL; the Captain elected to fly this leg on Autopilot command B; as an extra caution to make sure the airplane is on the correct course. Captain immediately took manual control and requested I reference the QRH non normal checklist for Feel Differential pressure. After completing the checklist; Captain requested that I reference the QRH for YAW damper light. I went back to the Flight Manual (FM) Non normals and did Yaw damper checklist. checklist directed me to place the switch back ON and to wait and see if the light extinguish. The yaw damper light did in fact extinguish; and I completed the Yaw damper checklist. At that point the Captain requested to start configuring the airplane for landing. As I selected flaps 5 the master caution light illuminated for flight controls again and I immediately identified the caution to the Captain; at the same time as I looked up at the overhead panel I noticed the yaw damper light illuminated again; but this time it was accompanied with 'low pressure' light for hydraulic B; and this was the first time this has illuminated; and no hyd caution annunciator . At that point we also noticed that the flap indicator didn't move or change and stayed at zero. The Captain decide the best course of action was to execute a go-around to trouble shoot. We executed the procedure for the go around and inform ATC about the go around and ask for vectors. After we leveled off the Captain gave me the control and radios while he performed the non normal checklist for 'low pressure' of Hydraulic B. He completed the Loss of system B checklist. After he completed the checklist we transferred the flight controls and I ask for vectors to Runway XXC ILS approach and landed safely. After we got back to the gate we debriefed it on what went well and what could have gone better.Later during the day; the Captain spoke with Maintenance and after a quick review they didn't detect a hydraulic leak or failure. However one possibility that could have caused the loss of hydraulic B; was the accidental placing of both Hydraulic B pump switched to the off position.Due to the proximity and similarities of the engine anti ice switches with the hydraulic B switches could have led to the mistake; also with all the distraction due to weather; turbulence at the critical times; could have Lead to mistakenly turning off the Hydraulic B pumps.",,"B737 flight crew reported multiple equipment failures during descent to land.",

I went to check and found what appeared to be hydraulic fluid wearing from the actuators.  A ELB entry was made.  Local maintence had us pressurize the system and operate the roll input.  About 10-15 full deflection inputs were made and the writeup was cleared.  (A system hydraulic level was slightly lower than B.  A had about 83% vs B at 90%.)Normal F25 takeoff was performed; with aircraft wt about 150;000#.  On climb out noticed the aircraft had a slight tendency to roll left.  There as a noticeable dead spot between 2 units left of top to top on the yoke; which had very little roll to the aircraft.  Forces past top to the right were stiff and noticeably more force than normal was required to get the aircraft to respond.Climb out and initial cruise were performed in the center of airspeed window.  Pitch and rudder inputs/ responses were normal.Decision was made to proceed to ZZZZ vs ZZZZ1 due to runway length; aircraft weight; and airport resources. [Priority handling requested] with ZZZ Center.  Dispatch was contacted via SATCOM and a phone patch to Maintenance Control was initiated.  The situation was discussed; and I told Dispatch that we would contact them shortly to discuss the plan of action with the Chief Pilot.  The Chief Pilot was contacted about 30 minutes after takeoff and we coordinated our game plan to continue to ZZZZ.The F/O and I discussed the checklist; passenger instruction; F/A awareness; and course of action into ZZZZ.The F/As were to remain seated except to prepare the cabin for arrival. A briefing was given first on the intercom and later in person prior to descent.   No passenger services were to be performed.  Passengers were seated except for a 15 minute period prior to top of descent for lavatory usage.RNAV was to be performed to [Runway] XXL as the ILS was OTS.  XXL was chosen due to runway length.  The field was sighted 40 miles out.  Being restricted to the RNAV was the only quandary we had as the FM directed A/P and A/T off directly contradicts the FM guidance on A/P usage during a NP (non-precision) approach.  Fortunately ZZZZ was VMC that evening. Flap 15 landing was performed.  Right roll past center was noticeably more difficult at the slower speeds.Normal touchdown and rollout.ZZZZ aircraft rescue and firefighting directed us to stop on the runway for an aircraft inspection.

We promptly followed and completed the [priority handling] procedure in the Flight Manual (FM) and I informed dispatch with the Maintenance Control on the line. We collectively agreed it was wise to return to ZZZZ; [requesting priority handling]. We adjusted our course away from the present track; coordinating with ZZZZ1 to proceed towards ZZZZ2 FIR.

The crack was not there prior to takeoff.  The crack started small but expanded and grew rapidly.  By approximately 7000 feet the crack grew across the entire windscreen on the FOs side.  At that time we leveled the aircraft in order to handle the situation.  The Captain spoke with ATC and decided to return to ZZZ [airport] and [request priority handling].  The landing back at ZZZ was uneventful.",,"During climbout a crack was observed in the first officers windscreen. After completing the after takeoff checklist I noticed that a 6-8 crack had formed in the lower left hand corner of the First Officers windscreen. I had not noticed the crack when I reached from the autobrake selector to the Engine Start Selectors. After completing the checklist I noticed the crack had formed so I believe that it happened while I was reading the checklist. When I asked the FO when it happened he had not noticed the crack yet. When I brought it to his attention we were climbing through around 5000 feet for 10000. As we were climbing ATC cleared us to FL230 zero; I told them we were going to request 10000 as a final for now and would get back to them. They inquired if we needed any assistance and I told them about the crack windscreen and that we would need a minute to get back to them. I was about to have a discussion with the FO as to whether or not to level off now; go to 10000; and whether or not to continue/divert. About this time I watched the crack immediately go from one corner of the windscreen to the other. I instructed the FO to level the aircraft as we were at 7000 and notified ATC that we were leveling at 7000. The aircraft went up to approximately 7450 before we came back down to 7000. I then asked ATC for lower to reduce the pressure differential on the windscreen and told ATC we would need a few more minutes; but would most likely be diverting to ZZZ [airport] due to the crack. I had a very brief discussion with the FO about the decision and we were both in agreement to return to ZZZ. I notified ATC and asked for a lower altitude again to decrease the differential pressure. We had another brief discussion about the location of the crack and we both agreed that the crack had formed on the outer pane. I elected not to run the damaged windshield checklist due to the close proximity of the ZZZ airport and the knowledge that the checklist would have given us the option to continue normal operation with a crack on the external pane only as this would have most likely added an additional time to the flight and I was still concerned that the crack would continue to get worse. I also elected not to run the Off Schedule Decent checklist as I knew the system assumed we were returning to the departure airport. During decent I [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) in case we had a catastrophic failure of the windscreen and there was potential for an overweight landing. At this point I began notifying dispatch and the flight attendants as to what was going on and that we were returning to ZZZ. I also made a PA to the passengers as well. After briefing the passengers I briefed the approach and got landing data which was faster to look up than it was to wait for the ACARS to return the landing data I requested. At this time ATC was giving us box vectors over the final approach course. Autobrakes 3 allowed for plenty of margin to land the aircraft at our current weight via the chart so we used that and then I completed the Decent Checklist. I then took control of the aircraft from the FO and completed the approach and landing without incident. After taxiing clear of the runway I had ARFF inspect the brakes and made another PA to the passengers as to what was going on as I thought we had landed overweight for a -900; we were however in a -900ER which I could not find a way to differentiate as the release said B739. So we were not actually overweight for landing. ARFF stated the brakes were warm; but not abnormally; so we elected to coordinate with ops and taxi to the gate. While we were attempting to make contact with operations the FO reviewed the window damage checklist and found that it would have lead us to turn off  the window heat which was the only thing on the checklist we did not end up completing. After attempting to contact ops via radio; telephone; dispatch; and ATC we received no response. I requested that we taxi to our gate of departure which was next to an aircraft ops was working; this was the only time operations realized we had returned and were then able to park us. While the passengers were deplaning I made phone calls to Dispatch/Chief Pilot/Maintenance Control; input write-ups into the ELB (Electronic Log Book) and then debriefed the situation with the First Officer.",,"B737-900 flight crew reported on departure the FO's windscreen cracked resulting in a return to the departure airport.",

The fire indicators had been going on and off in the flight deck for the cargo which initiated setting off the extinguishers and other cooling measures on the aircraft. The IFE (In Flight Entertainment) and other electronic controls were not working due to overheating. We were told there was a possibility of a ditching as the weather was too poor in ZZZZ1 to land there and they weren't sure what our options were. Meanwhile the galley was secured and power turned off. It was then decided we were to land in ZZZZ as a precautionary landing. The pilots informed the passengers that there was signs of smoke in the cargo and we would be diverting to ZZZZ and landing in 25 minutes. The crew prepares the cabin for landing as usual and took our jump seats. Upon landing [priority handling] vehicles were there and inspected the aircraft for probably a half hour. I smelled smoke but later was informed it could have been from the cargo extinguishers. They couldn't detect any heat from the outside so the aircraft was deemed unnecessary to evacuate. Then we parked the aircraft and had to wait about another half hour for any busses to arrive to deplane the passengers cabin by cabin to get in the busses. That took probably an hour. Then the crew deplaned. We sat on the bus for probably another half hour and firefighters came on saying they had only found evidence of condensation at that point; no fire. We were told we would not be getting back on that aircraft and our new plan was to lay over for the day and take the passengers in a new plane to ZZZZ2 at XA:00 pm; lay over for 28 hours and ZZZZ3 back to ZZZ (and they reflected that). Customs agents weren't there quite yet so the customs process took a very long time. I believe we got to the airport hotel at XB:45am. We were given minimum rest. We were told pickup was XB:30pm. There were very few food options around. I didn't hear anything from anyone until about XB:15pm the purser called my room informing me we were staying the night and leaving in the morning and he would give me more info shortly. 10 min later the FO called my room and said we were leaving tonight and come downstairs asap. At this time I found out the passengers had been flown to ZZZ1 earlier in the day in a plane flown in from ZZZ1. We all went to the airport where customs had gone home so we had to be escorted through the airport and then driven 4 at a time to the plane where maintenance was still working and they were still taking the cargo off. I was not asked if I was willing to work the original plane we had flown in. During that time a cargo pod of okra was taken out of cargo that was smoking and smoldering and hot to the touch. The pilot went out to investigate but it had been taken away. After probably an hour and a half on the aircraft I think we took off for ZZZ1 around XC:30 in the morning. Landed in ZZZ1 around XE:30 or XF:00 am where we went through customs and went to the hotel shuttle area to then be told there weren't enough rooms at the hotel so the captain called hotel limo and we split into two groups.

Near XA15 during conversation with the captain; I mentioned feeling pressure changes in my ears and noticed the pressure gauge showed the cabin descending at a rate of around 300 feet per minute while we were still mostly maintaining a cabin altitude of ~8000 ft. I thought this could just be an indication error in the analog gauge. However about 15 minutes later we received several EICAS caution alerts in rapid succession. Within a few seconds I saw alerts for the aft bulk cargo door; forward cargo door and emergency doors not being properly secured. Then there were a series of aural alerts and several more EICAS cautions changing and happening too quickly to remember. My immediate thought was that a rapid decompression was imminent and wanted to descend - so we asked the flight attendants to take their jumpseats. It was unclear which checklist to run given the multiple cautions but I decided on the emergency doors checklist since that was the alert that I noticed for the longest time; while the captain referenced the aft bulk cargo checklist. We were at the same time observing pressure bumps and quick changes in the pressure gauges. Both decision trees led us to descending to 14;000 ft and a similar resolution so we asked for and received vectors from ZZZZ control for the descent and [requested priority handling].

I told ATC we needed to descend to 14;000 and for a vector off the airway (at 14;000 the cabin pressure stabilized and there was no need to go to 10;000). I checked the grid altitudes in our area and we were on a safe track. I called dispatch and informed the what was going on and the patched in Maintenance Control. The FO was wanting to start another checklist and I told him to keep flying the airplane.  We didn't need two people running checklists and no one flying.  It took a while to get the other FO in as there were so many things happening that we couldn't take time to let them in. The purser called and said door 2L was making a horrendous noise. I had the Relief Pilot call the purser and make a PA.  Purser reported that the PA was very weak; so we had them talk to the passengers.  I conferred with dispatch to go to ZZZZ [airport] and ZZZZ1 [airport] as a back up to that if needed. I coordinated with dispatch to get our info to ops in ZZZZ. Dispatch was very helpful and a huge asset to us. I talked to the purser and gave them the briefing info. We then did a thorough approach brief and discussed our threats and flight path forward.  We landed 7;000 pounds over max landing; which we thoroughly briefed.  We insured all checklists we complete and had a normal approach and landing.",,"I was about an hour into my rest period when I was awakened to return to the cockpit for a diversion. The Captain and relief officer briefed me about the indications they had received about several doors showing open and about the cabin pressurization climbing at about 500 feet per minute. They had initiated a descent according to the checklists to 14;000 feet when I resumed my duties as first officer. We discussed possible diversion airports and gathered the weather and info for each ZZZZ [airport] was determined to be the most suitable airport due to the facilities available and its proximity to our location.We coordinated with ATC while the captain also communicated with dispatch; Maintenance Control and the cabin crew. I set up the FMC for arrival into ZZZZ and communicated with ATC. The relief officer coordinated with the cabin crew as well as making announcements to the passengers.Once we began the descent out of 14;000; we checked to ensure that all of the required checklists had been accomplished. The cabin descended normally after we went below 9;500 feet. No other errant indications were received for the remainder of the flight. Throughout this process; each time there was a break in activity; we came back together to catch each other up and make sure we were all on the same page. Having completed all of the necessary items; we continued to ZZZZ and flew the ILS XX to landing.",,"B767 flight crew reported several indications of open doors and pressurization failure resulting in a diversion.",

The fire extinguishers were deployed below; which the crew could hear in the front of the cabin. Due to these cooling measures; the IFE (In-flight Entertainment) overheat warning light came on; and we soon lost the IFE system and WIFI.  We began to prepare the cabin; shutting everything down in the galleys; all while trying not to alarm the passengers. While waiting for more information from the cockpit; we began looking up ditching procedures in our manuals to mentally prepare. Pilots informed us we were diverting to ZZZZ1 with a precautionary landing. On descent; the plane could not fuel properly. It was communicated to be prepared to look for any smoke or fire upon landing; and possibly evacuate by slides. Upon landing we were met by vehicles who inspected the aircraft before we could deplane. The deplaning procedure was to be with the XL door deplaning in sections by ramp stand; while all of the crew manned our doors in the armed position. It took hours to get buses; deplane; and go through customs with all our passengers.  Many of our passengers were asking us what to do; as the company had communicated nothing to them. While all together; we were told by ops that we would continue on to ZZZZ that evening with the passengers; on a new aircraft; have a 28 hour layover; and deadhead back. This was agreed upon as we all had time to decompress; rest; and felt safe on a different aircraft. We were given a minimum rest day layover; with our schedule showing we were continuing on to ZZZZ that evening.  There was no communication from the company; until a hour before pick up; when our schedule changed to ferry the same aircraft to ZZZ1 instead of continuing to ZZZZ. This was not the agreed to decision. After being rushed to the aircraft; we then sat for roughly three hours; as the plane was not ready to leave. Time that should have been spent in our hotel rooms; decompressing from such a traumatic experience. Coincidentally; because we were on the aircraft; we were present when cargo containing it taken off that was still smoking; and hot to the touch; 18 hours or so after the fire was first detected. The cargo was carted off with no further inspection of the heat and smoke source. This is incredibly unsettling. When we reached ZZZ1 at XA:15 in the morning; we did not have hotel rooms; and were once again given a minimum rest layover. At no point did the company reach out to me; there was no debrief; and to my knowledge there was no follow up on the cargo. Suggestion: Please consider having Airlines report the reason for any and all diversions; complete with inspections. Furthermore; if a fire extinguisher is deployed; please ensure reports and investigations are mandatory. The company completely dismissed us; and we have not heard anything on an investigation into the cause and findings in the cargo.

Aircraft X had previously flown in the morning; but it was the first flight on the aircraft for us. We started #2 and single engine taxied to Runway XX. We started #1 and had our two-minute warm up requirement. This takeoff was planned with Windshear Advisories in effect and was a max thrust takeoff at around 102.5 N1. Takeoff was uneventful. About 25 to 30 minutes after departure climbing through FL260 we experienced a #2 engine failure. First Officer was the Pilot Flying and I; Captain; was the Pilot Monitoring at the time of the occurrence. The #2 Engine banged loudly followed by vibrations. I quickly scanned our engine gauges and observed a red EGT indication and Engine Failure Alert on the #2 Engine. I directed FO to continue flying while I further analyzed situation and announced the condition and appropriate QRC. Due to the loud bang and vibrations as well as red EGT digital readout; I suspected that we had severe engine damage. I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center; briefly described our situation; and requested them to stand by. We performed and completed the QRC "Severe Engine Damage;" as trained. We did not have a fire indication or overheat so we did not fire the bottles. At that time; I questioned the severe damage; due to the fact that we had N1 and N2. My initial assessment was that it was severe; so I proceeded with the most conservative option. We then proceeded to the QRH. We; at that point; assessed our position and diversion plan and determined that ZZZ was the nearest and most suitable airport with weather and NOTAMs.I requested delayed vectors to continue our preparations and checklists. ATC began to vector us (heading and altitude) for landing at ZZZ. Once we completed the QRH critical items; FO and I transferred controls and I became the Pilot Flying; FO the Pilot Monitoring. FO did an exceptional job completing the remaining QRH Items and required performance data for the diversion preparation and brake cool module. During the vectors; ATC brought us parallel to our final approach course with anticipation of vectoring us around until we were ready. This caused the FMC course to dump the approach. We noticed this and had to reload and re-brief the approach adding additional work and possibility of errors. FO did a great job in quickly reprograming and verifying its accuracy. Once our checklists were completed and all notifications to Flight Attendants; Dispatch and Passengers were completed we advised ATC that we were prepared to continue for Single Engine landing in ZZZ; with emergency vehicles standing by. We were at this time in contact with ZZZ Tower; who vectored us very close to VFR traffic in the area. This caused a TA. Knowing that I would not receive RA guidance (QRH step); I elected to react prior to ATC instructions and immediately deviated left of instructed heading to avoid traffic that was climbing and indicated 700 ft. below us. FO quickly advised Tower of our new heading in which ATC had no problem with. We were re-vectored to final and had an uneventful landing on Runway YY. We exited and requested Fire Assistance to walk around our aircraft and assess any other conditions that we may not be aware of. We got the "All clear" and we parked uneventfully at the gate in ZZZ. Maintenance Logbook entries were completed.",,"I was the Pilot Flying on Aircraft X on (Day 0). This was our third flight of the day; ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. Departure from ZZZ1 was normal with VFR weather conditions. Our incident occurred approximately 25 minutes into the flight. While climbing to our filed cruise altitude we experienced an engine failure. Climbing through FL260 we heard a loud bang; followed by airframe vibrations. The aircraft yawed to the right. As Pilot Flying; I immediately took control of the aircraft. The Captain immediately announced; "#2 Engine Failure". I Disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles and leveled off at FL260 to stabilize the aircraft. The Captain notified ATC and assessed the indications. I observed a red EGT gauge; no N1 and no N2 on the #2 Engine gauges. The Captain began to run the QRC; and we followed procedures to secure the No. 2 Engine as we began a descent. The Captain then assessed our nearest airports. We were familiar with the weather and airports in the immediate vicinity. After checking the weather and NOTAMs we decided that ZZZ was the best course of action; as the weather was VFR; and it was also an online station. The Captain notified ATC. The Captain continued with the QRH while I handled the aircraft and took a vectored descent from ATC. The Captain finished the QRC critical items; spoke with the Flight Attendants and made a PA to the Passengers. Once he completed those tasks; we swapped PF and PM roles and began to set up for the approach at ZZZ. I then notified Dispatch through ACARs and requested Fire equipment to be standing by. We continued with the Appropriate QRH checklists and completed the Diversion Plan on the X section of the checklist card. We also ran landing data; brake cooling numbers; and discussed that it would not be an overweight landing. When we felt confident that we had completed all required tasks and made all necessary notifications we advised ATC that we were ready for an approach. On downwind ATC notified us of VFR traffic that was climbing in our vicinity; and that they were not in contact with them. We advised ATC that we would be making a left turn to remain clear of traffic to avoid a climb maneuver while single engine. Once clear ATC vectored us for the approach. We landed uneventfully. We then pulled off the runway and had Fire Rescue assess the aircraft's condition. Once we got the "all clear" from them; we proceeded to the gate.

I thought the Captain had dropped a water bottle on the floor; but I also felt almost imperceptible yaw. We immediately looked at the ECAM and saw that engine 2 had automatically reduced itself to idle; with all other parameters normal at that instant. However; this was quickly accompanied by ENG 2 Stall ECAM. The Captain immediately assigned me to continue flying duties while he completed the ECAM. Because the EGT was climbing rapidly and out of limits; we followed ECAM procedures to shut down engine 2. [Requested priority handling] and we were cleared directly to the airport. The Captain checked FM non-normals for ENG 2 Stall and reviewed notes warnings and cautions. He then notified Dispatch; completed a briefing with the flight attendants; and made a passenger PA. After a discussion with the Captain; we decided that he would be pilot flying for the landing. We were set up originally to land on runway XL; however they offered us landing on XX to expedite our arrival. We accepted this; and I verified on the landing distance non-normals table that this would be acceptable with the wind component. We were cleared directly to a fix on the ILS; which we briefed. However after arming the approach; it became clear to me that the localizer was not reliable. I loaded the RNAV XX in the box to give the Captain backup guidance; although we were visual with the runway at this time. We were cleared for a visual approach. I queried ATC if the localizer was active for XX; and they turned it on. After receiving positive identification; I reloaded the ILS and used this to backup the visual approach.

I stated continue. Shortly after rotation; FO Noticed and stated airspeed wasn't right. I saw his airspeed was indicating approximately 120kts and rolling back. I did a crosscheck against both my airspeed and the standby instruments. Noticed the standby speed tape was also at approximately 120kts and rolling back. My airspeed indications were increasing and matching ground speed. I took control of the aircraft and pitched 10* and n1 80%. Airspeed unreliable memory items were actioned. The FO then sourced the QRC FOR AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE. At approximately 1500 ft. we [requested priority handling] with Tower and requested vectors for the ILS XXL. We then went to the FM (Flight Manual) Airspeed unreliable check list.  Climbed to 5000 ft. per ATC.  Upon level off noticed FOs airspeed around 110kts and altimeter reading 300-400 high. Standby speed indicating 60kts. Verified my airspeed with a crosscheck of both ground speed and ATC. Sent a diversion report to dispatch and briefed the Flight Attendants.  We then re-recruised the aircraft and performed the descent checklist; followed by landing checklist. On final approach noticed standby airspeed at 0kts and FOs IAS at 60kts. Landed ZZZ [airport] ILS XXL.Upon arrival at the gate we did a parking checklist. We were then meet by a mechanic and discussed our situation. He mentioned that there were a lot of bugs flying around; today. I then tried to enter the manual code for AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE; however; I kept receiving a fault message. I then followed up with dispatch and the Chief Pilot.  After consultation with the Chief Pilot; we were informed that there would be a crew swap. We remained on the aircraft for approximately 30-45 minutes. During; this time we kept the passengers apprised of the situation; and that a new crew was inbound to take the flight to ZZZZ [airport] in approximately 1-1 1/2 hours. Upon leaving the aircraft I went outside to talk with the mechanics and inform them I was unable to enter a manual code. I used one of the mechanic's tablet and wrote up; airspeed unreliable; FOs and standby indicator.",,"I did the walk around prior to this flight. I did not see anything on or around pitot tubes. I was PM on this segment. On the take off roll above 100 knots the auto throttle tripped off. The Captain reached up and tried to reengaged it at that point; but it did not reengage. He called continue; so we continued take off roll. Shortly after taking off; I noticed my airspeed was not reading right.  it was right above berber poll. I cross checked with my Captain's instruments and his instrument was reading reasonable airspeed; so I handed him the control. At some point of this process of accessing whats going on; the shaker started vibrating. We quickly executed memory items for unreliable airspeed; and communicated to ATC that we were [requesting priority handling] and needed to come back to ZZZ [airport]. We requested vectored for ILS XXL at ZZZ. We requested to maintain 5000 feet; and as the airplane leveled off; we noticed that my side of altimeter was reading about 300 feet higher than the Captain side. While we were being vectored around; we accomplished QRC and QRH.  Captain also communicated with FAs and passengers around that time. Then we set it up for ILS XXL and did a quick briefing on that; and accomplished descent checklist. On the final; my side of airspeed went into the berber poll and the shaker was reactivated until we touched down. The landing checklist was accomplished in timely manner as well. Because we contacted ops before initiating the approach and told them that we were coming back; the ground crew were all ready to have us into the gate.

Discussed landing overweight with FO. I thought we should land right away since the checklist said to land at the nearest suitable airport. FO concurred. Discussed flap settings. Elected to use flaps 40 for slower landing speeds and because the ATIS winds were light right down the runway (XX/YY). Planned VREF was 150; auto brakes 2.  Required landing distance was 7600; with usable length of 10800 on [Runway] XXL.  Asked for XXL for longest runway. After getting the landing data we set up to come right back and land overweight.

My reaction was to execute the cabin rapid depressurization memory items followed by the reading of our QRH. The accomplishment of the immediate memory items by the Captain followed by the QRH read by First Officer in concurrence with the Captain. For us our priority was to aviate; navigate and then communicate. Because of the recognition of loss of pressurization and the constant sounding of the Horn and the attempt to control the cabin pressure by closing the outflow valve. We requested a lower altitude; however; due to the loud noises in the cabin and the use of oxygen mask; although we as crew had already established communications. The ATC  Controller couldn't hear our request for lower altitude. Which led her to [request priority handling] for us. To which we agreed and at the same time we continued our descend to 10;000FT as per the QRH.

We performed the ECAM actions. As expected; the ECAM switched from LO LVL to LO PR. Since there was no applicable QRH; we went through the manual procedure (HYD Y RSVR LO LVL; since that was the main/root issue). The manual pointed out the possibility of losing yellow accumulator pressure; so we started a timer (as per the manual procedure) to check the accumulator pressure later. It turned out that the accumulator was holding pressure normally. The manual procedure also stated there was a possibility of fuel consumption increased; if the spoiler's panel lost (2 and 4) were not completely retracted. On the F/CTLs synoptic page; the depiction indicated that the failed panels were in the completely retracted position and there was no 'FUEL CONSUMPT INCRSD' in the ECAM Status; but we wanted to be sure. We called the Flight Attendant (who was already aware of the issue since she called us to report service was done) and asked if they could verify if the spoilers were flush. Because they were not assertive in their answer; we decided that I should go back to the cabin and verify it. I did it and we ruled out the fuel consumption increase/fuel penalty factor. We kept track of the fuel consumption fix by fix and it was consistent with the flight release. We ran landing performance numbers on our EFB and the results were compatible with landing in ZZZ [airport]. We then decided to continue the flight to destination and communicated the issue and the decision to Dispatch; asking them to make arrangements for our tow to the gate. The captain made a PA to the passengers letting them know we would have to be towed to the gate after landing. Meanwhile; we started to get repetitive ECAM alerts (HYD Y RSVR LO LVL); so we decided to cancel it. Later on the flight; we decided to call dispatch and ask for ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) services to be standing by; just as a precaution for the (remote) possibility of fire from dripping hydraulic fluid onto the hot brakes.

As we received position and hold on runway XX; we obtained an amended takeoff clearance to turn on a heading of 140 and climb and maintain 4;000'. Take off roll was normal; and immediately after liftoff; we received a momentary "takeoff warning".  I promptly verified that the speed brake handle was fully forward in the retract position as I remembered this was an issue with the micro switch; and I also verified that the flap handle was in the Flaps 5 detent. The takeoff warning only lasted approximately 3-4 seconds; and we continued to climb to the assigned altitude and heading. At this time; I noticed that the flap indicator had a split; I believe the right flap was at 5; and the left flap was less than 5 with a definitive split. I instructed First Officer to turn on the autopilot. I immediately informed the tower that we had a mechanical issue with the flaps and would return to the airport; so I [requested priority handling]. We requested vectors to give us time to work on the checklists; coordinate with the flight attendants briefing and send a message to dispatch via the "Divert" function on the ACARS. First Officer continued to fly the aircraft and communicate with the tower while being vectored. I ensured that one of us remained in "Terrain" due to the terrain in the area while the other had "WX radar" active due to the storms near the airport. Fortunately; the initial heading kept us away from any terrain. I proceeded to the Non-Normal checklist and determined the issue was "(NG) Flaps Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry" Non-normal Checklist. I petitioned ATC that we needed the straight in ILS Z XX.  They asked if we were ready to proceed; and I replied; "No;" as we needed vectors (time) to prepare. While First Officer continued as pilot flying and I pilot monitoring; I completed the following necessary tasks: Non-normal checklist; loaded the approach and extended off the farthest waypoint; set VREF 40+30 plus wind additive; re-cruised the VNAV; briefed the approach; briefed the FAs; etc. Upon completion; I stated that I was ready to transfer controls to execute the landing.  As I took control; I instructed the First Officer to double-check and verify that I completed the necessary checklists; including the landing distance assessment due to the high approach speeds and runway conditions. We also asked for braking action reports; which were reported as "Good" by an Airbus 320.  I asked for the "DEFERRED items" checklist and gave the Double Chime indicating imminent landing. We informed tower ATC that we were ready to commence the approach and to have equipment standing by. We broke out about 600' on the ILS and landed smooth and firm with Max reverse thrust and MAX Autobrakes. We exited the runway at taxiway 1 and requested the equipment to follow us to the gate to ensure no issues with our brakes or tires. I also requested a thermal scan of the brakes; to which they replied that it was "normal". Operations had us park at the gate; which was not operational. After completing the parking checklist; I made the necessary ELB (Electronic Log Book) right-ups; one for the Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry Log and another for the overweight landing log.  Interestingly; the flap indicators at that time showed both flaps with no split at flaps 2; our detent that was dictated in step 1 of the Non-normal checklist. I had a debrief with the First Officer and thanked him for his expertise.  I contacted Operations; who informed me that they were bringing portable stairs to the aircraft.  I explained to them we were at a non-operational gate. Therefore; I requested a gate change with a working jet bridge to offer egress. After the stairs were installed and the main cabin door opened; the gate agent and mechanic wanted to speak to me and entered the flight deck. The mechanic wanted the failure details; and the gate agent requested "on/in" times. After talking to the gate agent and the mechanic; I went in the forward entry and made a PA to the passengers; briefly explaining what had happened without giving too many details. I kept it simple to reassure them and mentioned that we were in the process of getting a new gate.  I asked the flight attendants to give the passengers whatever snacks; drinks; or water. I used the First Officer's phone to call Dispatch. In hindsight; I learned that I should have called the Chief Pilot first. The Chief Pilot called the First Officer's phone to speak to me. (The first officer has an international data plan; while I did not).  I do not recall the name of the Chief Pilot I spoke to; I should have written it down.   After talking to Dispatch; I talked to Maintenance Control via the mechanic's phone and gave them the details of what happened. Throughout the time on the ground; I had difficulty communicating with the ZZZZ [airport] Operations due to language barriers and their slow response as I insisted on a gate. Maintenance continued to complete the tasks set out by Maintenance Control. I asked if the mechanics physically looked at the flap transmitters; wiring; rigging; etc.; and their reply was they were doing a BITE (Built In Test Equipment) test via the avionics bay while running through each of the flap settings. As time progressed (it was approximately an hour since I blocked in); I kept requesting a gate due to the long tarmac delay. Another gate finally opened; but we had to wait for another air carrier to vacate. When it was time; I told the passengers to take their seats; and we were towed to the gate. Then; all the passengers deplaned. Maintenance continued running tests and eventually signed off the paperwork. As my adrenaline began to drop; I realized that I was physically and emotionally drained from the experience.  I asked the First Officer how he was doing since I did not think it was best for me to continue. He conveyed that he was fit to continue. A deadheading pilot; a Captain B; offered to inquire to see if he was legal to fly. I decided to call Crew Scheduling to inform them of the situation and request a pilot change because I was physically and emotionally drained.  Scheduling asked when I would be fit for duty; calling out numbers; i.e.; 10hrs; 11hrs; etc.; frankly; I was so drained; I replied 10.  They scheduled me to deadhead back to ZZZ [airport] the next day. I asked if I could fly back to ZZZ later that day. Then; I realized I could ride the jump seat on the flight; basically swapping positions with Captain B. Scheduling and I conferred and chose the jump seat option on the flight. They instructed me to notify them when I landed in ZZZ [airport]; which I did later that evening. I asked Capt. B if I could fly in the jump seat and he said yes. The gate agent offered me the Deadheading captain's seat as an option; but I elected to remain in the jump seat just in case any problems developed again; I felt I could assist. Once we got confirmation that Capt.  B was legal and could fly the trip; I went up to the gate; received my jump seat pass; and made a public announcement to the passengers that I would no longer be the captain of the aircraft and Capt. B would be in charge. We flew back to ZZZ without any further issues.

We reviewed the MELs; most were just placards; but one: 36-11-XX-X specified a unique procedure regarding the high pressure valve. We briefed the OEB61 Issue 1.0: CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT and determined that if an excess cab alt alert appeared that we 'may unduly disregard the CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT alert; or delay the start of the emergency descent when recard. The captain performed pilot flying duties while I performed Pilot monitoring duties. We followed the procedure for the MEL's procedure on taxi and takeoff; and climbed out normally. We reached cruise at FL340; shortly after cruising for a few minutes; a CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT message appeared on the ECAM. We evaluated the message; compared it with the OEB (Operations Engineering Bulletin); determined the message differed from the OEB. Within about 20 seconds of this message; the Flight attendants called: the captain took the message in which the flight attendants indicated that their emergency light for pressurization was going off; aural warning for depressurization was going off; and it was communicated that they might be having a depressurization issue in the cabin. Following this information; we immediately put our oxygen masks on; the captain indicated for me to take the flight controls; descend; and request that ATC give us a descent and a turn back towards ZZZ.  We came to the conclusion that based off the CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT; the aural and visual warnings in the cabin; and the desire for the safest outcome; we agreed to descend to 10;000 feet to assure the safety of our crew and passengers. We were overflying our OA1 point and decided to [advise ATC] to remove any altitude or heading restrictions and allow us to return back to ZZZ rather than diverting towards ZZZ1. We agreed that given the stress of the situation and the possible safety risk of our passengers that reconvening in a holding pattern at 10;000 feet would be the safest decision to safely aviate the aircraft; determine our best course of navigation; and later inform ATC of our plan. Once we reached 10;000 feet; ECAM messages cleared and our pressurization gauges indicated normal operation. We held for about an hour to burn off enough fuel to get the aircraft below the max landing weight. We briefed over our plan; updated our route; and checked in on the well-being of the each other; our flight attendants; and the passenger on board. We notified dispatch; ATC; and made sure all of the appropriate sources were properly notified. Once below our max landing weight of 145;505 lbs; we notified ATC that we would like to head back to ZZZ. They rerouted us to allow us to safely navigate back to the airport at 10;000 feet; and joined the ILS via a few fixes and radar vectors. We landed safely and taxied back to the gate as if it were a normal operation. We debriefed the situation and determined that heading back to the airport was still the safest decision and were ultimately happy with the outcome of our decision-making.",,,,"A320 First Officer reported a pressurization alert resulted in a diversion to a safe landing.

Take off runway was XXL. After takeoff and shortly after gear retraction the following EICAS messages displayed: GEAR DISAGREE; GEAR DOORS; and APU Fault. EICAS gear Indications showed the nose gear up and locked; but both left and right main gear remained in the "cross hatched" in transit position.  Vibration of the aircraft was indicative that gear(s)/door(s) were not up and locked.  The status page also confirmed the APU had auto shutdown. ATC was notified.  A request was made to level at 10;000 ft and vectors in order to trouble shoot.  Airspeed was kept at 250 knots or below throughout. [Advised ATC] in order to facilitate the requested altitude and delayed vectors in high density airspace.  As per training in a "non-normal" scenery; aircraft control and radios were transferred to the FO while the relief pilot and Captain ran appropriate checklist; and conferred with dispatch and Maintenance. As a result; the determination was made that the aircraft should return ZZZ. The flight attendants were notified and passengers were updated numerous times throughout the event. Further discussion between dispatch and the crew resulted in the decision to dump fuel in order to place the aircraft closer to maximum landing weight due to reasons such as; possible main landing gear integrity; main landing door(s) stuck in a full down position; and high crosswind/gust being reported at ZZZ.  ATC was advised. The aircraft was climbed to 13;000 feet and vectors were issued toward the fix ZZZZZ over the water.  Fuel dump was conducted via appropriate checklist. Upon completion; ATC assigned routing back toward ZZZ for an ILS approach to Runway XXR.  The approach was briefed as per SOP; to include the potential to proceed to a longer runway and more favorable wind conditions at ZZZ1; if necessary.  As requested; ATC assigned a lower altitude/airspeed in order to extend the gear early; in the event there was a need for completion of any further required checklist; should it be necessary. Once the gear was lowered; indications showed showed all down and locked.  A normal landing to XXR was conducted. The aircraft was cleared from Runway XX Right and Left; eventually onto Taxiway 1 for gear inspection. Crash fire and rescue confirmed that the left main gear door was in the full down position. The aircraft was taxied uneventfully to the gate.  Maintenance confirmed the left main gear door was in the full down position; hence the EICAS DOORS light.  Of particular note; throughout the evolution; the captain justified all decisions and consulted with the crew for input throughout. The relief pilot was a great asset; with continuous involvement in completion of checklist; monitoring the pilot flying; keeping the cabin crew/passengers updated; and backing up the control seats.  A thorough post flight brief was conducted by the crew as per SOP as well as a briefing with station maintenance team that met the aircraft.",,"After gear retraction during takeoff several EICAS messages came on.

We felt a vibration or "rumble" in the aircraft; confirming that a gear door may be down. The Status page confirmed that the APU had auto shutdown. We took off with the APU on as per MEL on the aircraft. We asked to get vectors and hold to run checklists and communicate with company; and then plan to return to ZZZ. We maintained 250 knots. I transferred control of the aircraft and ATC communications to the flying F/O while the relief pilot and I ran the appropriate checklists. We contacted Dispatch and maintenance control spoke with the purser and  briefing and made several PA's to the passengers. We decided to dump fuel after a discussion between the crew and dispatch. The decision was due to possible gear integrity; gear door position and strong gusty crosswinds at ZZZ. We [advised ATC] and requested place to dump from ATC. We climbed to 13;000 ft and dumped our center tank fuel close to the ZZZZZ fix; referring to the appropriate checklist. Then turned back to ZZZ. We extended the landing gear early to ensure that we would have time to address any further issues with the gear. The landing gear extended normally and indicated that it was down and locked.  The GEAR DOORS EICAS remained. We made a normal landing on RWY XXR at ZZZ. Crash Fire and Rescue vehicles were standing by. We cleared the runway and taxied to the gate without trouble. The crash Fire and Rescue team as well as maintenance confirmed that the left main gear door was down while the right one was in the up position.

Captain was the pilot monitoring and the first officer was the pilot flying. These duties remained for the entire flight. Climbing through 10;000' MSL Master Caution light illuminated with ENG and associated ENG 2 OVERHEAT. QRC procedure was executed and the light extinguished at roughly 50% n1. We [advised ATC] an immediate turn back to the airfield. The QRH was then completed with the #2 engine planned to remain at 40%. The aircraft remained at 11;000' receiving radar vectors while the remaining checklist were completed. During this time the Non-Routine Landing Considerations Checklist was accomplished. ACARS code was used to notify dispatch of the situation and the airfield returning to. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was requested with ATC. The flight attendants received their brief of a Precautionary Landing; and the passengers were given a brief PA of the situation and that safety vehicles would be present for an inspection upon landing. The aircraft was then prepared for the RNAV (RNP) X Rwy XXR from ZZZZZ [waypoint]. Due to the high airfield temperatures and elevation; a flaps 15 landing was planned for incase of a go around with reduced thrust from the #2 engine. ATC gave a descent to 8;000' and clearance was given for the approach. Shortly after the aircraft slowed below commanded flap speed and the increased thrust was not sufficient in level flight. The aircraft descended to regain airspeed; and ATC gave a new clearance to maintain 7;000' until ZZZZZ still cleared for the approach. Airspeed was quickly regained and not a factor for the remainder of the flight. During short final the crew received several 'glide slope' aural warnings. This was due to having an ILS frequency tuned to a runway not in use. This was acknowledged; disregarded; and the aircraft never left stable criteria. An uneventful landing was made with the aircraft stopping next to the '3' board where ARFF was positioned. A PA was made to reassure the passengers of a brief inspection and to remain seated.  There was a brief delay in being able to reach the fire commander; but eventually the aircrew and fire command were able to establish communication on a dedicated frequency. Fire command used thermal cameras to verify there was no fire threat and the aircraft was able to safely taxi back to the gate with 2 engines. The aircraft executed a 180* turn on the runway per ATC's instruction and fire command followed the aircraft back to the gate uneventfully. This was a repeat write-up with the exact scenario occurring just two flights before. This was the first time we were operating this aircraft and upon preflight inspection we found loop B on the ENG 2 OVERHEAT inoperative. Contract maintenance was brought out and MEL'd loop B with loop A still functional. We had the discussion in our departure briefing to be prepared for this overheat condition; since no actual bleed air leak was found or fixed in the logbook; only the engine core fire detection system was replaced. After the flight; we were able to go outside with the mechanic and see the engine cowl. The QRC/QRH procedure was adequate for the most part. Had the OVERHEAT light remained illuminated the QRH directed to 'Go to the ENGINE FIRE or Engine Severe Damage or Separation Checklist.'

After discussion we decided to Monitor; get the checklist ready and begin looking for possible diversion airports. We also sent a message of Dispatch to keep them informed. Shortly thereafter the quantity dropped to 5; the reverse coloring appeared on the display and we began to notice a fluctuation of about + - 10 PSI of the oil pressure. We [notify ATC of our situation] and requested to vectors to ZZZ. I began to read the Low Oil Quantity Checklist but had to discontinue it due to our close proximity to ZZZ and the amount of tasks left to handle. The quantity dropped to 4 just a minute or two after and the Captain asked me to [request priority handling]. We were given radar vectors to ZZZ. The Captain continued to fly and communicate with FAs (Flight Attendant) and PAX (Passengers) while I handled ATC; Dispatch and the box. Dispatch was able to send us a release and weather for ZZZ. All normal checklists were completed on schedule. As we were below 10000ft; the quantity dropped to 1qt. I elected to have the ENG Shutdown checklist up on my iPad ready if we have to shutdown. We also started the APU. We quickly discussed the possibility of delay vectors if we had to shutdown but continued towards the airport. At some point below 1000ft the oil quantity blanked out. We touched down shortly after uneventfully and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was waiting for us. Once we exited the runway they approached the aicraft and confirmed oil streaks along ENG 1. We shutdown the ENG immediately upon confirmation. We taxied to Gate XX and accomplished normal shutdown procedures. After shut we noticed that Oil quantity on ENG 1 increased to 3qts. The difficulty with an unplanned diversion and lack of time cannot be overlooked. It was difficult to accomplish all tasks in a short amount of time. It also felt like we were racing against the oil quantity. I feel that one thing we could have done to help the situation was reduce ENG 1 to idle. That may have bought us some more time and reduced the "racing" or "running out of time" feelings I'm sure we were both feeling. The idea had come through my mind but I didn't speak up as we were both heavily task saturated and I did not want to stress the Captain any more.",,,,"B737 First Officer reported loss of engine oil quantity during cruise.

The first officer and I would describe the abnormality as if you were to abruptly step on the left rudder pedal and create a quick; hard yaw to the left. There were no ECAM notifications and we checked that there were no abnormalities to any of the system pages.  The only "normal" indication we noticed was whenever the aircraft yawed to the left; the rudder on the flight control page respectively moved with it.  The yawing moment started out with a frequency of every 10-15 seconds and our concern grew as the frequency became closer together.  The first officer took over the flight controls and radios and I called dispatch to notify them of the abnormality.  They instructed us to check both autopilots and manual flight and unfortunately the condition continued.  After disconnecting with dispatch; the frequency continued and we decided the safest option was to divert to the closest airport.  I spoke with flight attendants asking if they felt the disturbance and they said they felt it but wasn't that aggressive in the cabin.  ZZZ was roughly 50-60NM off our nose so we started the diversion by notifying ATC; going through the diversion checklist; notifying dispatch via ACARS; setting up for the approach; notifying the customers and briefing the flight attendants if condition escalated.

So we coordinated the night prior to meet at the airplane in lieu of operations. My commute in to the gate was delayed. There was a longer than usual delay waiting for the bus from the employee lot. Known crew member resulted in a random selection. During this I noticed a last minute aircraft swap and resultant gate change. That information changed my transit to the gate and that transit on the 'people mover' was crowded and slower than usual. At the gate the manager had to brief me on approx 5 LEOs (Law Enforcement Officers). Once I got down to the airplane; two flight attendants advised me of 2 different write up's that needed to be addressed before departure (flight attendant jumpseat cushion and 5 inop direct TV screens). A third flight attendant advised me via inter phone as I sat down that the lav needed to be serviced.  It was then that I started to try to download the new release for the new airplane and read the MEL. We were already boarding. Our normal preflight was then disrupted by approx 5 LEOs  (Law Enforcement Officers) coming in succession to the cockpit to check in.We put in chat and called to ops for lav service. The FO had already called maintenance for the jumpseat issue before my arrival. Maintenance was on the scene quickly and above average. They very quickly addressed all of new issues and then; because they happened to be there; discussed the MEL for ENG 1 loop B. We all looked at the fire panel and noted that despite the MEL; BOTH was selected on ENG 1. With review of the MEL and with maintenance concurrence; I selected loop A; it and tested successfully. The maintenance rep had a new maintenance release for us immediately as the write up's were addressed.Additionally; during all this; the ground crew was attempting to connect unsuccessfully using multiple ground to cockpit alerts and use of hand signals to establish comms. The lav service also required multiple calls to the back and calls to ops to see if it had been accomplished.With numerous interruptions we completed our pre-flight briefings. Ground headset communication continued to be a problem with many interruptions. At one point somebody signaled the FO to release brakes with hand signals; counter to the ground communications that had just finally been establish.The primary threat briefed was that this was a very busy push; and mitigation was to slow everything down; which we did. We ended up blocked out 1 minute late. The normal runway XX was closed resulting in a high density taxi environment and wait time. On departure we were kept level multiple times below 10k for long periods on vectors.Above 10k; things resumed to normal. Not long after we notice a solid master caution. The system annunciator was not illuminated. After searching quickly for the cause of the master caution unsuccessfully; we depressed the recall. The OVHT/DET (Overheat Detector) was then illuminated. Looking at the fire panel the Engine Overheat light was then observed. We then actioned the immediate action items. On reaching idle the light remained illuminated. By this point we had slowed our ascent; transitioned above 18; and had to start interacting with ATC for a level off and return [requested priority handling]. By the time we got to the QRC/QRH and started to go to the engine shutdown checklist; the light extinguished. QRH directs that the engine be run at a thrust level that does not illuminate the overheat light.QRH complete; we transferred controls to the FO. I sent an ACARS to dispatch; gave the flight attendants the brief stating that this would be a normal landing and not anticipating an evacuation. I asked that one of them to visually check the left engine and call back only see if they saw anything unusual. I then made a PA.With discussion we elected to keep the engine running at idle and use it for landing; while briefing actions that we would take if the light reilluminated and forced an engine shutdown. We reviewed landing procedures; including engine failure/shutdown on final.After reprogramming the FMC I attempted to get landing data for ZZZ for an overweight landing. It kept returning an error code regarding being the correct aircraft. I'm not sure if this was normal or I was doing something incorrect. In the process of reviewing single engine landing I looked up the landing distance in the non normal configuration chart for flaps 15; saw that it was more than adequate for planned runway XYL; selected max auto brake and continued.My formal brief for the descent and approach was disjointed and not very comprehensive; briefing things more as they came up on the arrival. That was an error from the threat of constant distractions.The support from the FO was honestly outstanding and far above his part 121 experience. He brought up several pertinent issues at appropriate times; had a calm; helpful demeanor; flew the airplane well; and was absolutely methodical with checklists and procedure.During the arrival we transferred controls back to the left seat. It was then that I realized I had not actually looked at the overweight considerations in the FM and asked my FO to quickly review those to make sure we had not missed anything. While the FM discussion on overweight landings is good; it is not suited to a return environment. A QRH or supplementary procedure with bullet points would be much more useful than a several paragraphs of a long discussion.The small difference between on speed and max flap speed was alarming to see. Even a minor gust could have resulted in flap load relief and mandated a go around below 500'; and bringing power up to go around power on an engine that could go into overheat would have been uncomfortable. I had elected to make the approach at flaps 40 with the idea that we would be fast on approach and I wanted to be as slow as possible. I also thought that the decrease in approach speed would be commiserate with the difference in maximum flap speeds. I realize now that was incorrect and flaps 30 would have been more appropriate.The landing was uneventful. We taxied clear of the runway towards the emergency vehicles and stopped to allow them to check us. Coordination with ATC and fire service was seamless and expeditious. I made an announcement to the passengers that the service vehicles were quickly checking on us out of an abundance of caution. After they checked the engine and the brakes; the overheat light having never reilluminated; we elected taxi back to the gate. I kept both engines running because we were heavy; could shut the engine down at any time we got the light; and had emergency vehicles following us.After shutdown at the gate and parking checklist; I made another announcement apologizing for the inconvenience; and advised everybody to check their apps and talk with the Customer Service Representative regarding their amended travel plans. Me and the FO quickly debriefed but as soon as we opened the door maintenance were there and needed their debrief.Because I was busy as well I quickly wrote up the engine overheat and overweight landing without any detail because I assumed that I would have an extensive verbal debrief. As well it would have taken me a very long time to type out all the details on the ACARs. Maintenance expressed some displeasure with this.  If I had to do it over again I would have waited to type the writeups with maintenance beside me so the appropriate details would be in the original writeup.Chief Pilot's office support was great. We were met at the gate by the Chief Pilot's office representative. He put us at ease; helped us with a human factor survey; support and with our schedules; etc.Following all that I met the flight attendants in the back and had an extensive debrief. I had intermittently monitored their PA's and knew they had donea great job despite all the stress.As we were leaving the flight deck finally; the FO noticed that the engine overheat light had reilluminated with the engine shut down. I called maintenance to update that fact.I made an announcement to the passengers at the gate; called the Chief Pilot; and went to the Chief Pilot's office to further debrief with the  Chief Pilot's office representative.",,"I arrived at the aircraft right at our scheduled report time; following a gate change and aircraft swap. I boarded and immediately started pre-flight procedures. I was quickly interrupted by one of the flight attendants who asked if I could contact maintenance about an issue with their forward jumpseat. I made an entry through ACARS and contacted hub maintenance verbally. I then stepped out to do the walk-around. Upon my return to the cockpit I resumed pre-flight; and downloaded release 2 for the aircraft change. At this time I also read the maintenance release and noticed that fire detection loop B for ENG 1 was inoperative and deferred; and we were to operate on loop A. I was then interrupted again by another flight attendant informing me that 5 of the direct tv screens in the back were inoperative. I told her maintenance was already on the way and would take a look at those as well. Shortly thereafter the CA arrived. As we proceeded through our normal pre-flight procedures and brief; we were interrupted several more times by LEOs  (Law Enforcement Officers) boarding; the maintenance tech arriving; and another issue the flight attendants had identified (aft lav requiring service). When the maintenance tech arrived we went through the maintenance release write-up with him; confirming that it was in fact the B loop deferred. We confirmed this because when arriving at the aircraft the selector switch was in 'both'; not 'A' as it should have been. It then tested without issue.Once our new maintenance release was produced; we tried to get through our pilot brief. We were interrupted several times by the ground crew headset trying to connect without success. We also called ops several times to get confirmation of the aft lav service.We finally completed our brief and prepared to push; but ran into more issues with the ground crew headset. At one point I was given a hang signal asking if brakes were released despite the CA having verbally advised that we were not ready for brake release. These headset issues caused further delays with our push.We finally pushed back successfully and got taxi instructions to runway XYC; as the usual XX was closed. This caused brief departure delays due to our sequence. During this time the CA and I both remarked how that morning had several more interruptions and issues than usual. Although we managed them and identified the threat; they had caused some distraction. We mitigated with a slow taxi on both engines to regain control of pacing.Our takeoff and initial climb was uneventful. We were leveled off several times at low altitudes for traffic separation; and were given vectors. We eventually were given a higher climb and passed through 10;000 without issue. Shortly thereafter we noticed a master caution but without any illuminations on the recall panel. This led to a momentary delay as we searched for the cause of the master caution. We eventually identified the cause as a number 1 engine overheat light. We actioned the immediate action steps; called for and ran the QRC/QRH; and resultant reduced thrust on the left engine. The overheat light remained illuminated and we were discussing shutting the engine down when the light extinguished. We then ran the engine at idle thrust. We then [requested priority handling] and began a descent. The CA then gave me the controls to fly while he communicated with dispatch; the FAs; and passengers. I continued flying and started getting us vectors back to ZZZ. He also got landing data and began setting up for the approach back to XYL. During this time we discussed the plan to use the left engine for landing; and our plan if the overheat light came back on during the approach. The CA set brakes max; but we both agreed we had plenty of runway to stop the aircraft regardless. During this time our workload and stress levels increased and we became slightly task saturated and distracted with ATC communication; flight path management; briefing; andensuring we were not missing any steps. The landing data that the CA sent for returned an error; so we sent for it again. It came back with an error again; so he ran the non-normal landing distance and we reaffirmed that we had adequate stopping distance. At this point I transferred control of the aircraft back to the CA for him to fly the approach and landing. We intercepted the localizer and glide slope and proceeded with the approach. At this point the CA asked me to reference the overweight landing criteria to make sure we had not missed anything. It took me quite some time to find the correct section as there was no quick reference or supplementary procedure quick link. We abandoned the search as we were descending on final and decided landing the airplane safely with both our focus on flight path was more important. It was an oversight as we became task saturated.We landed safely and taxied clear of the runway before coming to a stop. We then contacted the fire marshals and asked them to check the left engine. They said they saw no abnormality so we decided to taxi in on both engines. We returned to the gate uneventfully and shut down. The CA made a PA apologizing for the inconvenience and explaining the situation and what could be expected next for follow-on passenger transport. We then began our debrief before being interrupted by maintenance. We discussed our experience with them; and subsequently with the  Chief Pilot's office representative who was waiting at the gate for us. He was extremely supportive and put us both at ease. We debriefed human factors with him; and then got up to leave the aircraft and head to the Chief Pilot's office. It was at this point that I noticed the overheat light had returned with both engines shut down. We confirmed that maintenance was not working on the aircraft yet; and called them to let them know. We then left and went to the Chief Pilot's office to continue our debrief and notify the Chief Pilot.",,"B737 flight crew reported the master caution and number one engine overheat lights illuminated during departure climb.

Refer to CA or FO report for more precise info. I had almost started to sleep as relief pilot on first break in the crew rest area; when my fellow Relief Pilot 'wakes' me; and tells me they shut down an engine. He had not yet finished getting ready in his bunk; and re-entered the cockpit before me. I quickly dressed and re-entered the cockpit; hooked up headset; etc. as the CA and FO started the fuel jettison non-normal checklist. They had already shutdown the right engine; etc.; before I re-entered the cockpit. I assisted by talking with Dispatch on SATCOM; relaying for crew. We decided not to pass over the suitable alternate of ZZZ. Dispatch provided ZZZ weather; and the previously requested landing data messages (LDM's). Because it took a while before the LDMs showed up on the printer; I referred to the 200B Non-normal landing distance table; calculating for ENG SHUTDOWN L; R (Flaps 20). I rounded up our actual gross weight to 480.0 to minimize extrapolation and derived a required landing distance of 4800 feet. My fellow Relief Pilot Q-C'd my calculation. We were happy I did the calculation; because Dispatch sent up LDMs only for flaps 30 and flaps 25. We compared my number to those from Dispatch for good measure and we agreed autobrakes 4 would be sufficient. (And they were.) I backed up the PF and PM; etc. and conferred with my fellow Relief Pilot as necessary. I also assisted communicating with the purser; updating our status and estimated landing time; etc. Our CRM seemed professional and effective to me and us as a crew. Our training kicked in very nicely. We backed each other up. The CA had set an open tone from the start of our flight brief and maintained it throughout the entire flight. He effectively managed time-critical tasks and delegated appropriately. As a crew we freely tested assumptions amongst each other. ATC; ZZZ tower; ground; all supported us in excellent fashion. Passengers thanked us for getting them to ZZZ safely.",,"The Relief Pilots had just left to start there break and we had leveled off at FL330. A few minutes had passed and we noticed a high oil temperature warning. Person 1 went to the checklist and started going through the steps. I had brought the thrust lever back slowly but the temperature keep getting hotter. Person 1 and I both looked at each other and decided we needed to land the plane at the nearest suitable airport ZZZ. Person 1 notified ATC we were [requesting priority handling] and going to ZZZ; I call the purser and told her we needed the Relief Pilot back up front and to prepare the cabin for a landing in ZZZ. We followed the checklist. We shut down the engine and started dumping fuel to get below landing weight. I believe it took between 25 and 30 minutes to get everything prepared before I made the landing in ZZZ. We told ATC to have emergency crews standing by. I made a single engine flaps 20 landing. It went smooth and we taxied to the end of the runway and then taxi to the holding area and ground crews had told us there was no fire just a little bit of smoke and a little fluid coming out of the right engine. There was no need to do an evacuation so we asked to passengers to remain seated until we could get things situated.  Coordinated with company to have buses come out to the aircraft and air stairs to deplane passengers which took probably 30 minutes.

I looked down for a diversion city and saw ZZZ at 160 miles; I advised FO lets go to ZZZ; he recommended ZZZ1 100 miles behind us; long runway; agreed with him and while I was flying with AP on; he [notified ATC] and asked to divert to ZZZ1; Center gave us a left turn and a descent.  While I made the turn and started the descend I advised the FO I have the airplane and the radio; and directed him to run the A sys hyd loss check list in QRH.  While descending I changed the destination in the FMC to ZZZ1 and went to ACARS and sent a dispatch message.As we got close to ZZZ1 and QRH was read and complied with; I advised FO the we will extend the gear on left downwind to Runway 18L just in case we run into issues for extending the Gear.  We extended the gear and everything worked normal; we received some residual fluid back and I believe the Qty went up; do not remember to what percentage.  we had 6 down and lock green lights; we had fire rescue standing by.  I landed on 18L smoothly and rolled off taxiways B and stopped for fire rescue to do visual inspection; they advised after landing there was no residue on the runway; with that said we taxied to gate B10 while fire and rescue followed.We parked then I heard from fire rescue on the frequency that there is a high press spray leak on the right wheel well; spraying fluid on number 3 tire creating a puddle.  Aircraft parked I went outside to see the leak and took videos for Maintenance Control and stated to communicate with Maintenance Control.  Asked FO to do a Electronic Log Book via ACARS.  Eventually fire rescue recommended to turn off the packs and the APU which we did.",,"While cruising along at FL410 the hydraulic master caution light came on. At this point I looked up at the over head panel to see the low pressure light on for the Engine (ENG) 1 hydraulic A pump. I pulled up the system pages and saw hydraulic system A was at 20% capacity. While I was monitoring the quantity; I saw it dropping; 19%; then 18%. The CA was using the restroom so I made a PA for him to come up when he can (we were an empty ferry flight). At this point I pulled out the low hydraulic pressure QRH and ran that procedure which only called for turning that pump off. After we turned off the ENG 1 hydraulic pump; the quantity was still dropping. At this point the CA and I knew we had a leak that we couldn't isolate and he'd eventually run out of fluid so we decided to divert to the nearest airport. We [requested priority handling] as it's a primary flight control system and we needed to get on the group ASAP before we lost all fluid. ZZZ was about 80 miles ahead of us but ZZZ1 which we just passed had a longer runway so we decided to go there instead. The CA coordinated with dispatch while I spoke with ATC about the divert. While enroute to ZZZ1; the CA and I reviewed the loss of hydraulic system A if it came to that. To our surprise we never lost hydraulic pressure in system A even though the quantity hit zero. Because we still had hydraulic pressure we never had to run the loss of system A so we used normal landing gear extension. However we did switch the nose wheel steering to the ALT mode just in case. Pressure dropped to about 2;000 PSI during gear extension but came back up after the gear were down and locked. We landed normally and had airport fire personnel inspection the plane and follow us to the gate. They reported a steam of fluid leaking from the right side of the plane near the main landing gear.",,"B737 flight crew reported a loss of Hydraulic System A pressure and fluid; resulting in a diversion to the nearest suitable airport.",

Very quickly; smoke started appearing in the cockpit through the ceiling vents.  I turned the autopilot and autothrottles off and pulled the #1 thrust lever to idle.  We donned our oxygen masks and [asked for assistance] and requested to land at ZZZ1.  The smoke dissipated within 3 minutes although we could still smell it in the air.  I talked to the flight attendants; and they echoed what we experienced with the smoke in the cockpit - it dissipated quickly.  I tried pushing the #1 thrust lever up slowly and started to experience the vibration again; so I pulled it back to idle and left it there.  We had just passed over ZZZ1 so we were very close to the airport - because of this; there was no need to do a drift down analysis.  Because; in my opinion; [I had] such a sharp First Officer; I felt the safest course of action was for [them] to continue running the checklists while I flew the airplane and talked to ATC. I felt it would have caused more confusion to transfer controls. We requested a descent and vectors so that we could run checklists and prepare for an approach and landing at the ZZZ1 airport. Once we got the aircraft stabilized in a descent; I called the flight attendants to get a situation report - they assured me everything was good in the cabin.  I made an announcement to the passengers that we would be diverting to ZZZ1.  I also sent a diversion message to dispatch.  I told the FAs that we would stop on the runway and that we would not be evacuating.  We ran the Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist followed by the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist.  The Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist is lengthy; but I could see no reason to rush through the checklist since the smoke had dissipated and there was no evidence of a need to rush through any parts of the checklist in order to land more quickly.  Rushing is always a threat to safety so I did not want myself or [the F/O] to feel rushed. I asked for the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist so that we could start cooling that engine down prior to landing - the oil temperature was higher than normal.  We set up for a Flaps 15; single engine approach to runway XXR in ZZZ1; briefed the approach; and requested vectors to join the final.  Once we were fully configured for landing; I turned the autopilot off.  When I did; the flight directors disappeared from both sides.  It was a clear VFR day; and I was stabilized with the VASI in sight; so I felt the safest course of action was to continue the approach and land without the flight director. It was a stable approach throughout.  We landed in ZZZ1 and stopped on the runway allowing CFR trucks to observe the outside of the aircraft.  When they gave us the 'all clear' we attempted to taxi to the gate.  Unfortunately; one of the brakes had locked up; so we requested a tow tractor to pull us into the gate.  All the passengers were seen by the fire rescue team and no injuries were reported to my knowledge.The causal factor was a problem with the #1 engine.  I don't know how this could have been avoided.",,"We were passing through approximately 30;000 feet when we heard a loud noise followed by feeling high vibrations from the number one engine. As well as abnormal engine indications on the number one engine; at this moment immediately the cockpit and cabin started filling with smoke with a strong odor. We donned our oxygen masks; The CA turned off the auto-throttles and autopilot and brought the number one engine to idle while we [requested assistance] with ATC; requesting to divert to ZZZ1 airport and performed an descent while checking on the cabin. The smoke started to dissipate within approximately 3 minutes but the strong odor was still present. We performed the fire; smoke and fumes checklist. Starting the descent procedure the CA talked to the flight attendants that told us the same occurred in the cabin as we experienced in the flight deck with the smoke quickly dissipating. We identify the smoke was being caused by abnormal indications; high vibrations from the number 1 engine. The CA and I made the decision to run the engine failure or shutdown checklist. We shut down the number one engine following the completion of the smoke; fire and fumes checklists. We landed on the runway and as we were rolling out Fire and Rescue team reported no fire or smoke from our engines or aircraft. We stopped on the runway so Fire and Rescue team can get a closer look at the number one engine. They gave us the "all clear" to taxi to the gate to let the passengers deplane at the gate for further investigation. Unfortunately when we tried to move under our own power the aircraft did not move and we identified we may have a locked up brake; maintenance team and tow came to tow us to the gate.

We completed the ECAM and FM (flight manual) procedures. The CA then attempted to contact data exchange and Maintenance Control via ARINC through a "call me" ACARS. The initial frequency we were given was very broken and unreadable for the most part. We were switched to another frequency and that seemed to work better; but then seemed to completely stop working after about 5 minutes. We sent data exchange an ACARS that we were planning to divert to ZZZ1 as it was the nearest suitable airport and we were having trouble with voice communication with them. I estimate we flew for at least 60 miles; probably more; while we were trying to sort out a suitable voice link to dispatch.

We discussed briefly to turn around; but the captain first would contact the company and coordinate the possible return to gate. As the airplane leveled off at FL 360; I made sure the airspeed stabilized well below the "red line" (max speed) and well above the "red line" (min speed) and verified  the N1 settings with the tables in the purser.

We jumped into the FM; and noted factors that can cause fluid displacement; and deduced that calling Maintenance Control would be prudent. Maintenance control told us to monitor the situation for 10-15 minutes; and that they would continue monitoring the frequency we were on with them. In that time; the Sys A fluid quantity continued to decrease from 78% to 71%; and after advising Maintenance control once again; they recommended a diversion to ZZZ1. We looked at all factors; and because there was a cold front producing a significant line of weather that we would have to deviate around going to ZZZ1; that ZZZ2 (Prior to the weather system) would be the safer alternative; as we communicated that if the quantity continues to drop; while deviating around some nasty weather; there is a potential for the situation to be much less safe. I noted the "Swiss cheese model" of contributing factors that had already been "lining up". Out of abundance of caution; we [requested priority handling] after communicating with dispatch.

At approximately 1500 feet the Captain noted to the crew; potentially conflicting aircraft traffic at approximately the 2 o'clock position. At about the same time; one of the Relief Pilots called out an overtemperature exceedance on the right engine. The Relief Pilot also noted that the right engine EPR had initially started to drop. The Captain then turned the autopilot on and slowly retarded the right engine throttle attempting to get the right engine EGT back below the temperature exceedance. At approximately the idle position the temperature remained below the temperature exceedance and back into the normal temperature operating range but at what appeared to be an elevated temperature for the idle position. At this point; the Captain elected to intercept the ZZZ XXX radial outbound per the engine failure procedure for Runway XXL even though the aircraft was at 1500 feet since the aircraft was climbing out very slowly and the Captain wanted to ensure terrain clearance while continuing to climb to 3000 and run checklists. The First Officer [requested priority handling] for the flight and told ATC the flight would be initially intercepting and proceeding outbound the ZZZ XXX radial while working the [situation].There were no EICAS messages or automatic Non-Normal Checklists displayed on the EICAS so the crew elected to perform the Engine Lim/Surge/Stall checklist on the right engine. As the First Officer performed the checklist; it was noted that the right engine temperature would increase abnormally higher as the right engine throttle was increased out of idle. As a result of the checklist; the crew decided to bring the throttle back to idle. The crew discussed the options for the right engine and decided to keep the right engine running in idle for the remainder of the flight unless absolutely needed. The crew reasoned this to be the most prudent action since the engine was still producing thrust; was at a stable but elevated temperature at idle (than normally expected) but still in the normal temperature operating range; was not operating erratically and did not appear to be damaged. Once the aircraft was stable and the Non-Normal Checklist was complete; the Captain directed the First Officer to request vectors from ATC to an area near the ZZZ airport that we could safely jettison fuel. While getting these vectors the Captain gave control of the aircraft to the First Officer so that the Captain could coordinate with dispatch; Maintenance Control and the flight attendant. The Captain asked the Relief Pilot to call the flight attendant and inform them of the current aircraft situation and that we would most likely be returning to ZZZ. Also; the Relief Pilot was instructed to make a PA announcement updating the passengers. In the meantime; the Captain was able to coordinate a discussion with dispatch and maintenance control. Maintenance Control noted that from his equipment sensors and readings of our aircraft that the exceedance was real and not a spurious indication. The crew discussed and was in agreement that the flight should return to ZZZ after jettisoning fuel. The Captain informed dispatch and Maintenance Control of the crew's decision to return to ZZZ and asked for any other recommendations for the engine issue; jettisoning fuel and coordination for the return to ZZZ. Maintenance Control gave no further guidance and noted the crew's intention to return to ZZZ and stated he would coordinate with Maintenance. Dispatch reminded the crew to annotate the time; location and fuel amount at the beginning and end of the fuel jettison process. Dispatch also indicated that he would calculate landing data for the return to ZZZ. Once the crew arrived at the ATC coordinated fuel jettison area the Captain initiated the Fuel Jettison checklist. The crew decided to jettison fuel down to the max landing weight so that the overweight checklist would not have to be run and a maintenance overweight inspection would not be required. The fuel jettison procedures for the amount of fuel onboard took approximately 30 minutes. During this time period the crew monitored the right engine for any changes and discussed and prepared the flightdeck for the descent; approach; landing; Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) coordination and return to the Gate. The crew anticipated a normal landing and decided that if there were no issue upon landing that they would coordinate to clear the runway and have ARFF inspect the right engine on the Taxiway for any issues prior to taxiing to the gate. Upon completion of the Fuel jettison checklist; the Captain briefed the crew for a single engine flaps 20 ILS approach to Runway XXR. Dispatch was having difficulties with the landing data so the Relief Pilot ran the landing data numbers for a single engine landing. The checklists were completed for descent/landing and the Captain flew the single engine approach to Runway XXR for an uneventful landing. Upon landing the Captain cleared the Runway and ARFF inspected the right engine; found no issues; so the flight continued to Gate. The passengers were then deboarded to the gate area and turned over to the gate agents. At the gate the crew debriefed maintenance concerning the right engine temperature exceedance. The crew noted to maintenance that the exceedance temperature was approximately 666 degrees celsius. Also; from the point the crew noticed the exceedance to the point the Captain promptly retarded the throttle to idle; the time duration was approximately one minute. The Captain then debriefed with the flight attendants and with the gate agents. The Captain and the flight crew then debriefed with Dispatch and the Chief Pilot through a telephone conference call. Finally; the flight crew debriefed their own performance.",,,,"Captain flying 777 aircraft reported EGT exceedance during takeoff climb. Flight crew returned and landed uneventfully.",

Shortly after liftoff; just after retracting the landing gear and with the autopilot still disengaged at around 200 feet AGL; we heard a loud banging noise. This was followed by a noticeable yaw to the left and a drop in the EPR of engine 1; from approximately 1.4 to 1.2. Within a few seconds; the EPR on engine 1 returned to normal on its own; matching engine 2. All other engine parameters remained stable; and no ECAM alerts were displayed.

It resembled a burning type smell; and we concluded we had most likely hit a large bird. We noticed at this time that we had partially lost power on the #1 engine; but that it had fully recovered after a few seconds and was showing normal indications. We continued the climb; and agreed that due to the strong nature of the yaw; the noise we heard; as well as the odor; that it made sense to return to ZZZ.

After verifying a positive rate of cabin climb and a positive Differential pressure; we concluded that the aircraft is pressurizing correctly. I pulled out my mask to have in handy in case of a sudden depressurization. The decision at the moment was to continue the flight.From my own past experience and due the abnormally loud noise (which could potentially cause fatigue if exposed to for a long period of time) I suggested it might be something else other than a seal and we agreed that once level at cruise I would get out of my seat and further investigate. Once leveled at 32;000 feet I transferred controls to the Captain and got up off my seat. I quickly noticed that the hissing sounds comes from the observer's mask; so I pulled it out to further check it; and the hissing sound stopped immediately.

It sounded as though it was on the First Officers side. I would compare it to someone holding down an air horn; like you'd find at a sports event. We both agreed immediately there must be some kind of air leak or faulty seal. We immediately requested a descent to 10;000. I told the First Officer his aircraft; his radios; tell them we want to return to ZZZ. I called the cabin who said they heard it as well; they thought it was an alarm going off; and was loud enough it could be heard significantly far back in the cabin. I explained though loud and unsettling; it was minor; we already where reaching an altitude where pressurization was no longer needed and due to the issue we would return to ZZZ for a precautionary landing; I'd call them back once we caught up. I made a calm similar pa to the passengers. I heard the First Officer at this time change frequency and the Controller asked if we were [requesting priority handling]; I told the First Officer that sounds good. I considered how it was difficult to communicate; and that we would be over weight when landing and could not logically think of any reason not to. I then called ZZZ ops and Maintenance and spoke to Maintenance; they asked if we could go to ZZZ2; i said no; it wasn't suitable; and said I was ok with ZZZ3 or ZZZ. The noise made communication difficult; thus I elected calling on the radio vs crew phone. I also sent an ACARS message and ACARS diversion report. The First Officer got us on a delay vector and down to 7000. ZZZ Maintenance called Maintenance Control and Operations Control I believe and told us ZZZ was ok but if I do get time call Operations Control to verify the best airport operationally. At this time we leveled at 7000 and the noise finally stopped. I told ZZZ that id call Operations Control. I called dispatch on the crew phone; they also requested ZZZ2; i told them unable; in which the dispatcher asked if I would go to ZZZ3. I said ZZZ3 was good; it has a longer runway than ZZZ anyway; and confirmed the company would prefer I go to ZZZ3 vs ZZZ; he confirmed and acar us the new information. We informed atc; we requested the longest suitable runway; which was XXL and was in use. We requested to have fire rescue meet us upon landing. We continued the delay vectors a few more times as we ran the non routine landing check list; and overweight landing check list. Followed by setting up and briefing the approach. We then ran the descent and before landing check list. During this I briefed the flight attendants again about the precautionary landing and made a calm reassuring brief pa to the passengers. I then took back the aircraft from the First Officer. We did the rnav XXL and we landed uneventfully on XXL; exited; followed the correct flow; passengers; inspection; and proceeded uneventfully to the Gate; in which maintenance met the aircraft.I believe our training worked very well and it felt like a good sim session.

The master caution alerted and after looking up I noticed the 'wing-body overheat' light illuminated.  I said 'my aircraft' and called for the wing-body overheat QRH procedure. Shortly after the light; the departure controller handed us off to center but after a short conversation with the captain; I took over the radio and communicated the captain's decision to return to ZZZ.  This malfunction had occurred the day prior on the same jet and the MX corrective action was to fix an actual problem and not just an indication. After completing the QRH procedure the light remained on and continued to remain on for at least the next ten minutes.  The captain decided to [request priority handling] and ask to be met by Crash Fire Rescue (CFR). We returned to ZZZ and was met by CFR. They scared the right side of the aircraft and found no anomalies.  We taxied to the gate and after opening the main cabin door the CFR personnel entered the cockpit and asked for the captain to sign some paperwork.  After the event and debriefing it ourselves we came to the shared conclusion that we were not fit to continue and reported fatigued. There has been a fatigue report filed by me about this event.Causal factors included: Task saturation and a high level of concern for the safety of the flight.",,"I started out the day with relatively good rest. I felt ready for Day 2.Aircraft X started out fairly normal except for write-up in Aircraft X's logbook about a right WING BODY OVERHEAT light that had occurred the day before.  I was concerned because the crew reported the light did not go out after running the QRH and maintenance had reported they found a loose clamp on right Air Cycle Machine (ACM) and it had been secured.  I was also curious if the crew had diverted for the issue and reviewed their flights but saw the flight had gone back and forth from ZZZ to ZZZ1.Ground ops were normal and we took off around XA:30 pm. Climbing through 11;000' we got a right WING BODY OVERHEAT.  The FO was flying and continued to fly while I got out the QRH and ran through the steps.  The jet showed the same indications as the day before- at the end of the checklist the light did not go out.  One of the frustrating things about this is that the QRH gives no further guidance.  Should we land 'As soon as possible'?  'As soon as conditions permit'?.  The lack of guidance caused a further workload because we had no official guidance to go by but our instincts/experience at this point. I would say we were relatively cool and professional during the whole event but I would characterize a bit of nervousness that we were both suppressing during the flight as we were in constant fear/uncertainty if this problem would escalate further and we would lose systems or a fire would start.  On one of my former aircraft a bleed air leak was a very serious malfunction that usually resulted in the plane catching on fire; loss of flight controls and eventual ejection from the jet.  This was a main contributor to the stress I was feeling.This all led to serious concern in the cockpit and I relayed to the FO that I was no longer comfortable taking the jet to ZZZ2 and that we would return to ZZZ3 because we had a jet that - for the second day in a row - had an unknown situation of very high heat escaping into its right wing area.  We [requested priority handling] and the FO flew jet back to ZZZ3 while I ran the necessary checklists of informing ATC/Company/Pax/FA's of our intentions and coordinating Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to be standing by for our landing.We landed uneventfully and ARFF looked us over; there was no abnormal heat indications so we had them follow us to the gate.  After we shut the engines down;  advised the passengers that they would need to deplane; ran through the shutdown checklist; did a walk-around and worked with maintenance to get the incident written up; and informed ops and dispatch of the status of the jet; I started to experience different symptoms of fatigue.   I was feeling a pit in my stomach - nauseous.  I was also feeling a little depressed - wondering if we had done the right things and irritated/frustrated that the QRH wasn't more detailed for our situation.   As I started to evaluate my Fitness for Duty to carry on with the rest of the flights of the day; I was concerned I didn't have the mental or physical capacity to go through another event like the one we just had.  That led me to believe that the stress we encountered from handling the situation itself; plus the stress of the underlying apprehension from not knowing if the malfunction would turn worse; caused me to be 'worn out' and not feeling like I wanted to fly anymore today; or better yet; should fly anymore today.  This realization of my current physiological state caused me to report 'fatigued'.1.  Perceived lack of guidance in checklist.  Add a step at end of WING BODY OVERHEAT checklist when the light does not go out to advise whether landing is recommended immediately or as soon as conditions permit.  This would alleviate stress from not knowing the severity of the malfunction and then worrying about making the correct decision of what to do next. 2.  No streamlined way to remove yourself from flying after a high-stress event like this.  Due to the stress of this situation; I did not realize what I was experiencing was fatigue.  Many phone calls to company/mentors were required to remove ourselves from flying when I no longer felt Fit for Duty.   Provide more education in the fatigue program that acute stress that occurs on flights with malfunctions such as this can cause fatigue. 3.  Not enough info in previous logbook write up for this condition.  Would have been nice to know what phase of flight they were in when it occurred; why they chose to continue to destination.  Any other items that occurred during the flight.  Increase emphasis to pilots to give a little more detail when writing up a more serious condition that would warrant more facts for perspective.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a Wing Body Overheat warning and returned to departure airport.",

We tried to rectify the issue by cycling the autopilot and hand flying but the issue remained. The CA (Captain) started a discussion with Maintenance Control and Dispatch to write up the issue. While we worked problem 1 problem 2 emerged. The number 2 brake temp sensor started to behave erratically and was giving us an intermittent hot brakes ECAM and was showing brake temps up to 900C; before the sensor displayed XX and stopped providing input.

Maintenance Control told us the smell reported by the FAs was consistent with hydraulic fluid getting into the air conditioning system. We all agreed continuing to ZZZZ1 was not an option. The Dispatcher; after conferring with the Company Communications System; told us a return to ZZZ was what they wanted. Since ZZZ had long runways and good weather and a proclivity for long; straight-in final approaches; it was already one of our choices for a diversion airport; along with ZZZ1; or possibly ZZZ2; so we agreed.We [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ center.

Then I made an announcement to the passengers and afterwards we began our turn back to ZZZ. Dispatch provided us with normal landing data for Runway XXC; XXR and YYC; and non-normal landing distance (7400ft). We said we would prefer Runway YYC as it was longer and not in use per the ATIS; so there would be no issues with traffic behind us.After discussing the hydraulic leak and the possibility of hydraulic fluid on the gear and the potential for a fire with hot brakes (an overweight landing was planned--center tank fuel was depleted; so dumping fuel was no longer an option) I told the Purser I wanted them to prep for an evacuation. I told her to tell the members of her crew first; and then to call me back when that was complete; so I could make an announcement to the passengers. However; she began making the required Preparation for Evacuation PA announcement before I could talk to the passengers myself. I interrupted her PA and explained that while I believed we would have a normal approach and landing; it was only with an abundance of caution I wanted this preparation to take place. Anticipating a possible loss of C Hydraulic Pressure; we reviewed the HYD SYS PRESS C (Only) checklist and went over possible scenarios of what might happen when we started configuring and what we would do if we got the low-pressure light at certain stages of configuration. (e.g. Go around and perform the HYD SYS PRESS checklist; which requires alternate flap and gear extension; continue to landing if we were at flaps 20 and gear down; etc.) Center Hydraulic Quantity had dropped to about .42 by this time.We told ATC to plan on us being on the runway for a while; anticipating the possible loss of Nosewheel Steering and to have ARFF standing by. Once level at 9000 feet; we depressurized the cabin as per the Evacuation Preparation checklist.We had flown direct to ZZZ the entire way from ZZZZ airspace in an effort to land with as much center hydraulic fluid as possible. ZZZ Center slowed us to 210 knots on a dog leg base to final for the ILS YYC. We turned on the C Hydraulic pumps as per the checklist's Deferred Items; to extend the flaps. At flaps 5; the fluid dropped to about .24. ATC slowed us to 170 and I (now the Pilot Flying) asked for flaps 20 on schedule. I dropped the gear around ZZZZZ.So; we were at flaps 20 and gear down; established on the ILS when the C HYD PRESS EICAS came on. We elected to remain at flaps 20 for the landing; to avoid possibly draining the rest of C Hydraulic fluid or complicating a possible go-around. HYD C fluid was at approximately .18 now.We landed overweight (#330;000) flaps 20. Landing was uneventful and we rolled out; stopping straight ahead. ARFF met the aircraft and reported some steam from the right main gear; but no fire. (Highest brake temp was 4.) We requested a tow to the gate; out of concern for a loss of Reserve Brake and Steering fluid and therefore Nosewheel Steering at an inopportune time. Maintenance met the aircraft and a tug was called. Maintenance had us run some checks of the brakes (I had to pump them on and off several times.) The tug left and then Maintenance said since we had brakes; we were to taxi to the gate. I told him we didn't have Nosewheel Steering. (Although we were aware we did have the below the standpipe hydraulic fluid; after reviewing the system earlier; and not knowing where the leak was; we decided not to risk relying on the Reserve Brake and Steering System; a possible failure of which would leave us with only Accumulator brakes.) Another tug showed up and we were brought to the gate.",,"Around one hour into the flight; while with ZZZZ center; the HYD QTY C EICAS message illuminated. At that point we accomplished the HYD QTY C non normal checklist. Upon completion of the checklist; which turns off the center pumps to isolate fluid; there was approximately 45% quantity in the center system. The checklist also referred us to the HYD PRESS C checklist to identify inoperative equipment with the system pumps off. Based on the effected equipment we selected from the right to the left autopilot. We also reviewed the HYD PRESS C checklist to identify contingencies in case system pressure was lost upon restoring the center pumps. At this point the Captain woke the Relief Pilot from break and then advised dispatch. We discussed whether a diversion was appropriate. Neither of us were comfortable with continuing; especially in the event that a diversion to an ETOPS alternate might be required with a compromised hydraulic system. We also preferred a diversion airport with long runways. ZZZ and ZZZ1 were discussed as our preferred airports with ZZZ2 as a third option. In consultation with dispatch and Maintenance Control the decision was made to return to ZZZ. An [priority handling] was also requested with ZZZZ Center.When the Relief Pilot returned to the flight deck he advised us that the flight attendants advised him of an acidic smell on takeoff. We suspected the smell was a result of the hydraulic leak. This led us to discuss the possibility of a potential fire scenario upon landing from fluid leaking on hot brakes. We also discussed possible contingencies in the event we were not able to fully configure the aircraft prior to losing center system quantity/pressure. It was decided to restore the pumps and configure the aircraft just prior to glideslope intercept at around 5000 to 7000 ft to give us time to level off and complete the HYD PRESS C checklist in the event it became necessary. We also made the decision to prep the cabin for evacuation as a precaution; in the event of fire; a loss of brakes/nosewheel steering; or landing in an unusual configuration. We also advised dispatch that we preferred to land on Runway YYC due to the longer length and desired crash fire rescue. It took approximately 90 minutes to return to ZZZ due to strong headwinds. This gave ample time to discuss contingencies and allowed the flight attendants plenty of time to prepare the cabin. After descending below 10;000 ft we finished the preparation for evacuation checklist and upon reaching 7000 ft we restored the C system pumps and began configuring the aircraft. We were able to configure to gear down and flaps 20 prior to losing pressure in the center hydraulic system. At this point the quantity was approximately 12%. We also received the SPOILERS EICAS message (as anticipated) and briefly reviewed the associated checklist. The approach was normal and stable; well flown by the Captain; and the landing uneventful. Given concerns over nose wheel steering the decision was made to stop straight ahead on the runway. Given concerns over low system quantity/pressure impacting nose wheel steering a tow in to the gate was called for. Crash fire rescue examined the landing gear area. There was some steam from hydraulic fluid on warm brakes; but no indication of fire or excessive temperatures. The aircraft was subsequently towed to the gate and the passengers deplaned to another waiting aircraft to resume their flight. We debriefed as a crew and then contacted the Chief Pilot per the FOM. At this point we were timed out and released from further duty. I generally thought we worked together as a crew; and the Captain did an excellent job managing the situation.",,"B767 flight crew reported low hydraulic fluid level in center system and suspected leak during cruise.

After work was completed and paperwork sorted; we taxied out and took off approximately one hour late.  On climb out approaching FL100; we noticed that the cabin pressure was having a hard time keeping up with the climb.  I decreased my climb rate to give the pressurization system time to catch up; and eventually leveled off at approximately FL120.  It was during this time that we got a Cabin Altitude warning horn. We immediately accomplished the CABIN ALTITUDE QRC Checklist; donning our O2 masks and coordinating a descent to FL80.  The warning horn ceased sometime during this descent.  After taking care of immediate items in the cockpit I contacted the lead Flight Attendant to ensure everyone was OK (they were) and asked if any PAX (Passenger) O2 masks had dropped.  They had not. We coordinated with ATC for a return to ZZZZ for an overweight landing.  We took care of all checklists and coordination in holding at ZZZZ1; then were vectored for an ILS XXR at ZZZZ. I (Captain) flew the approach and overweight landing.Fire trucks met us as we exited the runway.

We were in a MAX 9 aircraft that had a history of a low pressure on the hydraulic system B engine driven pump. I conferenced with Dispatch and Maintenance Control prior to the flight to make sure I understood that nothing was required of us on the verification flight other than the Electronic Logbook (ELB) report if everything passed. They concurred. The First Officer (FO) and I departed as planned and everything went normally up until the climb out . Upon climbing out around 15;000 ft.-20;000 ft.; we received a master caution. The right engine (SYS B) Hydraulic EDP had a low pressure light. The FO was flying; so I ran the QRH keeping in mind that there was a history of this. The QRH directed us to turn off the right side hydraulic engine driven pump. I pulled up the synoptic page while I was doing this step to ensure we retained pressure and fluid quantity. Pressure remained constant and the quantity rose to the max of 106% on the right hand side. I opted to conference Dispatch and Maintenance Control due to the history of it and bring them in the loop. We all agreed that continuing to ZZZ1 was appropriate due to the electric pump picking up the slack. Around 10 minutes later; we step climbed to FL340 as planned. After leveling off at FL340; I allowed the passengers to get up. A few minutes later; we received a flashing right (#2) engine 'oil filter bypass' light. Knowing the possible outcome of this checklist; I gave the radios to the FO and warned that this may lead to a descent/inflight shutdown. I began running the QRH for oil filter bypass; and we realized we were going to need to descend due to the need to reduce the power to the #2 engine. I turned on the seatbelt sign and had the flight attendants take their jumpseats. We were on ZZZ Center; I tried to get their attention for a descent. He was busy with another call so I [advised ATC]. He responded immediately and I asked for a descent. He gave us a descent to FL240 and advised to let him know if we needed anything else. Complying with the QRH; we reduced power to the engine and the oil filter bypass light extinguished. According to the QRH; as long as it remained extinguished and didn't re-appear; we didn't need to run the INFLIGHT ENGINE SHUTDOWN QRH. We knew we were going to be diverting at this point. Around the time I announced that the oil filter bypass QRH was complete; we received more master cautions; this time; the once working system B electric pump. I checked the HYD synoptic and noticed that hydraulic system B had dropped to 0 for quantity and pressure. The FEEL DIFF PRESS; FLT CONTROL SYS B; and associated pump light were illuminated. I ran the QRH for all lights; which included putting the FLT CNTRL SYS B into STBY RUDDER; turning off the associated pump (ELEC 1 on SYS B) and preparing to run the LOSS OF SYS B (MAX) QRH. We [requested priority handling]; and the FO started pulling weather for ZZZ2 and ZZZ3. I conferenced Dispatch and Maintenance Control once again. I advised what had happened and that we were a [priority] aircraft at this point. Looking at alternates; we kept in mind that we were not a 'land at nearest airport'; although we recognized the severity of the situation. Maintenance Control advised that ZZZ3 was best for them; however; the FO and I saw lower ceilings; icing conditions; and wet runways at ZZZ3 and similar at ZZZ2. We had 35000lbs of gas and still needed time to run checklists and brief the flight attendants (FAs). Keeping in mind that we were going to have to alternately extend to flaps 15; loss of certain flight controls/primary braking system; wet runways; and land VREF 15 ICE speeds into ZZZ3. We ultimately agreed that the safest course would be to go to ZZZ4 where there was longer; dry runways; no ice; and more services. It also gave us more time to setup and brief. We finished thedeferred checklists from the LOSS OF SYS B checklist. Slowed below 230 kts. and configured using the alternate extension system early; and eventually swapped controls for the landing. Upon landing; we exited the runway and awaited Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspection. I informed ARFF what had happened asked them to inspect the aircraft for any leaking fluid and/or abnormal conditions. After a moment; the ARFF Operator came on and said he didn't notice any fluid but saw a larger amount of smoke coming from the #2 engine. I advised that it may be due to the hydraulic fluid being dumped into that engine; and it may the source of the smoke. He advised that with the amount of smoke coming from the #2 engine; that he wanted to be safe and advised us that they would be spraying the engine to ensure that the risk of fire was mitigated. Not being able to see it for ourselves; we opted for the safest course of action which was to shut down the #2 engine and follow his recommendations; especially given that he has a much better picture of what's happening down there than we do without being able to see it at the time. They sprayed the engine and confirmed the source of smoke was eliminated. We started the APU and shut down engine #1; ran the supplemental tow-in checklist; and got towed back to the gate. Upon arrival I debriefed with the Chief Pilot; Maintenance Control; Dispatch; and local Maintenance.",,,,"B737 MAX 9 flight crew reported hydraulic system malfunction and oil filter bypass issue during cruise.

It was the Captain's leg and he briefed that there was roughly 1;000 lbs of fuel in the center tank which may trigger a master caution light on takeoff. He requested that I remind him to turn the center pumps off prior to taking the runway. N1 target was 83.6% per the performance data; the engine instruments were displayed on the right navigation display (it was a Max); and the secondary engine indications were de-cluttered post-engine start. On takeoff; the master caution illuminated at 130 kts. and I called out that it was the center fuel tanks. As we were retracting the gear I smelled something burning and thought that it was one of the ovens in the forward galley. At roughly 400 feet the flight attendants initiated a triple chime and notified us that they smelled something burning. I looked down at the engine fire panel and saw the overheat light was illuminated and then saw that the #1 engine EGT gauge was very high however the digital read-out of the EGT did not have a red box around it indicating an EGT limit exceedance. I notified the Captain that there was an engine overheat and we were simultaneously switched to ZZZ Departure. Passing 4;000 ft. the master warning light; engine fire light; and the engine fire bell indications occurred. We [requested priority handling] and requested a level off at 5;000 ft. with vectors to Runway XXR. ATC amended the vectors for a visual approach to Runway XX. Both engines were providing full thrust; so the engine out (EO) SID did not arm. The Captain continued to fly the aircraft while I executed the QRC and QRH. While running the QRH the Captain directed me to take the aircraft and radios while he continued to run the checklists. We received a descent to 4;000 ft. then a follow-on descent to 3;000 ft. I called for flaps 1 and flaps 5 and loaded ILS XX into the CDU (Control Display Panel) to back up the visual approach. We reported the field in sight and were cleared for the visual Runway XX. I called for gear down; flaps 15; we configured; and the Captain took the landing. The non-normal and normal checklists were complete and we landed below max landing weight without further event. We stopped on the runway; I set flaps 40 and the Captain retracted the speed brakes; and the fire department inspected the #1 engine and brakes while the Captain made a PA to the passengers. The fire department reported no abnormalities and notified us that we were safe to taxi to the gate. We coordinated with operations and ATC to taxi back to Gate XX with the fire department following us. Once shut down the passengers disembarked without event. There was no apparent damage to the #1 engine and there was no red box around the digital EGT display. I believe the causal factor was some type of mechanical failure in the #1 engine. I do not know the nature of the engine malfunction and cannot make meaningful recommendations to mitigate future risk.On debriefing the event we saw that there was an EGT split once TOGA was selected; with the left side reading 999 and the right side reading 827. I was focused on the N1 gauges to ensure that the proper thrust setting was achieved and then shifted my focus to the Primary Flight Display (PFD) to monitor the takeoff and make the appropriate pilot monitoring (PM) callouts. The digital EGT gauge did not illuminate red indicating an over-temperature condition so I did not realize the #1 engine was running hot. I believe I misdiagnosed the master caution at 130 kts. due to a combination of expectation bias and difficulty seeing the overheat light from the right seat (it is partially masked by the #1 engine fire handle) during a critical phase of flight. Had I noticed the over-temperature while still on the runway I do not believe we would have initiated a rejected takeoff as we were in the high-speed rejection regime with little time remaining. Having an EICAS would have likely prevented themisdiagnosis however I do not believe it is not likely to be changed on the 737. From now on I will include EGT in my scan as pilot monitoring (PM) when takeoff thrust is set. I do not believe this was a causal factor but it is my main lesson learned from the event.",,"Pushed back from Gate XX in ZZZ and started engines as normal. Taxied to the departure Runway XXL. On taxi out I informed the First Officer (FO) that we may get a master caution with 1000lbs in the center tanks and that we would assess that as we approached the runway as to weather we would go with center fuel pumps closed for takeoff. On takeoff roll we got a master caution light at about 130 kts.; as we briefed continuing in that event; as we did. Initially it was called out as a fuel issue until airborne; after takeoff got a triple chime from the flight attendants (FAs) about smelling burning smell and further assessment and inspection that the caution light was an engine overheat on eng#1 shortly there after we got the left engine fire warning. We then [requested priority handling] with ATC; performed the engine fire QRC and corresponding QRH; notified the Dispatcher/FAs/PAX (Passengers) that we would return for landing back in ZZZ. A "normal" landing was made. After stopping on Runway XX; Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspected our aircraft and deemed it safe to taxi to the terminal. Max landing weight was not exceeded as we took-off below max landing weight.Cautioning about the potential caution light about fuel may have set us up for "seeing what we wanted to see" instead of what it actually was. However that wouldn't have changed our decision to continue in this case. Intersting to note that the engine "red" digits did not illuminate. Also as I was the flying pilot the engine instruments were set to the FOs side for monitoring; however I don't know that I would've noticed a difference because the temps were high but not "red" at anytime. Normally if the engine temps have been exceeded after shut down the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) indicator would show A red box where the digits would be; there was none.

Passing 5000 I witnessed the right engine oil qty plummet to 2 qts then bounce between1 - 3 qts.  The white title on the engine system page started flashing and the quantity periodically showed amber xx's but hovered around 1 qt.  We coordinated with ATC to halt the climb at 6000 ft and to put us in a box pattern so we didn't get too far from the airport in the event engine 2 failed.  We coordinated with dispatch on a precautionary return to ZZZ as opposed to continuing 3 hrs to ZZZ1 with the continued indications on Engine 2 and the uncertainty of the oil status. [Priority handling was requested]; ATC was given the necessary information and we prepared the aircraft to return to ZZZ for a landing on runway XYL.  The FAs were given all the appropriate briefing information and then passengers were briefed accordingly.  As we had no ECAM procedure to follow and there is no QRH procedure for the situation and the engine oil temp was not showing an overheat and had pressure plus still generating thrust we elected to leave it running until instructed to shut it down - engine 2.  Additionally as we were slightly over the max landing weight we performed the 'Landing Overweight' QRH checklist.  Dispatch provided us with the necessary landing data and we proceeded to land uneventfully on runway XYL the taxied to gate XX without any further incident.  Upon arriving at the gate we conferred with Maintenance and entered the appropriate electronic logbook report.

The oil quantity gauge continued to fluctuate between 0-11 quarts of oil with the remaining indicators showing normal ranges. Uncertain of whether the indicator was accurate or not; we decided the safest course of action was to return to the field in the event the engine failed. I continued to fly the aircraft while the captain coordinated with dispatch and our flight attendants. Once all completing our descent and overweight landing checklists; and ensuring all steps had been completed; we returned to the field and conducted a normal visual approach to XYL for an overweight landing.

Specifically; as we configured with flaps; the max maneuver/min maneuver speed bands converged with corresponding max/stall speed bars also converging on both Primary Flight Displays (PFDs). No 'IAS DISAGREE' msg; however I was unable to engage VNAV when cleared and as the bands converged it became apparent that we had a problem. I disconnected autopilot and around 2600' initiated a soft go around. As I was concerned with our stall margin; I did not change configuration until I was safely in climb with speed increasing. Our airspeeds were in sync with each other and the groundspeed so at that point I then performed full go around maneuver. We [requested priority handling] and once above the clouds I directed FO to the airspeed unreliable checklist. I suspected that icing was the culprit and as the FO ran the checklist we concurred that our airspeeds were accurate and it was likely an indication problem with our speed warning systems due to the icing. Both of our alternates had been reported as overcast (OVC); so we decided to reattempt an approach to ZZZ and requested vectors again for the ILS XXL. This time; I disengaged both the autothrottle/autopilot for the approach and asked the FO to monitor all airspeeds and call out anything less than 160kts(vref was 148). I flew the approach maintaining a higher than normal speed to stay above the min maneuver band. Since the Airspeed (AS) unreliable checklist didn't exactly reflect our situation; I decided that during the approach any stall warning indications would be respected. At some point during the approach we got the 'Leading Edge (LE) FLAPS TRANSIT' light on. As far as I know; we never exceeded any flap speeds or aircraft limits during the event. We landed; left the flaps down and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting inspect the aircraft; particularly our flight controls because we still had transit light. Everything appeared normal and we proceeded to our gate. Postflight inspection revealed some rime ice on the Leading Edge Devices (LEDs) and Maintenance discovered icing in the slat tracks. Cause: Icing. We had covered it in our brief and selected engine anti-ice but I never considered turning on the wing anti-ice and in retrospect realize that it may have mitigated some of our issues. Wing anti-ice is used so rarely that I tend to focus on the restrictions/limitations over the reasons to use it. Not anymore!                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Time. After [requesting priority handling] I felt time constrained because in the back of my mind I was concerned about our plan B. I knew the ceiling/vis should not be a problem getting into ZZZ; but was not sure how far we might need to go if we couldn't safely get below the OVC layer and needed an alternate with no ice on the arrival. In the rush to get back into the approach I did not give the Flight Attendants (FAs) a precautionary landing brief. I also opted to continue the approach with the transit light on because we knew it was icing related and that would take several minutes of checklist.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Checklist. The airspeed unreliable checklist was our initial response to the indications; however the checklist does not consider an event that presents initially as unreliable airspeed but then once checklist is completed we still encounter PFD speed warnings anomalies. I would recommend a decision tree that considers if all airspeed indications are accurate; that icing accumulation may be a factor and direct accordingly with winganti-ice and speed additives for approach.",,,,"A B737-800 pilot reported unreliable airspeed indications due to icing during initial approach.

I noticed the odor was like a plastic/rubber smell but it went away as the pilots started the engines. We performed the safety demonstration and when I came back I noticed the smell. As we sat down for takeoff my FA #4 asked if she could turn off the coffee pot warmers and I told her "yes." At that point I figured the smell came from the coffee pot warmers as sometimes coffee spills on that metal hot plate. As we were getting ready for the service I noticed the smell but since we had turned on the warmers and started brewing the coffee didn't think too much of it. We did the service and noticed it as we got back to the galley. After we picked up the trash I sat down and ate. After like 5 minutes my FA #4 comes to me and asks if I can smell a rubbery/plastic smell. I told her I did and at that point it was stronger. She went up and told the FA #1 so at that point FA #1 came to the back to assess. She smelled it 3 to 4 rows from the back galley; it got stronger as she went into the back galley; and she saw a haze in the galley. At that point she informed the Captain and he advised us to turn everything off and wait 10 minutes to see if the odor subsided and to keep him informed.At that point I became used to the odor and could not smell it anymore but my FA #1 was still smelling it. The FA #3 came to the back and she noticed the odor 3 to 4 rows from the back galley as well. At this point the Captain decided we were going to make a rapid descent and do a [priority handling] landing into ZZZ with emergency vehicles meeting the aircraft as a precaution he did not want to take any chances in case there was something else going on that we could not see. We made the [priority handling] landing; ZZZ emergency vehicles assessed the aircraft using heat detection equipment; and they proceeded to follow us to the terminal. The odor did dissipate as we got on the ground. About 45 minutes before landing I started to get a headache rating a 6 from a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being mild and 10 being severe); very dry eyes; and exhausted/tired feeling. The Captain told us this was going to be written as a fume/odor event; Maintenance came and talked to each one of us; then a ZZZ Manager talked to us. He asked how we're feeling - 3 of us had headaches; red eyes; and exhaustion. He advised us we could go straight to our layover hotel or we can go to the hospital to get blood work done for carbon monoxide poisoning. When we decided we were going to the hospital to get tested whoever he was talking to on the other side was not happy with the response we gave him it almost seems like they were disregarding the entire fume event. We proceeded to the hospital via rideshare after being on the phone for 30 minutes just to file a report and start the process.Fume events NEED to be handled differently and faster. This whole calling to file a report to talk to a nurse to assess AND then we choose whether or not we want to go to the hospital based on nurse recommendations should NOT be handled like this! So much time wasted ESPECIALLY when we have a 4-hour window to get blood drawn! There needs to be a faster way to get this done. Furthermore the attitudes from managers is NOT appreciated especially when we tell them what our symptoms are! In addition; having to call out sick; then file a report; and then get it recategorized should not be the case; it almost seems like we are getting penalized for even reporting a fume event. The fact that if we had worse symptoms; having to worry if we would be pay protected for the trip since we were working and having to a get "sick" before we file to get it recategorized SHOULD NOT have to be this way at all; the airlines' priority should be for us not to worry about that and make a seamless process.

The Captain served as the flying pilot; while the First Officer acted as the monitoring pilot. Upon climbing through Flight Level 330; I noticed the cabin altitude flashing; indicating a pressure altitude of approximately 9;200 feet. We initially requested to level off but then opted for a descent to 31;000 feet. As cabin pressure continued to rise; we informed ATC of a cabin pressurization issue and requested a lower altitude to resolve the problem. We were assigned Flight Level 270; at which point I donned my oxygen mask and called for the Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) for high cabin pressure; specifically CAB PR EXCESSIVE CABIN ALT.During our descent to 270; we received an ECAM notification for excessive cabin altitude. We completed the memory items; and I called for the Emergency Descent QRC. We requested a descent and were initially cleared to Flight Level 200. As we descended; I asked the First Officer for the nearest airport. He mentioned ZZZ1 and ZZZ. I decided to divert to ZZZ and asked him to coordinate the change in destination and request a lower altitude. We were subsequently assigned 17;000 feet.As we descended to 17;000 feet; cabin pressure began to recover and normalize. We informed ATC that our cabin pressure was normal and requested to maintain 17;000 feet. We were approximately 180 miles from ZZZ. We completed the QRC and QRH procedures for the non-normal situation as outlined in QRH. We determined that an overweight landing was unnecessary and then swapped control of the aircraft.I first called the inflight crew to update them on our situation; instructing them to discontinue service and prepare the cabin for landing in about 20 minutes. I then contacted our dispatcher via satellite phone to report the pressurization issue and our diversion to ZZZ. While on the call; she connected me with our maintenance controller; and I briefed them on our situation and intentions. The approach and landing were uneventful.

The captain continued to fly the aircraft while I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ departure; requesting a level off at 10;000 feet and a heading; with an intent to return to ZZZ airport; and requested them to stand by while we figured out the issue and ran some checklists. Over the next few minutes; the #2 ENG REV indication did go away which then was accompanied by an increase in thrust to what was being commanded by the position of the #2 throttle; I believe. Once the #2 ENG spooled up; the #2 ENG REV indication re-illuminated; and accompanying loss of thrust on the #2 ENG. The cycle repeated itself maybe 2 or 3 times. There was a noticeable yaw in the aircraft but was controlled the captain flying. While this was going on I opened the electronic QRH in Comply; I did make a mistake opened the REVERSER 7.XX checklist; but quickly noticed my mistake as that was for ground operations; and then opened the correct REV 7.XY checklist. The captain continued to fly while I read the checklist. This then led us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist. It was around this time we began a decent to 8000 feet I believe. I then ran the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist which we completed for the #2 ENG. Once completed; I then ran the One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist; referencing how much landing distance would be required at which point I noted that it would additionally be an overweight landing. Once these were completed prior to the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist being completed; the captain and I swapped pilot flying duties vs pilot monitoring duties. The captain then notified dispatch of the issue; the flight attendants and the passengers on the situation and that we would be returning to ZZZ. During this time; I also began set up and reviewing for an approach to ILS XXC back into ZZZ. It was around this time I stated to ATC; Fuel on board; Passengers on board and the nature of the [situation] as well as stating we could begin our arrival into ZZZ. ATC gave us headings to complete a 360 degree turn prior joining XXC LOC.  It was around this time to the best of my recollection that the captain requested the aircraft back; and we swapped pilot flying vs pilot monitoring duties. I then ran the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist; as well as the Overweight Landing checklist. Once completed; we reviewed the approach plate for ILS XXC into ZZZ; as well as running the Before Landing Checklist. It was around this time we intercepted the XXC course for landing and began our approach. Once closer to the runway; I noticed ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting] and emergency response vehicles parked on the adjacent taxiways to XXC which then followed our aircraft after exiting the runway taxiway 1 off XXC. Once stopped; the captain requested the passengers remain seated while I communicated to ARFF command; requesting an inspection of the #2 ENG for any abnormalities. Once; the inspection was completed and they stated they didn't see any abnormalities; we cancelled out [priority handling] status. I then coordinated with ZZZ Company operations for an arrival gate of XX. The captain then began to taxi the aircraft towards XX with ZZZ ground instructions while I called the flights attendants and confirmed everyone was ok and that we would be going to Gate XX. Once; at the gate we completed the shutdown checklist. The captain made a logbook entry for the incident. He then spoke to the director. At which point we then booked tickets on the next ZZZ-ZZZ1 flight home as we had already gone over our over time for the day. This statement is the best recollection I have of the events as they happened for Aircraft X. I do believe the crew; as a whole; did an amazing job and I was fortunate to have completed my annual recurrent training recently; which made me feel that I had recency in dealing with [a situation] of this type. I do believe my Company has a great training program with knowledgeable individuals coming together to train us for when a situation like this arises.  No recommendations. Company has a great training program.",,,,"B737-800 First Officer reported engine failure with FADEC and reverser lockout malfunction resulted in an expeditious return to departure airport to an overweight landing.",

The aft temp display in the cockpit showed the temperature dropping; but the flight attendants kept telling us that the temperature in back hadn't dropped at all. The Captain had looked through our manuals but found no set procedure for such an incident.On our descent into ZZZ; perhaps near ZZZZZ intersection on the ZZZZZ1X arrival (possibly closer to the airport as we were getting handed off to ZZZ Approach); the Flight Attendant (FA) called to tell us that a woman was overheating and requested EMTs at the gate. There were no medical professionals onboard. The Captain turned off the Hot Air switch and the plane began to cool down a bit. We then [requested priority handling] and were given Runway XXR and an expedited taxi to the gate. The lady walked off under her own power and the EMTs took it from there.
