The First Officer and I were the only people onboard. The aircraft had spent 3 days in Maintenance for a previous gear extension write up.Upon arrival; when we attempted to extend the landing gear down; the only indication we received was three red gear unlocked indications. We retracted the gear handle and the indications went back to lights out normal retraction. We attempted to extend the gear again and got same indication. No ECAM warning was present. I selected the wheel page to verify the gear was not down and locked. We performed a go-around and got vectors while we worked the issue.We ran the Landing Gear (L/G) not down locked QRH procedure; which lead us to the L/G gravity extension checklist. The checklist was successful. We received 3 green down-locked gear indications. We returned for an ILS. I requested that Crash Fire Rescue be standing by. I also notified ATC as a precaution; but advised ATC we did not require any special assistance. I also advised tower that once we landed; it was possible we would not be able to clear the runway since the QRH procedure disables normal nose wheel steering. The landing was normal and uneventful and I was able to clear runway. We cleared the runway and stopped the aircraft. We advised company and maintenance that we would need to have the aircraft towed to a gate due to lack of nose wheel steering. A company tow vehicle repositioned us to the gate.,A319 Captain reported malfunctioning landing gear; which required going through QRH procedures to get three green. Flight landed normally; but without nose gear steering.

We also smelled it but it was not too strong. The Flight Attendant walked through the whole cabin and called us back to report that the odor was in the whole cabin. I put the pack flow to high to try to increase airflow and ventilation in the cabin. That seemed to help reduce the strength of the odor but it was still present. Upon descent the strength of the odor seemed to increase again. The smell was still present but not very strong upon gate arrival. The Flight Attendants complained of a metallic taste in their throats and excessive thirst. I also noticed being thirsty. The whole crew decided to remove ourselves from duty and go to the on premise medical facility for evaluation. The First Officer and I felt fine and were cleared for duty. We then flew our next segment. The Flight Attendants still had the symptoms and one said that she was feeling dizzy so they did not return for duty.,A319 Captain reported the Flight Attendants were not feeling well after being exposed to odors in the cabin.

I was the pilot monitoring. Handling the coordination of paramedics/dispatch/medical personnel (onboard the aircraft) we were advised by the doctor/nurse on board that our passenger's medical situation was declining. At that time we requesting special/expedited handling. ATC NY approach did a great job prioritizing us. While the workload was high; the Captain included our pilot jump seater in assisting me as the pilot monitoring. All was safely accomplished. The medical situation was coordinated and being handled by flight attendants/medical personnel in the cabin and Dispatch had notified for paramedics to meet us upon arrival. The Captain and I were both doing our normal duties. He was flying. I was pilot monitoring. Communicating with the flight attendants and Dispatch had concluded. While on the arrival receiving radar vectors we were at 5;500 descending. ATC notified us that we had VFR traffic that they were not in contact with 1000 below us. We saw him in the TCAS and watched him maneuver closer to us when we got a TCAS RA. I believe the Captain even saw the traffic visually.  The autopilot was on at the time. I turned off the flight directors as per our procedure. The Captain clicked off the autopilot and followed the TCAS RA. It was a Climb RA; followed by a Monitor Vertical Speed; then a Clear of Conflict. We advised ATC of the TCAS RA to which they responded they watched us respond to it. We came within 400 ft of the traffic. The Captain once clear of conflict continued to hand fly the arrival and approach with autopilot and autothrottles off. We landed safely. Paramedics met the aircraft at the gate upon arrival and received medical attention. The Captain and I along with the help of jump seaters and Dispatch as well as flight attendant and medical personnel on board handled the situation safely and although we had multiple threats we were able to navigate safely to a safe landing. All personnel handled it very professionally.,A320 First Officer reported an NMAC on arrival into EWR with a light aircraft that was not in contact with ATC.

On this SID the POM VOR is to be crossed at or below 8;000 feet. Clearance was to climb via the SID except maintain 14;000. SoCal advised us of VFR traffic less than a mile north of the POM VOR at 6;500. Shortly before reaching the POM VOR on the SID; SoCal told us to amend altitude to maintain 6;000. We then stopped the climb and leveled at 6;000. Shortly after leveling and approaching the POM VOR and making the turn on the SID towards terrain; we received an RA to descend due to the VFR traffic over the POM VOR; which had us descending towards terrain.Instead of SoCal flying us directly into traffic over the POM VOR; SoCal should have provided us with a heading to give us terrain and traffic avoidance. [They] gave us neither. If it is a necessity the VFR aircraft operate over the POM VOR; since the SID is at or below 8;000; the VFR traffic needs to be at or above 9;000. At the very minimum at or above 8;500 to provide separation. 6;500 is the same altitude we will be climbing through to climb via the SID.,A319 pilot reported airborne conflict (RA) with VFR traffic during SID climb.

At first I did not notice anything. Then a minute later I commented on a musty smell. It did not seem significant at that time; then the First Officer commented that she thought it was getting worse. I could now smell what she did; kind of like a light maintenance oily garage smell. At about 9;000 ft I called the cabin and asked if there were any odors or fumes in the cabin. The answer was negative. There were no vapors or smoke and aircraft systems indicated everything normal. I did not realize that the fumes were concentrated at the First Officer position on the Flight Deck. With only about 10 minutes to landing and on an intercept to Localizer I elected to focus on the approach and landing. At this point I still did not think the event was significant. After landing during taxi to the gate the fumes were noticeably stronger and the First Officer requested to open her window for some fresh air. Maintenance was called out and after doing the parking checklist I debriefed the mechanic and filled out the [maintenance log]. At this time I started to notice an oily taste in my mouth. Departing the jet bridge the First Officer commented that she did not feel right and we decided to call [my union] for guidance. While filling out the Smoke; Odor; and Fumes Report form I began to have symptoms similar to the First Officer. The oily taste; nasal and throat irritation along with a slight headache. We decided to call off the trip and seek medical for a checkup. [Operations Control] along with the [Maintenance Control] were notified. We were seen at the Urgent Care [in the airport]. We both had elevated blood pressure and elevated levels of Carbon Monoxide. Chest X-rays were taken. After treatment of 30 minutes on Oxygen another Blood Draw was accomplished and CO (Carbon Monoxide) levels had come down. We were released and deadheaded home. [Operations Control]; tracking/scheduling; Chief Pilot were notified. I checked the Aircraft Maintenance Log this morning. It looked like it turned out to be an Electronic Equipment Cooling Fan failure.,B737-800 flight crew reported smelling odors in the cockpit during the descent. Upon landing the crew was found to have elevated levels of carbon monoxide in their blood.

After acquiring the traffic; we called visual. As we continued our southbound climb; we noticed the traffic start a turn into us. We received a TCAS Traffic & Resolution Advisory to descend. We complied and I communicated this to ATC. The DC-3 passed above and behind us.When ATC made the call on traffic to us; we were able to acquire it visually. I'm not sure why ATC stopped giving us advisories unless the radar sweep was slow and he was not able to see the traffic turn into us. The TCAS (great tool) provided us backup to what we both could already see was about to happen if we did not intervene our flightpath. Later via a phone conversation with the Captain; the ATC supervisor said the Controller thought we were responsible for separation because we called traffic in sight.If in doubt; communicate early with ATC about your intentions or clarify your concerns about who is responsible for separation. When all else fails; rely on your training (back to the basics)...TCAS TA/RA procedures; traffic avoidance; etc. Also; this is a good reminder for us all in the cockpit of how important visual lookout is in all environments and the techniques we have (automation/autopilot) that allow us to maintain situational awareness while we look for potential threats.,A319 First Officer reported an airborne conflict during the climb out after reporting traffic in sight to ATC.
1512779,201801,,FO,Air Carrier,Passenger,B767 Undifferentiated or Other Model,Cruise,,Pilot Not Flying; Captain,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Smoke / Fire / Fumes / Odor; Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Illness / Injury,Person Flight Attendant,In-flight,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Flight Crew Returned To Departure Airport; Flight Crew Landed As Precaution; General Physical Injury / Incapacitation,Aircraft,Aircraft,Approximately 2 hours into the flight; I was contacted by our purser. She asked me if we were doing any turns or climbs or descents because she and a few other flight attendants were feeling dizzy and nauseous. I told her no; we had been in straight and level flight for the last two hours. I told her I'll try to increase the air quality in the cabin; so I turned off the Right Recirculating Fan. I also asked her if she or any of the other flight attendants smelled anything strange; like wet dirty socks. We also checked the cabin altitude to make sure that the cabin was not climbing. It was stable at around 8500 ft; and made sure there were no Ozone areas in the [weather] map. A few minutes later; [the Flight Attendant] contacted me again to let me know the flight attendants were getting worse; both the ones in the front of the airplane and in the back. That they were almost incapacitated. I asked her to wake up our IRO (International Relief Officer); and immediately contacted Dispatch through SATCOM and requested a patch with Medlink.[The First Officer] went through the entire cabin and could not smell any fumes or anything unusual. But he did say some flight attendants looked ill. One of them reported blurred; narrow vision; another had teary eyes and was sweating. I had the Purser come to the cockpit to listen what [to] the doctor had to say; as we went through the symptoms. The doctor recommended that some; but not all of the flight attendants take a medication called Diphenhydramine to counter the symptoms. And he also recommended that we land as soon as possible. As a side note; the medication was NOT in the med kit the doctor said it should be. It was in the cockpit med kit. So his information needs to be updated/corrected.The decision was made to return to [the departure airport] because they have excellent medical facilities; longer runways; and some of the passengers originated from there. It was about a two hour flight to return from that point; and we were still looking at an overweight landing. We requested a turn back for medical reasons. We got immediate priority without requesting it.I had [the Purser] pass her Purser duties to [another flight attendant]; and directed that her and 2 other flight attendants with the worst symptoms take the pills. That gave us a minimum crew of 5 FAs (Flight Attendants). We checked their status every 10 minutes; and told them to let us know ASAP if they got worse; in case we needed to divert somewhere closer. Most of them reported feeling better; especially after taking oxygen. They did measure their oxygen levels with the oxygen meter in the quick response kit. Initially; their O2 levels were unusually low; in the mid-80s.We asked ATC for lower altitudes for two reasons; lower cabin altitude; and higher fuel burn because we were projecting an overweight landing. On the way; we reviewed the Smoke and Fumes Elimination; Ozone; Bio Hazard and Overweight checklists. Only the Overweight Landing checklist could apply. We did have an overweight landing (+/-4;000 lbs). That was necessary due to the nature of the emergency; we could not remain in the air longer to burn more fuel. Autobrakes disconnected on landing and manual braking was required. The left main gear temperatures were reading 4s by the time we exited [the runway]. [It was] a short taxi to the remote parking stand; and it took a few minutes for the ground personnel to install wheel chocks. By then; the left main landing gear temperatures had climbed to 9s. The left rear tire fuse melted and the tire deflated. Fire department; medical and mechanic personnel met the airplane and took care of the situation from there.Flight attendants and some passengers were taken to the airport clinic. They felt OK and released shortly after. We found out next day that all flight attendants tested positive for CO2. Their symptoms during the flight verified that fact.,B767 flight crew reported a return to departure airport after several flight attendants and some passengers became lightheaded; dizzy; and nauseous. The flight attendants later tested positive for CO2.

Upon approach for landing the fumes returned; only much worse. Did not smell like dirty socks or vomit. There was no haze or smoke. The odor was acrid; burning oily chemicals.Upon arrival at the gate I went to the cockpit to discuss with the Captain and couldn't cross the threshold into the cockpit as the fumes were much; much worse. An immediate headache; burning eyes; throat and chest area.All Flight Attendants (FA) congregated on the loading bridge. EMTs arrived and took all of our blood pressures; gave us an EKG and recorded out 02 levels. 2 FAs' blood pressure was so high that they were transported to the emergency room. All of our blood pressures were significantly higher than normal. Return flight was cancelled. We deadheaded back. [It was] recommended that I go to the Emergency Room. Blood Pressure; EKG and blood test revealed no CO in my body. No blood test was done for inhalation of fumes. [I was] informed that there was no such test--at least it was not done at this hospital. They were unaware of any such test.I continued to have a headache for over a week; tightness/heaviness in the chest--like bronchitis/chest cold--short term memory loss and brain fog for several days.,A330 cabin crew reported smelling an odd odor in flight. After landing the reporters received medical attention for the effects of the odor.

While turning onto centerline I brought the engines up to stable power. When I was lined up I selected TOGA power; because of the strong left crosswind. The plane immediately began to yaw right. I tried to steer left with the tiller; then pulled off the power; then utilized asymmetric braking. When I got the plane straight; I exited at the next taxiway. The aircraft behind us reported to Tower that we hit a runway edge light; but we didn't feel it. The First Officer called the Tower and told them we're rejecting; then told the passengers to remain seated. After we exited the runway [First Officer] ran the rejected takeoff checklist. We taxied uneventfully back to the gate.,A320 flight crew reported losing directional control while commencing the takeoff roll in strong crosswind conditions. The aircraft remained on the runway; however; it did strike runway edge lighting.

We noticed the FOB (Fuel on Board) was decreasing below 7.0. The winds were higher than forecast so we didn't think much of it. We did decide to climb ahead of schedule since the winds were no worse higher in an attempt to get back on our burn schedule. Upon reaching [the midpoint of the flight] FOB had decreased significantly more; around 4.5 if I remember correctly. This is when we first became concerned that we may need to do a fuel stop if the winds did not subside and the burn trend reverse. We texted dispatch with our FOB and concern. I noticed an 800lb fuel imbalance so I did a cross feed while waiting to hear back from dispatch. Dispatch said he was showing us crossing the fixes +/- 200 lbs. After a couple more exchanges with dispatch the FOB had dropped to 3.5. We did a FMC position report; dispatch was showing the same thing +/- 200 lbs. The fuel had become imbalanced again so we started looking at alternative explanations than un-forecasted winds. As the FOB dropped to 3.0 we decided we were going to have to fuel stop at a minimum. Meanwhile Dispatch had sent us a flight plan to [an alternate] if we wanted to; but his info was still showing we were on plan. We had 16.5 FOB at this time so we did not feel pressure to act rashly. We looked at options and tried to explain the discrepancy. We did the fuel leak check list and it appeared that we had enough symptoms to confirm that we had a probable leak. We had plenty of fuel so we decided it was not prudent to create another emergency by shutting down #2 engine. We discussed when we would continue check list and shut it down. We determined 2000 lbs in # 2 tank as our bottom line for shut down. At the same time as discussions and checklist were ongoing we started the divert.We did a normal landing [at the alternate] with both engines running. We had Fire department check for visible signs of leak. The said #2 was leaking. We shut it down on the taxiway and confirmed the leak had stopped prior to proceeding to gate.,Boeing 737 flight crew reported a fuel burn in excess of that expected for the flight. Troubleshooting suggested a fuel leak and a successful diversion to a suitable airport was accomplished.

I asked them to clean up the cabin early so as to be done and seated prior to the choppy air at the lower altitudes. Just a few seconds later; my First Officer (FO) said that he would like to use the lavatory prior to landing. We also had a Company Captain Observer on the jump seat; and he expressed interest in doing the same. My FO went first and returned promptly then the Observer left. As I recall we were given a descent clearance to FL 350 as the FO initiated the descent; the Observer called to come back to the flight deck. I got up from my seat to check the door viewer and open the door and as I returned to my seat we started to get some vibration or bumps. Within a few seconds the Flight Attendants called to ask about the noise and vibration.As I was explaining to them we were entering some chop; I noticed that the autothrottle had disconnected and the #2 engine was rolling back. I tried to move the thrust lever but had no response. After realizing what we were dealing with I set CONT thrust in the FMC and found the single engine drift down speed. I immediately asked ATC for a lower altitude. I told the FO to continue to fly the aircraft while I got out the Engine Failure/Shutdown Checklist. As I was going to the QRH; I re-assessed the situation and felt that the Engine Fire/Severe Damage Checklist may be more appropriate because of the engine vibration we felt (Nothing abnormal on the AVI.)  As we performed the checklist and shutdown the engine; the vibration stopped. At that point we also had the 'ENG FAIL' annunciation. We never had a fire or overheat light. Our Flight Deck Observer was extremely helpful in helping me with communication to Dispatch; Flight Attendants and the Passengers.I had initially told ATC that most likely we would land at ZZZ (landing alternate for our destination.)  We were given a direct clearance to ZZZ airport. However; after attaining the weather for both ZZZ and zZZ1 I felt that in the interest of Safety that ZZZ1 would be a better option as both were approximately the same distance. My concerns for landing at ZZZ were turbulence; moderate icing on descent and gusty crosswinds on the long runway or a much shorter runway with favorable winds. My concern was I knew we would have additional speed with a flap 15 (ice) landing with a fairly heavy weight landing of about 127;500 pounds. The decision was made to land at ZZZ1 with overcast skies no ice and a smooth ride with light winds straight down a 12;000 ft runway. After all appropriate checklists; briefings and calls were made I assumed control of the aircraft and we landed at ZZZ1 without further incident. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) met us after landing and I stopped the aircraft on the taxiway after we cleared the runway. I wanted CFR to assess any potential visual damage prior to proceeding to the gate. No apparent damage was noted so we continued to Gate. Upon reaching the gate we advised the Passengers that Customer Service Agents would help accommodate them to their destinations. I then called Dispatch and spoke to all of the appropriate channels to debrief the incident. This included Dispatch; Maintenance and the Chief Pilot on Call. I entered a defect noting the #2 engine failure in the aircraft logbook. I then conducted an outside walk around the aircraft in particular looking at the #2 engine. Both the Contract Mechanic and I did not notice anything unusual or apparently abnormal with the engine.  However; we did have a red EGT exceedance annunciation on the ground. The highest observed EGT was 788 in flight prior to shut down. The aircraft was shut down except for overnight gate services accommodations.,A B737 Captain reported an engine rollback at cruise requiring a diversion and emergency landing.

I also had a metallic taste in my mouth. Soon thereafter one flight attendant had respiratory problems and seemed to have a temperature. Before we could leave the airport she was vomiting in the bathroom. When we got to the hospital her blood pressure was way off. Three of us were seen and one flight attendant spent the night at the hospital in observation.Engine oil getting into the bleed air system most likely number 2 engine.Would be great to have a meter and warning in the cockpit when toxins enter the bleed system.,A321 pilot reported several crew members detected an odor and a metallic taste during descent.

After performing a gate return for an engine valve issue and subsequent MEL we had a normal take off. Climbing through 6;000 feet we heard a very loud air noise; which we initially thought was rain/weather. No weather was present so I was tasked to check the cabin in case we had a door come open or something similar but the noise was present mainly in the cockpit. This was later determined to possibly be a blown duct. After the noise occurred we checked the status page and we had a landing gear monitor message. At the same time; the Maintenance person that [the Company] had tasked to ride with us had a specific piece of equipment to monitor the O2 content in the aircraft. As we leveled at 13;000 feet his monitor started making an audible alarm and noticeable flash and when I saw the screen I could see that the O2 content was not normal. We now had three issues occurring at the same time that we felt necessitated an air return which also was going to include an overweight landing in ZZZZ. As the Relief Officer (IRO) I looked up the overweight landing checklist and attempted to run it but there was some confusion among the three of us as to exactly how to run that checklist. It kept referring me to the performance section for the correct chart and for some reason I found that chart exceptionally difficult to understand. That checklist is somewhat confusing I think in the heat of battle. What was great was the ability of the iPad to remember what page I was on in the checklist and also to be able to 'hotlink' me to the correct sections and move back and forth - that feature is fabulous. I had to prompt the crew several times that we needed to run this overweight landing checklist which also contains the approach descent and landing checklists. The captain had his hands full flying the heavy aircraft and getting it properly slowed down and configured. The margins were very narrow on the speed tape. There was also some discussion of trying to 'document' what was happening which I eventually had to express very forcefully that the focus should be on flying the aircraft first. That was a definite threat which in a different scenario could have been very dangerous. With a heavy; slow plane like that; one person should have been totally focused on flying and at times that focus appeared to be wandering slightly. After we were able to get all the checklists ran we made a normal VFR approach and landing the slightly longer runway. ZZZZ had to suspend takeoffs for us I believe for us to land.,A B767 flight crew reported returning to land due to several indications of malfunctions on the aircraft.

I realized I did not activate [approach mode] and auto throttle increased power ending in flap overspeed [and] unstable [approach]. Vectored for another approach; landed overweight uneventfully. ARFF met plane on runway; noted no indications of smoke or fire. Due to weight and TO conditions performed TOGA TO APU On. Possible oil ingestion from APU into packs. It was a learning experience. I realized upon the go around I had rushed the whole event. Entering the yellow border in red resource management. My FO did a wonderful job help bring us into the green. My future goal is not to rush to comply but to sit back; assess; and proceed.,A321 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after Flight Attendants reported smoke in the cabin. Crew felt rushed; and an unstabilized approach resulted in a go-around.

Number 1 & Number 3 flight crew affected with massive headache and sleepiness. Remained seated due to symptoms and turbulence. At 20 min after departure attempted service for 10 min. Suspended service as Number 1 was vomiting in lavatory Number 1 returned and called CA (Captain) regarding Number 1 & Number 3 flight crew incapacitation. FO (First Officer) checked forward cabin area for fumes and odor. FO explained left engine air intake directed to ventilation system in forward area by jump seats. FO said deicing fluid can get into cabin air. I (Number 3) explained my deteriorating condition to FO. FO returned to cockpit. Number 1 returned and I sat in jump seat and struck my left knee on edge of jump seat. Number 1 brought 2 O2 bottles and I began using O2. Number 1 called POC (Physician on Call) for assistance. I had sensation of spiraling downward; confusion; but remained conscious. Number 1 called Number 2. Number 2 & Number 4 completed entire service in both cabins. Number 1 again called POC and requested paramedics meet the flight. After O2 administration I regained mental clarity. Headache remained. Flight landed without further incident. Paramedics assisted me immediately. Passengers deplaned as I was examined I did not go to the hospital at that time as I only had headache remaining.,B737 Flight Attendant reported an odor in cabin after takeoff causing headache and sleepiness. Two of the four Flight Attendants were unable to perform their assigned duties during this flight.

Immediately after rotation; we both noticed an odor in the cockpit that smelled like a mixture of burning electrical and burning oil/hydraulic fluid. Initially; we thought it may have been residual [De-ice]/anti ice fluid; as the aircraft was towed in from another location; (we had not accepted our first aircraft due to maintenance issues). We determined after a brief discussion that the aircraft had not needed deicing; and the smell must be coming from elsewhere. It was not dissipating.After cleanup and reaching a safe altitude; we briefly discussed the smell; which was not dissipating. I felt slightly light headed; and I was getting a dry; tingling feeling in the back of my throat. I recognized these from my military altitude chamber hypoxia symptoms; and informed [the] Captain of my condition. As PF; I immediately donned my oxygen mask while [the] Captain got into the QRH; ran the checklists; and tried to coordinate with Flight attendants (FA's) to see if they could smell the odor as well. The FA's informed us that they could smell it; and it was getting more potent. [The] Captain Notified ATC of [our issue] and coordinated a return. After a few minutes; I was noticing the Captain having difficulty with basic FMS functions and told him he should immediately don his mask; as I feared he was also experiencing signs of hypoxia. After donning his mask; he was able to return to normal; and we worked in tandem to get the aircraft turned around and back to the departure airport.I flew and talked on the radio; and the Captain manipulated the FMS and checklists. We received a single frequency approach controller; and flew an ILS to the runway; with an overweight landing of approximately 163;000 lbs with a light touchdown and stopped on the runway while the emergency responding vehicles inspected our aircraft. Once given the all clear; we taxied back to the gate; remaining on oxygen the entire time until engines were shut down. We opened the flight deck windows for ventilation after we parked; and removed our masks. We were met at the aircraft by EMS; Fire; and Police first responders; who ran our vitals and transported us to the local Emergency Room. We were unable to pinpoint the cause of the fumes; but they persisted throughout the flight; approach; and landing. At this time; we do not know why this event occurred; where the fumes originated; or what could be done to minimize the risk. All hydraulic; oil; and bleed configurations and levels were normal.,B737 flight crew reported experiencing fumes in both the cockpit and cabin; which were nearly incapacitating; the flight safely returned to the departure airport.

The cabin altitude had climbed to 10;100 feet MSL. We initiated the QRC; and with the selector in manual; the cabin continued to slowly climb. We started an emergency descent and as we descended through about FL250; the Cabin Altitude started to descend. We had notified Center of the Emergency. We continued down to 10;000 feet MSL and diverted to an Airport which was about 200 NM away. We were VFR the whole time. Next; we realized we would be overweight or have to hold at the Airport. We talked to the Flight Attendants to brief and check on them and the Passengers. They said a few Passengers were complaining about their ears and some felt light headed. Since the cabin was at 5000 feet MSL; we chose not to deploy the masks and asked them to use the portable Oxygen if needed. After a Public Address from the flight deck and Flight Attendants; the Passenger seemed fine except for some isolated ear issues. We chose to land overweight after running the Performance data because of the Passenger discomfort reported. We continued onto the Airport at 10;000 feet MSL and did a visual RNAV landing to the Runway. It was on overweight at 133;900 pounds. Crash Fire Rescue and EMS met the aircraft.  One Passenger asked to see the EMS about her ears. The First Officer and Flight Attendants handled all issues very professionally.,Boeing 737 flight crew reported difficulty maintaining proper cabin pressure; they stabilized the cabin pressure by reverting to manual control; and a decision was made to divert due to passengers discomfort.

Also amber 'TCAS' EICAS and 'SPD LMT' at bottom of both speed tapes on PFDs. Had an LCA (Line Check Airman) in the jump seat giving us a 'Line Check'. After consulting with Dispatch and [Maintenance Control] and three cockpit pilots; we all agreed we need to return. Cockpit communication was difficult when the aural warning was sounding. We [advised ATC] and landed. Returned to gate.,B767 flight crew reported multiple visual and aural configuration warnings after retracting the flaps during climb out.

We notified Departure of our situation. We ran QRC and QRH checklists. We notified Ops and Company Dispatch of our situation and return to the airport. Flight Attendants were briefed and announcements were made to the Passengers of our intent to return. We made an overweight landing at flaps 15 at 131.0 lbs. Landing was smooth and uneventful. Aircraft was stopped on the runway for inspection by the crash; fire and rescue Crews. No damage was noted and we taxied to the gate. Passengers were offloaded and Maintenance was briefed.,B737 First Officer reported multiple compressor stalls on takeoff. The flight crew elected to return to the departure airport.

A Flight Attendant called the cockpit with the emergency signal and relayed that fire was visible from the number 2 engine. We contacted the Tower Controller; climbed to a safe altitude below a high overcast while turning and flying the Engine Out Procedure as briefed. We performed checklists; contacted Flight Attendants; Ops and Dispatch and made a PA to passengers. We returned for an uneventful; normal landing.  We stopped on centerline and requested the Ground Rescue Crew to inspect the aircraft. Following their negative report; we taxied to the gate with Rescue vehicle following and monitoring. Parking; shutdown; deplaning passengers and post flight were normal.,B737-700 Captain reported returning to departure airport after experiencing multiple compressor stalls on Number 2 engine shortly after takeoff.

At least; until about half way across the country. On my audio panel; I had the cabin inter-phone volume up; and overheard the Flight Attendants discussing a medical issue with a passenger who was laying on the back galley floor due to low blood pressure and feeling faint. When the number 1 (Flight Attendant) called me; she said that they had made an announcement for a doctor on board; and there was one who was attending to the woman; and also it appeared that she would be 'okay'.I requested that they make a call to the Physician on Call (POC) using their Wi-Fi phone; and gave them the desk number. At that point; I also decided to contact dispatch and get them in the loop. We discussed using ZZZ if a medical diversion was required. Dispatch said the Flight Attendants were talking to the POC and agreed on our diversion choices if needed. First Officer and I called up the weather; ATIS (ZZZ); reviewed the Jeppesen; and calculated our landing distances. ZZZ would be right on the line. It was very fortuitous that we did all this pre-planning; because about 20 minutes later we had to put that plan into action.All of a sudden; there was a muffled bang sound; followed by a loud whirling continuous noise like an electric motor that was failing. At the same time; there was also a small vibration that reminded me of a radar antenna motor going bad; so I immediately switched the unit off. That wasn't the problem. Next; our number 1 Flight Attendant called and said she heard a large bang by the one Right (1R) door. After she hung up; First Officer and I both thought we had a possible aircraft structural problem that may cause a rapid decompression; and we asked for a lower altitude of 14;000 feet. At this point; we knew we probably weren't going to destination.Now the noise was accompanied by an acrid electrical smell. I said let's get on oxygen and get into the smoke and fumes checklist. I handed the aircraft over to the First Officer and said tell them we want to divert to ZZZ. The number 1 called to say she smelled smoke; however when I tried to communicate with her through the oxygen mask microphone; she could not understand what I was saying. There was a loud feedback squeal in the speaker when I transmitted; and further complicating the situation; she could not understand what was being said from the poor quality of the oxygen mask microphone. After several attempts with the speaker causing a large feedback squeal; I took the mask off long enough to tell her to prepare for a landing and do a '30 second review;' I also made a quick announcement to the passengers to return to their seats; and I turned the seatbelt sign back on. It was at this time I noticed that the smoke abated but the loud humming noise continued. With the smoke subsiding; I discontinued the Smoke/Fumes Checklist after the first couple of steps. In hindsight; I should have continued beyond step 2 in the checklist; but the lack of communication distraction took me out of it until it was no longer needed.We removed our oxygen masks; briefed the approach; ran the Emergency Landing Checklist; and discussed the situation and our threats to the remainder of the flight. With the situation a little better at hand; I 'all called' the Flight Attendants and gave them a proper briefing; and said we were expecting a normal landing and taxi to the gate. I made a better; more detailed Public Address to the passengers and explained that I requested EMS to be on hand so expect to see some 'flashing lights!' We agreed that we would shoot the ZZZ ILS and leave it on the autopilot; in case the smoke started back up again. Fortunately; it did not and we successfully shot the approach; and I disconnected the Autopilot at 500 feet and got probably the smoothest landing.Once at taxi speed I made a 'remain seated 3x Public Address' and we continued to [the] gate; and deplaned using the Jetway uneventfully. Shortly after shut down while debriefing maintenance; the motor whirring noise got louder and the acrid electronics odor returned. Next; we got an ECAM 'AVIONICS SMOKE' message. I followed the QRH 'IMMEDIATE ACTION' checklist and shortly thereafter; the noise stopped; but only after the 'AV/VENT EXTRACT FAN'; circuit breaker (AC 4) popped. That concluded the evening's excitement!One final thought; First Officer related an Oxygen Mask communications procedure from a previous airline; where they would put their headsets over the oxygen mask and turn the speakers off; hence no feedback problems! I use a molded ear-piece and believe that would also work. The current procedure with the microphone/speaker feedback is unsafe and completely unacceptable!,A321 Captain reported diverting due to in-flight smoke and fumes from an apparent electrical problem followed by difficulties communicating through the oxygen masks.

No passengers were affected that we know. We descended to 28;000 feet and gave some oxygen to the Flight Attendants which seemed to help. The flight continued without incident.,B767 flight crew reported the flight attendants felt ill and dizziness during flight.

We placed temperature controls in full cold and continued to monitor. They reported fumes continued and we turned off recirculate fans and referred to QRH for procedural guidance. FA reported fumes were not clearing and getting worse. Captain conferred with Company and I continue to fly aircraft and we commenced reviewing 'Smoke; Fumes; and Fire' in cabin checklist. FAs reported fumes were worsening and aft cabin lights were flickering on and off. We decided as a crew to divert. Captain conferred with Company and communicated with FAs monitoring the fume situation. Captain executed Smoke; Fumes and Fire Checklist as I obtained ATIS and executed Divert Checklist as best as possible considering time shortage. FAs reported smoke present in aft part of cabin as we got nearer to [divert field]. Captain decided and FO (First Officer) concurred; that upon landing we would clear the runway and then evacuate the aircraft. We cleared the runway; stopped the aircraft on a taxiway; and accomplished the Evacuation Checklist. We then gathered Passengers in two groups and assessed for injuries. There were five to seven injuries that we were aware of that received some level of medical treatment.,B737NG First Officer reported diverting after Flight Attendants advised of fumes and smoke in the cabin.

We turned the pack to a colder temperature thinking it may be getting too warm and told them we would check back in about two minutes. We called and they said it was the same; so I told them I was turning off the recirculation fans to see if that made any difference and it did not. At that time; we decided to divert; land; and have it checked by Maintenance. We called Dispatch to coordinate the off schedule arrival. During the descent the Flight Attendant called and told us the lights in the aft galley and cabin were beginning to flicker I told them to turn them off and we would be landing shortly.  The First Officer was flying the aircraft so we set up to go directly to the Airport and we began running the Smoke and Fumes Checklist. The Flight Attendant called us and said the cabin was beginning to have visible smoke. We identified to ATC as an emergency and requested the fire truck meet us upon landing. With the situation becoming worse in a period of approximately 10 minutes; I did not want to risk the safety of the passengers so I asked the Flight Attendants to prepare for evacuation upon arrival. They did so and we landed and taxied just off the runway and evacuated the aircraft on the taxiway. The fire trucks met us and helped with the passengers exiting the aircraft. We assisted the passengers and bused them to the terminal as quickly as possible.,B737-800 Captain reported that the cabin crew notified them of smoke and fumes in the aft galley; which led to a decision to divert and evacuate on the taxiway.

I asked him if there was any smoke or fumes and he replied there were no issues. I told him not to reset the Circuit Breaker (CB) and asked him to call me back if anything changed. Shortly after that as we were nearing FL300 he called back and reported a very strange and strong smell in the aft cabin and that the oven was extremely hot. No visible smoke or fire was reported; but the First Officer (FO) and I began to smell something similar to the smell of burning rubber in the cockpit. At that time we completed the memory items for the Smoke/Fumes checklist and notified Center that we and wanted to divert approximately off our nose. I let the FA's know we were diverting and would be on the ground in about 10 minutes and to prepare for a normal landing. I also informed the passengers that we would be going to [divert] due to a mechanical issue.During the descent the FO sent a message to dispatch; communicated with ATC and we reprogrammed our destination to [diversion airport]. I kept the speed above 250 below 10;000 in order to get the aircraft down to pattern altitude as well as the the concern that there may be a fire that wasn't apparently visible. We completed most of the Smoke/Fumes checklist as we were approaching the airport. I checked with the FA in back and verified no change in status in the cabin.On final I pushed for Managed Speed but we had missed activating the approach phase and the aircraft briefly accelerated to approximately 3 knots above the limit for flaps one. The remainder of the approach was normal with a normal landing about 1;000 pounds over max landing weight. After landing we cleared the runway and I verified with our FA that there was still no smoke or fire and got a confirmation from the fire rescue truck that all appeared OK. We taxied to the gate and when we opened the cockpit door there was a very strong odor in the cabin. Fire rescue boarded the aircraft and confirmed via thermal sensor that the malfunctioning oven was still very warm (250 degrees) and at least 150 degrees warmer than the other oven.This was a very time compressed event as the time from the top of descent to landing was probably no more than 10-12 min. with many tasks to accomplish in a very short time. Overall I feel we did a good job based on the information with only one or two minor mistakes during the event.,A319 Captain reported that during the climbout it was discovered that a circuit breaker had opened in in the aft galley; accompanied by strong fumes a few minutes later. After accomplishing the Smoke/Fumes Checklist; the Captain successfully diverted to the nearest suitable airport.

Controller was quite enthusiastic about the amount of smoke and that it was only the right engine affected. Our engine instruments showed normal but we asked for vectors for a downwind to assess situation. As we were getting vectors we attempted to reach Dispatch/Maintenance via SATCOM but were unable to contact. We had our Flight Attendants do a visual assessment out the windows and they reported no smoke that they could see. We asked for an approach to ZZZ so that our maintenance and/or the Fire Department could assess if there was excessive smoke from the right engine. After the approach the tower again reiterated very excessive smoke from the right engine on climb out.At this time we were finally able to contact Dispatch and Maintenance who said there was no excessive oil consumption and that he couldn't detect any abnormalities with either engine. We discussed that the excessive smoke seemed to be when the engines were at a higher power setting. By the time we conferred with Maintenance we informed Dispatch that we only had about 84;000 lbs of fuel and were concerned that it was well below our MINTO of 88.8. We were also planned well south of the normal routes due to weather and rides. We felt that the best decision was to return to ZZZ to refuel and at the same time we could have Maintenance do an inspection of the engine as well. It was decided we would dump fuel to our max landing weight and return to ZZZ.We informed ATC that we needed to dump fuel and were told to hold at ZZZZZat 5;000 feet. At XA48Z with the fuel at 82;200 lbs we initiated the Fuel Jettison Procedure. Shortly after initiating the fuel jettison we received a Fuel Jettison Main EICAS telling us that the right main fuel jettison had malfunctioned. We discontinued dumping at this point as per the Fuel Jettison Main checklist at XA53 with 72;000 lbs of fuel remaining. We contacted Maintenance again and informed him of the jettison malfunction and that we would be doing an overweight landing at ZZZ.ATC and the company were informed of our return and we requested the fire trucks nearby for our landing. We did a 30 flaps landing at approximately 472;000 lbs to a very smooth touchdown.Maintenance inspected the engine and determined that the engine intermix probably played a large part in the concern from ATC on our takeoff because the left engine was relatively new and the right was considerably older. The mechanic also said he noted the excessive smoke in the right engine vs. the left but didn't feel that it was any more than a normal amount. The engine was inspected with no findings of problems; the overweight landing inspection was completed; and a new flight plan was filed with an MEL item of the right main fuel jettison inop. I contacted the flight operations as soon as we returned to the gate to report our incident and airport return and informed them that the crew was ready to go as soon as the proper maintenance and paperwork were done. We received the new release and flight plan release and left the gate as soon as we had everything.On taxi-out the tower controller asked what we found out about the right engine and proceeded to again express how highly alarmed he was by the amount of smoke on takeoff. We explained to him why there was such a difference between the engines due to the intermix and thanked him for his vigilance and concern. The flight to ZZZ1 was completed without further incident.,B777 flight crew reported being advised by the Tower of excessive smoke coming from an engine during takeoff and returned to land overweight.

Oil Quantity Gauge went from 80 percent to 0 in about 25 minutes. We called Dispatch and explained the situation and they patched us to Maintenance Control. They informed us that it was most likely the gauge and if no amber or red lights appeared; then that was what was occurring. We continued on to [our destination] and monitored it very carefully. About ten minutes later we both notice the oil pressure also going from 39 percent to 36 percent but stable indicators and still no lights. As the oil pressure depleted to around 20 percent and a flash of amber on the engine control; we decided to make a precautionary landing [at an alternate airport]. ATC cleared us direct and descend to 12;000 feet. Disconnected the autothrottles and pulled the power to idle as not to strain the motor. Check list was pulled and followed for a possible single engine landing. The First Officer; online four months; did a great job. We informed the Flight Attendants and passengers that we were landing [at the alternate airport] as a precaution. 10 miles on final approach; the red light came on and we [advised ATC] and shut the motor down. We landed single engine with no other issues.,B737 flight crew reported a loss of oil quantity which resulted in an engine shutdown; and a successful diversion to a suitable airport.

At rotation; we heard a loud bang followed by a yaw to aircraft left. I was told by the F/O that the number 1 engine was showing an overtemp with an associated ECAM advisory. I; the Captain; was able to maintain control; but the aircraft was slow to climb. The First Officer ran the ECAM; which instructed pulling the thrust lever to idle. Tried to engaged the autopilot but it click off; flew [straight] ahead with permission from departure control. We reported our emergency and told departure we need to return to the field. We were having problems with the automation; especially the auto thrust system; [it] would not hold constant airspeed. On the first ILS approach; [we] engage auto pilot one more time. System did not intercept the GS and got us fast on the approach. At this time at approximately 2000 ft AGL; we broke off the approach and decided to disconnect the auto thrust system and auto pilot and I hand flew the ILS to 27R. Landed; stopped on the runway to have the fire department look us over. They stated that it looked like there was a small fire in the number 1 engine. We shut it down on the runway. No more indication of a fire; taxied to the gate; normal disembarkment of the passenger. No injuries.,Air carrier flight crew and one observer pilot reported an engine failure during take off.

At the same time; there was also a small vibration. Shortly after; our #1 Flight Attendant called and said she heard a large bang by the 1 Right (1R) door. After she hung up; we thought we had a possible aircraft structural problem that may cause a rapid decompression; and we asked for a lower altitude of 14;000 feet. Now the noise was accompanied by an acrid electrical smell. The Captain and I got on oxygen and began the smoke/avionics smoke/fumes immediate action item checklist. I [informed ATC of our situation] and told them we want to divert. The #1 Flight Attendant called to say she smelled smoke; however when the Captain tried to communicate with her through the oxygen mask microphone; she could not understand what I was saying. There was a loud feedback squeal in the speaker when he transmitted; and further complicating the situation; she could not understand what was being said from the poor quality of the oxygen mask microphone.After several attempts with the speaker causing a large feedback squeal; the Captain took the mask off long enough to tell her to prepare for a landing and do a '30 second review;' he also made a quick announcement to the passengers to return to their seats; and turned the seatbelt sign back on. It was at this time he noticed that the smoke abated but the loud humming noise continued. With the smoke subsiding; he discontinued the Smoke/Fumes checklist after the first couple of steps. In hindsight; we should have continued beyond step 2 in the checklist; but the lack of communication distraction caused us to pause the checklist until it was no longer needed.I don't think it is possible to prevent the smoke/fumes events from occurring. But I feel [the airline] could drastically improve training to handle these events. Communicating with the Captain while wearing the oxygen mask was difficult; and it was nearly impossible for him to communicate with the flight attendants. When discussing the ABC's of Threat and Error Management we are trained to communicate all threats and intentions. We were able to accomplish our tasks with a successful outcome; but it could have been much easier without the confusion from hindered communication.Before I came to [this airline]; I spent 8 years in the training department at [another airline]. In addition to supervising all Line and Simulator Check Airmen I was responsible for all of our training curriculum. I was contacted by a Captain who had a smoke event shortly after takeoff. At the time we trained to don the oxygen masks; turn on the intercom; and turn on the speaker. This resulted in both pilots hearing each other breathing through the masks over the speakers. The Captain of the flight said it was nearly impossible to communicate with the First Officer and Air Traffic Control. We changed our procedures and produced a video that was shown during all initial; upgrade; and recurrent simulator training. After donning the oxygen masks we trained to put on your headset and use the intercom only when communicating with the other pilot to reduce feedback and background noise.I understand the company has agreed to revisit the SMOKE/FUMES procedures. I feel the immediate actions for smoke/avionics smoke/fumes could be improved. I think the communication issue could be solved by training to put on your headset after the oxygen masks are on. I would add something along the lines of crew communication: establish to the Immediate Action checklist and even consider making the first 2-3 steps memory items. I would train these procedures during all initial and upgrade training and then revisit them annually.,A319 First Officer reported a muffled bang sound; followed by smoke in the cabin and difficulty communicating through the crew oxygen masks.

The flight attendants told me that the smell got worse towards the aft galley. They had initial concerns there might be a problem with an engine so they had run forward to look out the windows and saw nothing abnormal. We immediately asked for a level off from ATC while we looked into the problem. We leveled off at 13;000 feet. The Captain decided I should go aft and take a look so we coordinated for a flight attendant to come forward while I went aft to investigate. When I reached the aft half of the cabin; I did smell a slight odor that smelled more like exhaust than burning rubber to me; but it was very slight and barely noticeable. I did not see any smoke or haze. When I asked the flight attendants if they saw any smoke or haze they initially said no. I also asked them if they were feeling OK and they said yes. I then went back to the cockpit and told the Captain what I had seen and heard. Our initial thoughts were about the tires since the smell was like burning rubber and we didn't feel like there was any issue about the tires. Since the smell had almost completely dissipated; we were heavyweight; and there was no one claiming any effects; we initially elected to press on to destination; but would continue to monitor the situation. Almost immediately after the Captain talked with the flight attendants again; two of the flight attendants (#3 and #4) told the Captain they were feeling dizzy and light-headed. We immediately decided we needed to [advise ATC] and return to [the departure airport]. We had the flight attendants query the passengers and we initially determined 8 passengers were claiming they felt ill. We did not smell anything on the flight deck; but we decided I should don my mask as a precaution. The Captain flew an uneventful visual approach and uneventful overweight (approximately 154;000 lb) landing and we taxied to the hold bay for Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to inspect the aircraft. ARFF did not note any damage after inspection. Although ARFF was prepared to get airstairs and have EMTs board to check the passengers who were feeling ill. However; when we checked again; only the two flight attendants were feeling ill so ARFF asked us to taxi back to the gate. We taxied to the gate and EMS checked the two flight attendants and we deplaned the passengers. Although the two flight attendants later reported they felt ok; they were pulled off of the trip. After block-in; I did a post-flight walk around and did not see anything out of the ordinary. We did fill out an online smoke; fume; and odor form and submitted it online. My understanding after talking with management is that a cabin recirculation fan had failed and a circuit breaker had popped and that was the reason for the smell of burning rubber. We did not know this at the time though. We need a better checklist for handling smoke; fumes; or odors as the current QRH seems to be all about eliminating smoke from a possible fire. Although we referenced it; I felt it was inadequate in determining what type of odor was occurring or how to respond appropriately in this situation.,B737 First Officer reported that there was a smell of burning rubber in the cabin prompting a return to the departure airport.

I was First Officer flying in the right seat; IRO was Pilot Monitoring (PM); and Captain was on break. There was a bang and the aircraft yawed to the left. N1 and N2 on the left side were decreasing. I announced 'Engine Failure'; disconnected the Autothrottles and Autopilot; and assumed positive aircraft control. I then confirmed it was the left side with the PM and retarded the left thrust lever to idle. I called for the QRH and asked the IRO to identify as an emergency and request lower (Engine Out altitude was FL 230). We would eventually descend to FL 200.During the drift down; we started the QRH and when it got to the part about restart; we discussed our options. Left N1 was 25%; Left N2 was around 26%; fuel flow was .6; Vibration (VIB) was normal; oil quantity was normal. The abnormal indications were that EPR was blank; Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) was rising into the red (it would eventually peak at 1002); and oil pressure was decreasing and in the red.We had asked for a heading to ZZZZ during the initial drift down. My thought process was that I was very familiar with the facilities at ZZZZ and if we somehow were able to get the engine restarted; I would prefer that. It also pointed us in the same general direction as ZZZZ1; so it didn't cost us anything by heading that way.During the restart discussion; the cabin call chime rang and the Captain was at the door. She took her seat and we caught her up on the situation. We transferred aircraft control and continued the discussion about restart. The Left Autopilot was engaged and then there were two rapid engine surges and she directed us to continue the QRH as all thoughts of a restart were discarded. The IRO read the QRH while I (PM) performed the steps. We all confirmed irreversible actions (fuel control and Fire Handle). At this point we had leveled off at FL 200 and decided that ZZZZ1 was the nearest suitable field (Weather was VFR with light winds and was provided by ATC). Checklist was completed up to the deferred items for the landing checklist. ZZZZ1 was about 160 NM away by this point.We then transferred aircraft control and the Captain gave the briefing to the Flight Attendants and made a Public Address (PA) to the passengers. While she was doing that I coordinated the divert with ATC; passed them the Souls on Board and fuel and notified Dispatch. Dispatch had previously gotten word somehow that we were an emergency and sent us a message; but I hadn't had time to respond. Once the Captain was done with her PA. She assumed aircraft control and asked us if there was anything else we needed to be thinking; or if could think of anything we may have missed. We then flew a southeast visual to the Runway; backed up by the LOC; exited the runway at the end and were inspected by CFR (Crash Fire Rescue). Nothing critical being discovered; we taxied to the ramp and did the parking checklist. Once the air stairs were in place we talked the CFR chief and terminated the emergency with ground.,B767 flight crew reported an engine failure in cruise followed by a diversion to the nearest suitable airfield.

At that time we begin increasing climb to avoid traffic simultaneously TCAS RA came. We turned further right to avoid traffic and complied with RA by climbing faster. Traffic was in sight the whole time. According to TCAS we probably missed the traffic by about 300-500 ft. Told tower we were following RA. Then returned to heading and altitude assigned when clear of conflict.,B737 flight crew reported responding to a RA on initial climb out.

ATC tried to adjust aircraft in front of us; but we were all speed limited to 156 and higher due to arrival wind conditions. ATC initiated a missed approach using improper phraseology then [said it] correctly the second time; during which we went to Control Wheel Steering (CWS) mode when; coincidentally; the LOC GS and FD blanked on both sides of the aircraft on autopilot A. We successfully completed the go around and returned to autopilot A as the navigation equipment came back and identified after reset.The approach that followed had the exact same blanking of all NAV data at 500 until the ground; this time hand flying and under visual conditions. We queried ATC and were the only ones who reported an issue. We wrote up the LOC GS sensing in the Electronic Logbook (ELB) and switched aircraft. I followed up [later] and it appeared my write up was released under MEL for the autopilot A; which never failed or was written up by us. I called Maintenance Control to query him on the decision and he agreed it did not sound like an autopilot issue based on my write up and our conversation. I also briefed the crew on the issue on our arrival to ORD. The maintenance controller said he would follow up with an inflight uplink to make the crew aware.My concern rested with the; in my opinion; incorrect diagnosis and remedy to the approach navaid sensing issue; and the repeated issue occurring in the future if it happened to another crew during another similar situation on approach low to the terrain. Especially with the new; descent checklist and arrival flows; increased weather and the go around simultaneously happening the same time; this issue needed more attention than I feel it received.,B737 Captain reported the localizer; glideslope; and flight director blanked on both sides during approach.

Soon after; we were given best rate through 12;000. Upon passing 10;000; I set a speed restriction of 250/12000 in FMC; selected Econ; and due to the 120-cost index; per the Release; lowered the climb speed to 320kts from 335kts. Eventually we were given a climb to somewhere in the upper 20s. Next came a clearance to climb to a higher altitude in the lower 30s. At around 27;000ft; I noticed the autopilot starting to chase the speed and was doing small vertical oscillations in the attempt. I made a comment to my First Office (FO) about the autopilot having issues. Knowing the 737 has a few issues with VNAV; it wasn't anything more than slightly unusual at this time. These oscillations continued to get more extreme. I told FO that I was going to switch the Vertical mode from VNAV to FLCH (Flight Level Change). After doing this; the oscillations didn't get any better. I then told him I was going to try V/S; assuming if I could get the aircraft to stop chasing the speed the oscillations would go away. With no relief in sight; I then told FO; 'I can't take this anymore; I'm turning the autopilot off;' expecting full well for everything to be fine and blaming the whole thing on a quirky autopilot. As soon as I turned the autopilot off; I discovered that I could barely move the yoke forward and back. As FO would later say; it was like pushing the yoke through wet; soon to be dry; concrete. At first I thought; this can't be; it must be me. I told him I can't move the elevator; you try. He couldn't move it with any effectiveness either. With further force; and being as gentle as we could; we could move it; but with minimal effect. It felt like manual reversion in the simulators that I have done many times; but with slightly less effect. At this point; I checked the roll and yaw axis and everything felt normal. I didn't push the rudder too much either way; as I wasn't sure what was going on with the tail on this airplane. We also determined that the stabilizer trim was working as normal; which became our primary way to control our vertical axis. As soon as we determined we had this flight control issue; we notified ATC as an emergency. We were equal distance from ZZZ and ZZZ1; with ZZZ1 being on the nose and ZZZ behind us. We asked ATC what the runway length and winds were in ZZZ1. Knowing that ZZZ1 would have big; long; and wide runways. ATC informed us that the runway that lined up with the 8kt wind was over 12000ft. We informed ATC that's where we wanted to go. During this entire time; we never had any indication of anything being wrong with the aircraft except from physically struggling to move the elevator. Hydraulic quantity and pressure were normal. I then asked FO to find me a checklist in the QRH that had something to do with what was going on. The only checklist he could find was the manual reversion checklist; which related to hydraulic pressure or quantity loss. I asked him to look at every flight control cover and switch and make sure they were all in their normal positions. He assured me everything was where it should be. We then inquired as to the winds in ZZZ as I knew it would be much easier to handle the passengers. ATC advised us that the winds were gusting up to 30kts. ZZZ1 was our final decision. At this time; I asked FO to talk to the flight attendants and inform them of our situation. I asked him to give them the full briefing and prepare for possible evacuation on the runway. Soon after the event started; we slowly bleed off speed and descend. Not wanting to make any abrupt changes; we slowly reduced the speed to 250kts. I noticed as the speed decreased we would gain a little bit of elevator authority. I asked FO to take the aircraft while I made a short Public Address to the passengers. After taking controls back; I asked FO to ask ATC to notify the company as the 737 is not sat phone equipped; and making any attempt at this point to talk to company and maintenance would be a long process and I couldn't afford to be without the FO. We asked ATC for the ILS frequency and were informed that the 12000 ft. runway didn't have an ILS only the 9600 ft. runway. With only a 4 or 5kt crosswind; and very much needing vertical guidance; we decided to switch to runway 9600 ft. at ZZZ1. We then asked for the ILS frequency; course; and FAF name. We extended our centerline off the FAF to give us better situational awareness as we didn't have any charts to look at. It was daylight and 'clear and a million.' We informed ATC that we needed a 20-mile straight in to work through this problem. I wanted to check the aircraft state in every configuration and feel how it was responding at these different settings.The flight attendants called us back at some point and told us that the cabin was prepared. We relayed all pertinent information to ATC and requested Crew Fire Rescue to be standing by. There was not a whole lot of briefing the norms for FO and I as we had no approach charts and were committed to the landing. It was briefed that I may need him at anytime; and especially in the flare; to help with the flight controls. We were under landing weight and FO referenced the QRH landing data. We selected max brakes as a precaution. We received our long final and slowly configured the airplane. After each flap setting and subsequent speed reduction; the elevator became easier to use. It was based on this that I wanted to use a flaps 30 landing and a lack of familiarity with flaps 40 from reducing the speed further. After final configuration with flaps 30; I decided that I had enough elevator movement to make a safe landing without the need for the brace command. Upon reaching the flare; I asked FO to help me pull back as the flight controls were extremely heavy. We made a somewhat 'normal' touchdown based on the circumstances. Auto brakes kicked in and acted normal. As I disengaged the autobrakes at a slow speed; the brakes felt like they barely worked. I asked FO to feel them once when we had slowed to around 5kts and he agreed. We stopped the aircraft in the middle of [the] Runway. The fire chief did a visual inspection of the aircraft and gave us a thumbs up. Initially we were trying to coordinate a tow to the apron; but informed ATC we were going to try a very slow taxi and if we had any problems would need to be towed. We proceeded to taxi very slowly and check the brakes immediately to ensure their usability. We then taxied to a passenger area and parked the aircraft. Once at the gate; I made another brief Public Address and asked FO to please check on passengers and flight attendants. One extremely important note is that when we first got to the airplane; we were soon greeted by a mechanic asking us if everything was okay. We stated that we had just got there and hadn't had time to look around. He then noticed that the left hydraulic quantity was at 106 and the right at 80. He asked if we wanted him to transfer hydraulic fluid; we said sure. For 5 minutes; he was transferring without the left side going down at all but the right side was going up. I asked how that was possible and he said the gauge only goes to 106 and it was 'way over filled.' It took him over 10 minutes to balance the levels with the right ending up around 98 and the left around 100. It may be completely coincidental that a mechanic is working on our hydraulic system and an hour later; we have a major problem with the elevator. It almost felt like air was in the elevator hydraulic line instead of fluid.,B737NG flight crew reported difficulty moving the elevator controls during climbout; consequently diverting and landing in emergency condition.

Engine instruments indicated that the left engine was at climb thrust but that the right engine had rolled back to idle. The ECAM directed the engine 2 throttle be retarded to idle; and the A/TH KEEP ON. The LAND ASAP indication was displayed.We requested a level off at FL240 with ATC. After completing the ECAM we [advised ATC] and requested vectors to [departure airport]. We were approximately 60 miles from the field. We sent an ACARS message to Dispatch informing that we had the engine 2 locked in idle; were return to base; and requested landing data. We were approximately 152;000 landing weight; 10;000 over maximum. I elected to fly. Uneventful single engine approach and landing.,A320 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after the #2 engine locked into idle thrust during climb.

About that time the cabin crew called up and said that they smelled an electrical burning. Captain asked if the oven was on and they replied no. At this point we [advised ATC] and started to turn back towards [departure airport]. The Captain ran the QRH checklist for fumes/smoke. At the same time I was flying the airplane and working the radios. We followed QRH procedures and landed with no issues. Crash fire was there to look over the airplane once off the runway.,B737-800 First Officer reported experiencing fumes of an unknown electrical source; both in the cockpit and cabin. After the appropriate checklists were completed the flight successfully diverted to a nearby suitable airport.

With no warning; the engine rumbled for a couple of seconds with an obvious felt vibration and then after a slight pop the N1 of the right engine rolled back to around 30%. At the same time the EGT started to climb and would not respond to retarding the thrust lever. The EGT eventually reached 742 degrees before we could complete the Engine Fire/Severe Damage QRH. I elected to use that QRH due to the initial vibration and the temperature in the red zone. It was First Officer (FO) leg to fly and he assumed control of the aircraft immediately and smoothly; as well as taking the primary radio; while I began to run checklists and coordinate. ATC immediately offered [a diversion airport] as an option after we called in as an engine-out emergency. After running the checklist; securing the engine and beginning our driftdown; I began to attempt to contact company. I initially tried to call ops; but quickly realized we were too far away. My next choice was ARINC. At first I could get no response on the center VHF radio; so I shifted to the right radio. On that radio I was able to hear a long conversation in progress between Medlink and another aircraft. Not being able to contact dispatch; and having decided [the diversion airport] was near and suitable; I decided that managing the immediate situation was more important. We set up and briefed the approach during a long slow descent. We felt that rushing was not warranted; though we didn't waste time either. ATC was very helpful in coordinating the response from [emergency services] as well as facilitating our arrival to the airport. I tried one more time to contact company through ARINC to coordinate with dispatch but was unable to get a reply. Center then gave us vectors to the ILS and we shot the visual approach to 23L. During the vectors; I realized that ATC probably had a way of contacting Operations; and they said that they had an emergency number on our ATC strip. I agreed that would be the best number to call; and ATC came back and verified that company was aware of our situation and diversion.FO did a great job flying the airplane and at no time did I even remotely feel that I should take over flying. My time was best spent supporting him and coordinating with all the various parties involved. Also; our jumpseater was [another] Captain and even though we didn't need him to take an active part; I was very glad to have him along as an extra set of eyes and ears just in case. All in all; once we got settled down; training showed and the overall mood was surprisingly relaxed even though we were all undoubtedly thinking; 'I can't believe this just happened.' FO landed the plane just as nicely as you could wish and we proceeded to taxi to a ramp.After all that; the phone calls began; and after consulting with Ops; Maintenance; and Dispatch; we shut the plane down and departed for FBO and then the hotel.,B767 flight crew reported experiencing a failure of the right (Number 2) engine while at cruise altitude.

She notified me that a passenger window had cracked and the passengers had relocated seats. We stopped the climb at FL330. At that point; I think our altitude did not capture and went down to FL326. The Captain started a phone patch with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The A Flight Attendant took a picture and slid it under the flight deck door. Unable to determine the severity of the crack; the Captain went back to assess the damage. Upon return; he told me that he could hear wind through the window. He shared that information with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Over the radio; he was in constant communication with ATC that we were working an issue.At no point did I request priority handling or [advise ATC]. Once the decision was made by Dispatch to divert; I requested the diversion with a precautionary landing into ZZZ1. Tower asked if we needed assistance; we declined. Normal approach with gusty winds. Our speed went plus 10 above target. The Captain (Pilot Monitoring) announced correction on speed. I called airspeed; and said the gust was varying the speed +10/-5 of target. Normal landing; rollout and taxi to the gate.,B737-700 First Officer reported a cracked passenger window in flight.

I stopped our climb to minimize the cabin differential pressure and leveled off at 33;000 feet. I asked the Flight Attendant several questions to confirm that it was the glass outer pane that was damaged; and not the plastic inside pane. She confirmed that it was the glass pane that was cracked. I descended down to 27;000 feet because it was smoother air at 270; and this would also reduce the differential pressure.We remained pressurized during the entire event. We were near ZZZ; so we called ZZZ Operations to establish communication with Dispatch and Maintenance. Talking to Maintenance; he asked if I'd seen the damage. I hadn't yet; so I went back in the cabin to assess the damage. The outer glass pane was definitely cracked; and this window had significantly more wind noise coming from it. I returned to the flight deck with the information and agreed with Dispatch that we should divert. We diverted uneventfully into ZZZ.The Flight Attendants reported that some of the passengers were scared and concerned. Upon arrival at the gate; one passenger collapsed to her knees in the jetway; and was quickly met by paramedics. She continued on with us after we swapped aircraft. I made a logbook entry for the cracked window and left the aircraft with ZZZ Contract Maintenance.,B737-700 Captain reported a passenger window outer pane cracked in flight.

On final approach to BUR Runway 8; with the gear down; ATC pointed out VFR traffic at our 2 o'clock position. I never saw the traffic that I believe was landing northbound at VNY. I don't remember the specific TCAS RA; but it required me to at least level off or climb. We executed the published missed approach. ATC offered us an approach to Runway 15; but I declined since we hadn't briefed it; and I know there are some terrain considerations that I didn't have time to fully consider and brief.After our checklists were complete for our second approach to Runway 8; I made a quick Public Address to our Customers. The next approach was a repeat of the first. This time; however; I know it was a 'Monitor Vertical Speed' requiring me to at least level off. Because the gear was down; we executed another missed approach. I will admit I really didn't want to execute the second missed approach as I considered the RA a nuisance alert; considering we knew where the traffic was and I know the First Officer had him in sight for the second approach (and I think the first as well). After the last RA ceased; I had complied with the RA vertical guidance; but hadn't commanded landing gear up yet. I was two-dots high and had some space to try to salvage the approach; but quickly decided this is the worst place to try to salvage a high approach; and executed another missed approach.There was no VNY traffic on our third approach. Dispatch had us planned to land with 11;000 pounds of fuel in BUR. I am very thankful we weren't planned to land with 5;000. Also; I would appreciate some clarification on the QRH's Response to other than a 'Monitor' or 'Maintain' (except a Climb RA in landing configuration) on page 1.9. We were not in flaps 40 configuration in either event; but the gear was down on both. Is landing configuration final flap setting; or gear down? Is a 'monitor vertical speed' that commands a level off considered a climb? Because we had excess fuel to work with; the missed approaches were clearly the least risk and I believe procedurally correct thing to do; but it certainly felt like a circus.,B737 Captain reported receiving TCAS RAs while flying approaches to Runway 08 at BUR from northbound landing traffic at VNY.

I had the first break and left my duty station after passing FL180. (The Relief First Officer) took over my duties and responsibilities at that point until the conclusion of the event. The event happened prior to ZZZZZ climbing from FL360 to FL380. I was on break when I heard a loud bang and a strong vibration coming from the left engine. I looked out the window to look for any signs of damage or visual indications of fire. Everything looked normal. The flight attendants came to get my attention and I proceeded back to the flight deck. The affected engine was the left engine and it was back near idle when I entered the cockpit. I began to run the Engine Limit or Surge or Stall Checklist while the Captain and FO handled the flying and talking on the radios. The engine indications appeared normal but for the excessive vibrations and was left at idle until the final approach segment [back at the departure airport]. ATC was notified by Captain; and FO flew the approach and landing. Landing was uneventful and ARFF said there nothing out of the ordinary. Thrust reverser worked properly. We taxied back to the gate and shut down normally. The passengers deplaned and we lived to fight another day. After talking to maintenance and seeing the images that they sent to us. It was clear that the nose cone had an area that broke off due to stress fatigue and was ingested into the outer fan section. The acoustic panels and fan blade had noticeable damage.,B767 flight crew reported a left engine compressor stall during climb.

Immediately a strong odor and fumes came from the forward vents; causing brief dizziness. Both pilots donned O2 masks; requested descent and turned back to ZZZ. I took the controls and the FO (First Officer) started QRH procedure for smoke/fumes in cockpit. The Lead FA called and reported the noise and fumes and also slight dizziness. I directed a cabin prep for immediate return with a normal landing and no evacuation. As we completed the QRH and assessed the aircraft; we set up for a visual approach to Runway XXC with ILS back up. No smoke was observed. On landing we had Fire Team do a visual assessment of the aircraft with emphasis on the avionics bay. No smoke or fire detected. Taxied to gate with masks on; was met by Fire/EMT who did an air quality check; then evaluation of the aircrew. All ok. Consulted with maintenance; who were able to hear the same noises from avionics bay; and noted a popped breaker for one of the vents. Wrote up log book; checked on passengers and crew and all ok.,A321 Captain reported a loud noise and vibration during climbout followed by smoke and fumes emanating from the forward vents.

The Pilot Flying; Captain; stated we need to contact ATC and ask for an immediate descent to [a nearby airport]. The Captain donned his O2 mask in the event smoke or fumes reached the flight deck. I; Pilot Monitoring; contacted ATC for a lower altitude. I donned my O2 mask. We ran the QRH for an emergency descent as well as smoke; fire or fumes. In the descent; the FA attempted to contact us; but we were busy getting the aircraft on the ground. We landed; I contacted the FA's to see if there still smoke or fumes. They stated that no smoke or fumes were noted. We cleared the runway and waited for fire personnel to verify no flames or fire was being observed. They stated all was clear. We taxied to the gate. I realized I hadn't set a lower landing altitude for [the airport we landed at]; so the cabin pressure was still set for [the destination airport]. The Fire Department boarded the aircraft and could not find a source of the smoke/fumes.I believe we as a crew handled this inflight emergency very well. The Captain did an excellent job maintaining aircraft control. Due to the time constraints of dealing with a fire or fumes; I did not get a chance to respond to the FA's during the descent and landing; but I did contact them after we landed. I should have at least contacted them for a brief update as to what was happening in the cabin. Another issue I had was related to the having the O2 mask on; running the correct QRH as well as the radios in a timely manner; which lead me to missing the correct position of the outflow valve and cabin altitude.,B737 First Officer reported diverting to a nearby airport after being notified of smoke/fumes in the cabin by the Flight Attendants.

Our Cabin Altitude Indicator read 10;000 feet and our Rate Indicator was climbing at approximately 300 FPM. We also received a status message Auto 1 inoperative and Auto 2 inoperative. We also had an intermittent AUTO Inoperative light on our Cabin Altitude Control Panel which indicates AUTO 1 and AUTO 2 cabin altitude control functions are inoperative. We immediately donned our oxygen masks and I [advised ATC] requesting direct to our closest alternate. I advised the flight attendants over the PA of our impending descent. The cabin altitude never went past 12;000 feet and held steady during most of our descent at 10;000 feet. No masks dropped in the cabin as our altitude never reached 14;000 feet. I was conducting IOE and my other two FOs (First Officers) returned to the cockpit while we were passing through 28;000 feet. I designated my FO to continue being the PF (Pilot Flying) and to handle ATC communications. I assigned both IRO pilots various tasks to help ensure that all QRH procedures and [Operations Manual] Diversion Guides were followed. We advised ATC prior to dumping fuel. We dumped approximately 9;000 LBS of fuel at an altitude of 8;000 feet over land in close proximity of [our alternate]. We ran the QRH Overweight Landing checklist and landed at 371;920 LBS. We consulted with Dispatch via ACARS and SAT phone prior to landing. We coordinated with the Lead Flight Attendant. I took over as PF once we were ready to brief the approach while [in] holding. An uneventful soft landing in the TDZE was accomplished using MAX REVERSE and AUTO BRAKES 3. REF 155 TARGET 160 and brake temps all remained solid white and held below 2.0. After emergency vehicles verified no smoke coming from our main gear we taxied to [our gate]. Paramedics met the aircraft. It was while we were deplaning that I learned of one passenger had requested to meet with paramedics with a complaint of pain in her left ear.All crew members; especially my 3 FOs and Lead Flight Attendant did an outstanding job following SOPs and CRM/TEM (Crew Resource Management; Threat Error Management) procedures. The professionalism of my crew came through during the [event] and we all recalled how it was just in last year's [currency training] that we practiced Rapid Depressurization and the Emergency Descent procedure. All passenger comments as they were exiting the aircraft were thankful and complimentary. I debriefed the entire crew together as a group prior to leaving for the hotel. I'd also like to thank [our Operations Manager] for his assistance.,B767 flight crew reported a loss of cabin pressure; resulting in a diversion to a nearby suitable airport.

The 2 FAs in rear did not notice a smell. I asked them to come to the forward part of the cabin to check for odor. All 4 FAs confirmed an odor. I left the flight deck to check the odor. As soon as I stepped out I noticed a very strong musty; moldy noxious odor. When I returned to the cockpit I immediately turn off PACK 1. I instructed the FO (First Officer) and the FA in the cockpit to don oxygen mask. I included the FA so that she wouldn't go nose blind and I could send her out to evaluate any change to the fumes/odors. Then I started the 'elimination of fume' checklist. After ~5 minutes there was no notable fume reduction. I switched PACK 1 ON and PACK 2 OFF. After 3-5 minutes the FA reported the fumes/odors got worse. I switched back to the first PACK configuration and we begin a descent to [a nearby alternate airport]. At around 7000 feet there was a very strong choking fume in the cockpit. I switched all PACKs off and open the RAM air inlet. Shortly after the plane depressurized; the air in cockpit was markedly better. We landed and taxied to the gate without further incident. Upon my request; paramedics met us at the gate. We made an announcement if anyone needed to see paramedics to raise their hand. One gentleman was removed and later taken to the hospital. All crew had various symptoms: headache; dizziness; nausea; shortness of breath; and sore throat. We went to ER for testing and evaluation. We were discharged after 6 hours elapsed; as directed by the ER staff and Poison Control.,A320 Captain reported reported noxious fumes in the cabin and cockpit resulted in a diversion.

Soon after; the right engine vibrated continuously and EGT began to rise. We pulled throttle to idle. The EGT still rose to above 660 so we shut down right engine and ran appropriate QRH. We [notified ATC] and continued the arrival to [our destination]. The QRH directed to attempt an engine restart which we did so successfully. However; upon advancing the right throttle past idle the vibration returned; hence we kept the throttle at idle and landed single engine. Then taxied to gate. The aforementioned vibration felt like an engine compression stall; also flames were seen shooting out the right engine.,B767 First Officer reported a vibration in the right engine resulting in an engine shutdown.

The aircraft yawed and rolled right slightly. The right EGT rose and the right N2 showed no rotation; the vibration indicator showed high vibration. The Captain indicated to ATC that we wanted vectors for immediate return. We referenced and followed QRH which led to a right engine shutdown. We were vectored for an ILS. We landed at flaps 20 without incident. Due to the landing weight and reference to QRH we cleared the runway and waited for the fire department to monitor the brakes and tires for overheating.,B767 flying First Officer and IRO reported returning to their international departure airport after the #2 engine failed climbing through 13;000 feet.

The FA (Flight Attendant) immediately called up asking if we heard the sound and to state 'the cabin is filling with a white mist.' Without an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor); we immediately shut down PACK 2 per the [company's] Fumes procedure. The FA called back up stating the mist was dissipating but that the rear FA smelled smoke that correlated with a burning wire aroma. We [advised ATC] and initiated a diversion to ZZZ.Upon landing in ZZZ; crash and fire rescue inspected the aircraft and found no heat signatures. We taxied to the gate and subsequently deplaned. ZZZ maintenance found the PACK 2 ACM to have seized up.,A319 First Officer reported that after hearing and feeling a loud rumble in the cockpit; the cabin started filling up with white smoke.

Number 2 called back to Number 3 to ask how she was feeling; she mentioned she had a major headache and felt faint. This information was provided to Captain and First 0fficer as a precaution by Number 1. After some discussion; Captain asked that all three Flight Attendants go to back of cabin; go on oxygen tanks; and stay in back. We stayed on 0xygen until 25 minutes prior to landing; when we were asked to clear the cabin and prepare early. During this time; the Captain told Number 2 that he was turning OFF the Number 1 AC Pack and to advise of any smells. Number 1 and Number 2 identified a 'hot oil'; 'hot metallic' smell between Rows 5-8 and advised the Captain. No smoke was ever visible and no 'dirty sox' smell was ever observed.Throughout the administration of oxygen and from the beginning of the incident; none of the three of the Flight Attendants felt any better and actually felt worse as time continued. After deplaning; all Flight Attendants and the Captain were examined by EMS and Number 2 was transported to Hospital by EMS; and later released. Three days later; Number 2 Flight Attendant is still having major health issues and has seen three doctors.,A320 Flight Attendant reported the cabin crew experienced physical illnesses; after noticing a 'hot oil; metallic smell' in the cabin.

We were climbing in LNAV and VNAV. At 15;000 feet we noticed a burning smell before the Number 2 transfer bus 'Off' light illuminated (generator tripped off). I stated to the First Officer to don his oxygen mask. The flight attendants rang four times. They stated they noticed an odor in the cabin. I stated to the Flight Attendants we would be returning to [the departure airport]. The First Officer lost some flight instruments and gave the aircraft to me. I [advised ATC]. I gave the aircraft back to the First Officer as the situation was realized that it was the generator tripping.I ran the Transfer Off Bus IT Checklist. As I was reading the checklist it called for turning on the APU and restoring the Number 2 transfer bus. I stopped there because I did not want to restore power to a problem. I ran a [Diversion] Checklist. I notified ATC; stating that after landing we needed to go to a disbursement area and deplane using two portable stairs. Also; I requested the fire equipment and personnel.I re-contacted the Flight Attendants and asked how they were and told them we would be on the ground in 10 minutes or less. Then we would taxi to an area very close to the runway. Lastly; we would deplane the passengers via two air stairs; one would pull up at the aft entry and the other the forward entry door. The generator drive light illuminated. I coordinated with Station Operations and Dispatch on the Company frequency. I stated our intentions. I made three announcements to the passengers on the way back to [the departure airport]. The flight attendants; ATC; passengers; Company Operations and Dispatch were notified about our plan.We landed on XXR and made a right turn off the runway. I elected to make a right turn so we were not wedged between two runways. Then I made another right while the APU was starting because I wanted the passengers to leave the aircraft in a safe direction. Once the APU was online I configured for evacuation and shutdown the engines. My First Officer got up to help with the evacuation. I established communication with the Fire Chief. I stated that we wanted the stairs. He stated they only have one set of stairs and it was pulling up to the forward entry door. I made a PA to the passengers that we would be off the aircraft very soon and to follow directions on the ground. Also; I stated to the Flight Attendants to disarm the forward entry door.The Number 2 engine control light illuminated after engine shutdown. The passengers deplaned via stairs and left their luggage on the aircraft. The passengers boarded buses returned to the terminal and were reunited with their bags. The aircraft was de-powered and towed to [the gate]. The passengers departed to [their destination]. One person with asthma discussed their situation with a Paramedic but refused to go to the hospital. A logbook entry was made.,B737NG flight crew reported observing caution lights and odors associated with an electrical system anomaly; which necessitated an immediate return to the departure airport; and a passenger evacuation via air stairs.
1557670,201807,0001-0600,US,Air Carrier,Passenger,B737 Next Generation Undifferentiated,Cruise,Powerplant Lubrication System,Captain; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP); Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Multiengine,Workload; Time Pressure; Situational Awareness; Distraction,Aircraft Equipment Problem Critical; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance,Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Flight Crew Landed in Emergency Condition; Flight Crew Diverted; Flight Crew Inflight Shutdown; General Maintenance Action,Aircraft; Airport,Aircraft,We received a call from the cabin that they and some passengers had witnessed sparks coming from the left engine and then stopping. We noticed engine indications were in the normal range but oil quantity was lower than previous and oil pressure; while in normal range; was less than the right engine. The engine seemed to be operating well at that time.Got in touch with dispatch and asked if he could find out if Maintenance Control was able to see any down-linked engine events. Maybe that would show something irregular around the time of the witnessed event. They couldn't. We were then patched to Dispatch and Maintenance Control on Commercial Radio and verbally talked to them. We were advised by Maintenance Control that there was no low limit to oil quantity and it could go to ZERO but we didn't have to shut the engine down until oil pressure was at the 'magic number' of 13 PSI. We continued monitoring oil quantity and saw that it was slowly getting lower. The consensus was to continue on our route and monitor the engine.We had decided on a few alternate airports on our flight path to use as diversion airports should the time come that an engine shutdown was necessary. During this time we had been reviewing all pertinent procedures we would need if/when the engine needed to be shutdown while also discussing the situation in general.Approaching ZZZ it was becoming apparent that the rate of oil loss would not allow us to continue to ZZZ1. ZZZ2 was suggested but that was too far to be considered nearest suitable airport. It was decided that ZZZ would be our diversion airport as there was a plane available and closest to us with personnel there to assist. Flight attendants were briefed and passengers were made aware of the precautionary nature; at that time; of our diversion.FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying) at this time and made arrangements to go to ZZZ3 initially in a brief error in communication. I noticed this and we confirmed with the Dispatcher's message that ZZZ was our airport and we corrected our destination with Center. At some point during the decent the oil quantity went to ZERO. Oil pressure was fluctuating between 22-28 PSI. The APU was also started to save time if we were to need it. We had set up for Runway 02C and had previously run non normal landing calculations in the event we did approach on a single engine.I had resumed PF duties and shallowed our decent for two reasons. First; we were still 40 miles from ZZZ and second I wanted to add thrust to see where the oil pressure would be before we leveled off closer to the airport. FO brought up the idea to review the procedure for a failure while on short final to the runway. That procedure was reviewed. About 10 miles from the runway the oil pressure started to flash red at 13 PSI and we decided it was time to secure the left engine. [Advised ATC] at this time. FO did a very good job performing the checklist while I continued toward the runway. All was complete and configured by the time we turned final at the glide slope intercept. Approach resulted in an uneventful landing. ARFF was there to look over the plane and with no concerns we then proceed to the gate.After plane was secured at the gate I had made calls to the dispatcher who ended up being a different one who we had been coordinating with. The Chief Pilot called and discussion about flying the other plane to ZZZ1 was initiated. The FO and I answered the Human Factors questions he asked. I was unaware that it was fairly standard practice to remove the crew from all subsequent flying after an even like this. FO had that understanding but I wasn't getting the message he was trying to get across to me.After getting off this call I received a call from the Chief Pilot who essentially did the right thing and removed us from the ZZZ1 flight we thought we were OK to do. His judgment was correct that in hindsight I was not in the state I believed to be in and rest not more flying was the best call. This was apparent the further away I got from this situation.Then another call from the Crew Coordinator and he had us flying the crew's (who had flown the other plane into ZZZ) remaining schedule which would have extended us 2 days beyond our trip. This was contested and amended to have us layover in ZZZ.After all this I received a call from Maintenance Control who wanted some more details about the engine parameters before and after shutdown to help assess the course of maintenance. He mentioned he did not see an ELB (Electronic Logbook) report yet and that he would put it in for me since I had TOTALLY FORGOT due to the multiple distractions I created by making a phone call before report the mechanical issue.Overall CRM (Crew Resource Management) made this event 'uneventful'. Flight attendants; Company Communications System and pilots sharing information and ideas and making decisions based on all resources available to us. Synergy on the flight deck was apparent as between the two of us a comprehensive plan was made and executed with little to no (apparent) stress.,B737 Captain reported an engine oil system anomaly which resulted in an engine shutdown; and a successful diversion to a suitable alternate airport.

We performed the 'Elimination Of Odors In The Cockpit/Cabin' checklist; but limited the procedure to the aft cabin/Pack 2 portion of the procedure due to the fact that both the Captain and myself could smell no odor; nor were suffering from any physical/physiological effects.After completing the checklist items; we again established communication with the Flight Attendants and discovered that both the smell; as well as physical/physiological symptoms that they were experiencing; as well as the 'Dirty Sock' smell persisted; we decided to LAND ASAP and ZZZ was selected (with concurrence from Dispatch) as the nearest suitable diversion airport.After briefing the Flight Attendants and Passengers; we diverted to ZZZ and an overweight landing checklist was performed as we were approximately 8000-9000 LBS. over max landing weight. Tower and ground were advised to have EMS meet us at the gate to assist with Flight Attendant and Passenger medical evaluation as needed. Touchdown was smooth and later determined to be well within limits by maintenance. To my knowledge; only one passenger complained of feeling ill; but declined medical treatment; however; all four Flight Attendants complained of feeling nauseous; burning eyes; and dizziness. One flight attendant was observed vomiting in the rear lavatory. After all Flight Attendants were checked at the gate by medical personnel/EMS; they were transported to a nearby medical clinic where it was later learned they had all been diagnosed with Carbon Monoxide Poisoning-with severity ranging from mild to serious. All Flight Attendants as well as Captain performed admirably and professionally during this emergency. All crew members worked together to attain the best possible outcome from unfavorable circumstances that we were presented with yesterday and I have nothing but praise and accolades for our crew.,A320 flight crew reported diverting after all four flight attendants noted a dirty sock smell in the aft galley area during climb.

Engine 2 EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) was in excess of 900 C. We were unable to reduce Engine 2 EGT with the thrust lever so we shut the engine down.Approach provided vectors for a return to Runway XXR (Visual Approach) normal landing. After the aircraft was stopped on the runway emergency equipment inspected the aircraft for damage and none was observed.,A321 First Officer reported shutting engine 2 down while in climb due to excessive EGT; resulting in them returning to their departure airport.

Shortly thereafter; I saw the balloon directly on our path and at our altitude. I immediately turned 20 degrees right and continued our descent. We immediately told ATC we were deviating to avoid balloon traffic. By the time we were abeam the balloon we were well below it. Unfortunately; neither us or ATC knew if the balloon was tethered. When we were done deviating; ATC cleared back on route. No loss of separation was encountered to the best of my knowledge. While on final approach; we encountered another hot air balloon. We were on final at 1000 feet. We saw a balloon at our altitude just to the right of course. ATC didn't seem to be aware of this balloon. We notified ATC of the traffic. No deviation was necessary. We made a normal landing.,B767 flight crew reported taking evasive action while on approach to Sao Paulo to avoid a hot air balloon.

It sounded as though something had struck the aircraft from outside. All engine instruments read normal and there was no airframe vibration so we pressed on to ZZZ1. On arriving into ZZZ1 during the approach I as the pilot flying called for 'gear down.' There was another violent jolt and we received a GEAR DISAGREE warning and proceeded to do a go-around. During the go-around I used the standard go around callouts and called for 'Gear up.' As soon as I called for the gear up I mentioned to the FO (First Officer) that 'no; we should leave the gear down' but it was too late as he immediately had raised the gear and we felt another violent jolt. ATC climbed us to 5;000 feet where I handed the aircraft to the FO so that I could run the QRH. I ran the QRH and it called for Landing Gear Lever down and Accomplish Normal Landing. The GEAR DISAGREE light extinguished but it was here I noted the R SIDE BRACE light illuminated. I quickly ran thru the (R) SIDE BRACE QRH but was becoming concerned about the fuel remaining as we were down to 6;000 pounds at this point. I instructed the FO we needed to get the aircraft on the ground and initiate the approach with ATC. The FO was still flying the aircraft and handling communications with ATC. I made a quick call to the Flight Attendant Lead and also a brief PA to the passengers explaining the gear problem. ATC had us fly over ZZZ2 Tower and they reported all gear appeared down. We proceeded to land in ZZZ1. Landing was normal but as I was unsure of the status of the gear I informed Tower that we were disabled on the runway.Later I was told that I did not give the Flight Attendants sufficient time to prepare the cabin and that I did not give the 'Brace' signal before landing. I did call and inform the Flight Attendants after the Go Around of our current gear condition after we leveled at 5;000 feet and before attempting to call dispatch. I attempted numerous contacts with Dispatch via Satcom; Telephone; and VHF radio. I answered numerous calls from various Flight Attendants via intercom to the cockpit while attempting to run the QRH. Finally; after noting our fuel quantity at 6;000 pounds and knowing we were to initially land with 10;600 pounds I was focused on getting the aircraft on the ground. I spoke with the lead Flight Attendant and informed her we were beginning our approach.,B767 Captain reported that each time the gear was raised or lowered there was a loud bang and a strong jolt.

As I pondered my next move the First Officer asked if I smelled that; followed shortly by I think that is the dirty sock smell. Her next comment of 'I'm already feeling nauseated' broke my reverie and both crew members as well as our jump seat occupant donned O2 masks immediately. We attempted to perform the 'Elimination of odor in the flight deck/cabin' procedure. We were hindered in our efforts by the fact that the binder of the first QRH employed broke in half when the First Officer attempted to retrieve it leaving her with nearly 200 loose pages of former QRH. I provided my QRH but the procedure is missing from the back; or anywhere; in this particular aircraft's QRH. Volume 2 was referenced for the procedure which was challenging to find given the constraints of the mask.We leveled the aircraft at 16;000 feet and as the First Officer was already experiencing symptoms I elected to return the aircraft to [the departure airport] without further delay. ATC was notified of our intentions and I terminated the previously mentioned checklist that involved troubleshooting the air packs due to the difficulty in following a procedure through the mask on the Ipad and our need to prepare the aircraft for an air turn back. I never did feel I was able to get a real idea of which pack might be causing the odor. As we descended through 10;000 feet I turned off BOTH packs since I had been unable to determine the source of the odor and opened the ram air valve in an effort to provide as much fresh air to the cabin as possible. The First Officer ran the overweight landing checklist as we were approximately 3000 pounds above max landing weight. ATC vectored us for an ILS Approach which terminated in a successful landing. The aircraft was met by Fire and EMS as well as representatives from flight operations; inflight and local [authorities].The aircraft was deplaned without further incident. The odor event; crew usage of O2 and overweight landing were documented in the logbook post flight. The flight and cabin crew debriefed with the aforementioned parties prior to departing the scene. Both the Airbus and [company] odor/fume reporting sheets were completed and delivered to maintenance. Both pilots and I believe all flight attendants reported to company provided medical care for evaluation afterwards. On further communication with flight attendants it appears at least some of them showed elevated levels of carbon monoxide in the blood tests their doctors performed. Even though the doctor was familiar with these ongoing odor events in the industry and was provided with [union] and IATA guidance for examination no blood testing of the pilots was completed. Perhaps the company [and other parties involved] can work towards a common strategy for post incident comprehensive physical examination of crew members to ensure all bases are covered.Ensure that the Elimination of Odor in Flight Deck/Cabin checklist is added to EVERY QRH in the fleet ASAP. I believe our fleet manager has been working very hard to see this happen. Trying to use an Ipad to find critical checklists while wearing a mask is very difficult even without the presence of visibility restricting particulates in the air. Continue working on resolution to this seemingly complex issue as it appears to affect a large portion of the fleet including both Boeing and Airbus aircraft.,A320 flight crew reported odors in the cockpit requiring a return to the airport.

Maintenance was called. Maintenance found a broken piece of dish under the arming lever. After the piece was removed; the door was able to be armed; but the arming lever was more difficult than usual to move. Maintenance signed off the 1R door arming lever as operational and we departed. After takeoff; at about 500 feet the number 1 Flight Attendant called the flight deck and told us that he had a flashing cabin pressurization warning light. He was told to standby while the flight crew continued to fly and identify the problem. The 1R door armed light was found to be extinguished. The aircraft was leveled at 10;000 feet for analysis. After determining there was no issue with the aircraft pressurization system and that the problem was likely associated with the arming issue experienced at the gate; we elected to continue the flight as planned.The flight attendants were notified along with an explanation as to what was occurring. Approximately 10 minutes after leveling at cruise at 36000 feet; the number 1 Flight Attendant called to inform us that the other two flight attendants were experiencing symptoms of hypoxia. The cabin altitude at 36000 feet was approximately 7100 feet and holding stable with no adverse pressurization indications. A lower altitude of 24000 feet was immediately requested and obtained. After leveling at 24000 feet; the Captain checked on the flight attendants. The Captain was informed that their symptoms were worsening. We immediately [advised ATC].  The portable O2 bottles were used by each affected flight attendant; an onboard doctor began monitoring the situation; and the paramedics were requested to meet us at the gate. Upon arrival at the gate; their symptoms had subsided and the flight attendants reported fit for duty for their next leg. This event occurred due to an equipment failure in flight. If the door arming lever would not have changed status to 'disarmed' after takeoff; this event would not have occurred.I recommend informing both Maintenance and flight attendants that if a door arming lever is difficult to move after a slide replacement; even if the door is able to be armed; do not take the aircraft. The aircraft should be removed from service until the arming lever not only arms; but also moves with the normal amount of force application.,Air carrier flight crew reported a cabin pressure issue and flight attendants experiencing hypoxia.

All cockpit indications were normal. The non-flying pilot reviewed the QRH to look for an applicable procedure. The non-flying pilot reviewed the maintenance logbook for previous related write ups and found none. The non-flying pilot made frequent checks with the aft flight attendants every couple minutes to determine if the smell was getting stronger or dissipating and the flight attendants advised everything was the same; the faint smell was not improving or worsening. During the descent; the flight attendants called to report there was visible smoke coming from under the lavatory sink and they had switched off the water heater. Immediately; the non-flying pilot applied the SMOKE/FUMES/AVNCS Smoke Procedure; leading the pilots to turn off the COMM push button to deactivate the power to the lavatory and galleys; [and] continued to check with the aft flight attendants on the status of the smoke. They advised the smoke was not getting any worse. We continued to landing. At the gate; Maintenance determined the water heater to be faulty and placed the item on MEL. This was a faulty piece of equipment.,Air carrier flight crew reported smoke and fumes from the aft lavatory due to a faulty water heater.

We immediately followed the QRH procedure for Cabin/Cockpit fumes which resulted in us using oxygen and shutting off PACK 2. After PACK 2 was shutdown; fumes were reported to have dissipated. We consulted with Dispatch and made the joint determination it was safe to continue and we would advise of any changes.Near ZZZ; the flight attendants informed us of a musty; strong odor coming from the mid-cabin area. We again referenced the QRH checklist and consulted with Dispatch. The odors did not dissipate this time so we [advised ATC]; began an emergency descent; informed the flight attendants and passengers of the new flight plan; and prepared for landing into ZZZ. We used maximum forward speed under PIC (Pilot in Command) emergency authority towards ZZZ to minimize passenger and crew exposure to the fumes. We prepared the aircraft for an overweight landing by following the overweight landing QRH procedure and determined we had adequate performance for landing and go-around at our estimated landing weight of around 172700 lbs. We landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate. I made a PA to all passengers to expeditiously deplane the aircraft and to leave bags so they could get off as quickly as possible. For everyone's safety; it was paramount to get everyone off as quickly as possible. We contacted Dispatch about customs concerns but given the nature of the emergency it was not safe to leave anyone on the aircraft for any duration of time. After taking off my mask to exit the aircraft; I noticed the smell was noticeably strong in the cockpit and exited the aircraft expeditiously. The flight attendants were all suffering headaches and were checked out by EMS who met the aircraft.,A321 flight crew reported being advised of a dirty sock smell coming from the aft galley and then the mid cabin; resulting in a diversion.

During initial climb the fume began to get worse. Somewhere around 1000 feet I put my oxygen mask on and that is where I noticed a blue/gray fume/smoke coming from the vent above my oxygen mask case. Captain declared PAN PAN PAN and I took over communications as he began the QRH procedures. We landed back in [departure airport] and proceeded to the gate. Once passengers were off the aircraft I noticed I was not feeling well nor were the other crew members. EMT services were requested and the Captain and I were transported to the local hospital.,A319 pilot and flight attendant reported strong; incapacitating fumes in the cockpit and cabin immediately after takeoff; necessitating an immediate return to the departure airport.

We also had that flight's cabin crew deadheading back.Our flight was normal until descending through 14000 ft when a F/A (Flight Attendant) called to tell us that the same odor as the day before was back and a few of the crew and several passengers had noticed it. I told her we would be on the ground soon as by now we were coming up on 10000 ft AGL.I never noticed anything at any time on the flight but I started the Quick Action FUMES checklist. It was 110 degrees with a full flight and no APU so we hustled to [the] gate and shut down the engines. Just then a F/A called requesting an ambulance for a cabin crew member. I had my F/O (First Officer) call ops requesting paramedics to the aircraft. I called Maintenance to let them know of our event and they requested we fill out the Aircraft Smoke Odor Report ASAP which we did.My F/O said he smelled something on final. The F/A's towards the front of the aircraft didn't notice anything but in the aft cabin some crew members and passengers did although only the one crew member requested medical attention and I don't know which one that was. By the time I got out of the cockpit everyone was gone so I never got any more information on our F/A.,A321 Captain reported an event with extreme fumes in the main cabin while in the descent to land.

We immediately put our oxygen mask on and stop the climb at 5000 feet. The lead Flight Attendant also reported smoke in the cabin. We decided to return back to the field. We notified ATC of our situation. We ran the ELIMINATION OF ODOR/FUMES IN FLIGHT DECK/CABIN. We landed back in ZZZ once cleared the runway we had the fire department walk around the aircraft. The fire department did not see anything unusual so afterwards we were given gate to taxi to and deplaned. Some passengers need medical assistance due to the heat and the cabin and the smoke.,A320 Flight Crew reported the flight deck and cabin filled with smoke shortly after takeoff causing a return to the departure airport.

The air became very thick and hard for me to breathe even to the point of saying I feel like I can't breathe and began to use my sweater to breathe in. I was Flight Attendant (FA) D and also noticed that passengers in the back were agitated and closing their air vent and making complaints. When passengers deplaned the D FA approached the Captain to explain the severity and effects we were beginning to feel from this and he proceeded to write it up. We all exited the aircraft to try to get some fresh air as it was uncomfortable in the cabin. Individually we called the [medical services] line and were sent to Urgent Care which in turn sent us to the hospital. I was treated with oxygen and gave 3 blood samples to find out my carbon monoxide was elevated to a 3.2. The last blood sample was what the company ordered and I don't know what that was for. I was released with the recommendation not to fly until [a week later]. There were issues with Crew Services not knowing where we were even though our Base Supervisor was in contact with them about our incident. After difficulty with Crew Services that was handled by FA A and FA B we made it to the airport [for] the return flight. I have heard this particular [aircraft] has had a history of this odor and to prevent this; proper maintenance should be completed before the aircraft is put back into service.,A319 Flight Attendants reported experiencing physical effects from fumes in the cabin.

We notified the Captain about the previous fume event. During inflight right before descent we noticed a very strong smell and notified the First Flight Attendant and Captain. The fumes got in my throat and had I felt a burning sensation. I tried to cover my nose and mouth upon landing.During landing while strapped in my jump seat I noticed a deadheading crewmember looked very pale. When I asked him if he needed medical assistance upon arrival he agreed. I notified the First Flight Attendant to let the Captain know we needed an ambulance. Since I had the burning sensation in my throat and a pounding headache a family member drove me to an emergency room to get looked at as suggested by Inflight Supervisors.The plane had a fume event the day prior. Why would they put our health and safety at risk and use the plane right away?,A321 Flight Attendant reported feeling ill from exposure to fumes in the cabin during descent.

Preflight preparation; push-back; start-up and taxi out were uneventful. We took off on runway XX with a flaps 5 setting. Climb out to FL340 was also uneventful. Approximately 40 minutes after takeoff we got a C HYD QTY EICAS message. We pulled up the status page and noticed that the Center hydraulic quantity was at .43 and decreasing rapidly. The First Officer pulled out the QRH and iPad and referenced the procedures for this anomaly. The Center pumps; both electric and the demand pumps were secured. This slowed the quantity decrease; but did not stop it. I initiated a SATCOM call to Dispatch and was eventually conferenced in with [Maintenance]; the [Operations] and the 756 fleet guys. A detailed discussion ensued covering all implications of continuing the flight or turning around and returning to ZZZZ or another suitable divert aerodrome. The divert option was eventually ruled out as it would involve fuel dumping (13000 available to dump) and at least two hours of loitering to burn down to max landing weight for the 767-300. My concerns about the legality of continuing an ETOPS flight without the Center system and associated loss of our HMG (Hydraulic Motor Generator) were assuaged and we collectively (internal flight crew and external resources) decided to continue the crossing. The flight proceeded normally until approaching ZZZ. I was on third break and returned to the cockpit approximately 50 minutes before scheduled landing. The Center system quantity at this point was .11. The three of us discussed all possible scenarios again and we began our descent. When we checked in with Approach; we [advised ATC] and requested the ILS to XXR so as not to interrupt normal operations on the center and left runways. This also gave us potential maneuvering airspace on the less congested side of the airport.At 6000 ft. and about 35 miles from the approach end of XXR; we ran the checklist items. We were reasonably certain that the Center system would not work due to the 'spoiler' EICAS when I deployed speed brakes on the descent. When the demand pump was turned on; the Center pressure lights remained on; so we continued the applicable checklist. We had slowed to 220 knots clean maneuvering and began to bring the flaps down via the alternate method. As the flaps transited from 0 to 1; we got a LE SLATS ASYMMETRY EICAS and the flaps stopped moving. We were now around 22 miles from the runway and still at 220 knots. We informed tower that we might have to execute a 360 degree turn to work the additional emergency of split slats. We had also lost the Left Yaw damper earlier in the flight. The relief pilot was working the LE slats problem while we continued the alternate flap problem. I called for the alternate gear extension at some point in this process and the gear came down and locked as advertised. I asked the PM (Pilot Monitoring) to select flaps 5 on the alternate switch and around 12 miles from touchdown; the flaps began to move again; but still with the asymmetry indication. I asked the relief pilot if that was going to be a problem and he said 'not if the flaps come down.' We continued to dial the speed back as the flaps came down and after almost 6 minutes from alternate flap initiation and at approximately 8-10 miles; we got the aircraft at flaps 20 and target speed 150 (ref 144 + 6 knots for the wind {120/12}).I disengaged the auto flight at 1500 ft. and flew a normal approach to touch down on XXR. We exited the runway and with the Reserve Steering and Brakes switch engaged had enough standpipe pressure to clear the runway using nose wheel steering. Emergency responders were there immediately and confirmed that we still had hydraulic fluid leaking from the port wheel well area and we soon had zero Center quantity as the remaining fluid leaked out. A tug eventually came and towed us to [our] gate. I would like to say that this was a textbook collaboration of resources; both internal (cockpit and cabin) and external. We worked as a team and resolved what could have been a serious emergency. I kept the pursuer engaged from soon after the caution light until after landing. I did not ask that the cabin be prepared for evacuation; due to the nature of the problem and only an extra 8-10 knot approach speed expected. Although I didn't use the term 'Cabin Advisory'; the words I used when briefing her were reflective of that process. Tip of the hat to all involved and 220 souls on board were happy to have landed safely.,B767 flight crew reported a hydraulic leak that developed inflight worsened inflight causing an Asymmetrical flap and slat problem as well as the loss of the left yaw dampener and primary steering upon landing.

Communications established. We agreed we needed to land ASAP. The First Officer notified the tower that we needed to return. The tower cleared us to land and gave us vectors to visual XYL; the vectors were too tight and a stabilized approach was not possible. A go around was initiated and was vectored to runway WZ visual backed up by an ILS; equipment was standing by; normal landed and cleared runway WZ; stopped on taxiway. Fire rescue did quick inspection of aircraft exterior. Fire chief radioed all clear and followed us to gate.At the gate; with engines off and APU on; the aircraft would not depressurize. APU bleed was selected off and outflow valve was manually opened. Passengers deplaned uneventfully.Smoke/Odor was limited to flight deck and masks were worn until downwind WZ; there was a problem seeing with the masks on as it was fogging up. I felt it was a safer option for me to see properly during landing. Notes:-Smoke/ Odor seemed to be less at lower power settings-Flight Attendants were given [proper] instructions on downwind for runway XYL-We were unable to contact dispatch or receive any landing data (First Officer was able to contact ops on their frequency and told them the situation and got a gate assignment)-Landing was under max landing weigh at approximately 130;000 pounds.-Take off to landing was approximately 20 minutes.,B737 Captain reported 'acid oily smell' on rotation and returned to departure airport.

First Officer (FO); FB and I smelled it too. The FO and I thought it smelled like ozone; and we were flying through an area of thunderstorms. However; the FB thought it smelled electrical. We donned oxygen masks and I got out the Quick Action Card (QAC); but the FA reported the odor dissipated; so we suspended the procedure and removed our masks. Due to a late clearance for approach from ATC we had to go missed approach and at the same time the FA reported the odor again and stronger than before. We donned oxygen masks and I performed the QAC procedure and talked to ATC while the FO flew the aircraft. We were vectored back around cells for another approach. There was never any smoke visible; just electrical smell which again dissipated after three to four minutes; which is partly why I didn't declare an emergency; but in hindsight I should have anyway. We suspended further procedures after doing the Quick action card; but kept our masks on for the approach and landing; which was uneventful. I put the events in the logbook and debriefed maintenance at the gate. FO and FB performance was exemplary and contributed greatly to a coordinated crew response to a very busy situation.,A330 Captain and Relief First Officer reported odor in cabin causing a return to departure airport.

I did not make it to the lav and was in the cockpit when the symptoms started. As soon as I could I went to the lav and vomited again. The flight attendant was in the cockpit with the Captain who was on oxygen. I came back to the cockpit and said I was starting to feel better because I thought I got it all out of my system. We continued the flight and landed safely in ZZZ. That night I was nauseous and vomiting all night.,B777 First Officer reported becoming ill after eating a crew meal.

I asked what the odor smelled like and she stated she wasn't sure. I then asked her if it smelled like something burning; electrical; or fuel. She stated it was probably more of a fuel smell. I asked her if the smell was throughout the cabin and she wasn't sure. I then called the forward #1 Flight Attendant and asked her if she had any strange odors in the forward cabin. She stated no; she smelled nothing. I then asked the aft cabin Flight Attendant if any passengers could smell the odor and if passengers were becoming nauseated. She did not know. I then asked her to walk forward from the rear of the cabin toward the front to determine where the smell began and where it stopped and to check and see how the passengers in the affected cabin were feeling. At this point the First Officer and I started the Aircraft Odor checklist. Several minutes later the aft cabin Flight Attendant called me back and stated that one passenger thought the odor smelled like hydraulic fluid and several others thought it smelled like fuel. She also stated the smell began around Row 17 and continued all the way back to the aft galley/rear of the aircraft; but that it seemed to be less intense. I then asked her how she was feeling and how the passengers were feeling. She reported that both of them (#2 and #4 flight attendants) and several passengers were now feeling nauseous; light headed and dizzy. I asked if she thought the odor still smelled like fuel and if the odor was getting stronger and she stated yes.At this point; with the number #1 Flight Attendant also on the interphone; I explained to them that I was going to [advise ATC] and get us on the ground as quickly as possible; and that I would get back to them shortly. I quickly gave the aircraft and radio control over to the First Officer and had him [advise ATC]; directing him to proceed direct to the RNAV IAF. I then completed the Aircraft Odor checklist with the assumption being FUEL as the possible source. The difficulty for me in accomplishing this checklist was trying to determine if the odor was classified as strong or as mild/moderate. I chose strong and proceeded to the Smoke; Fire and Fumes checklist. Accomplishing this checklist left me somewhat confused since we had no smoke; fire or fumes; but rather a strong aircraft odor that smelled like fuel. In this case the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist sent me back to the Aircraft Odor Checklist. By this point in the Aircraft Odor Checklist we had started our descent and I then referred to and accomplished the non routine landing checklist; advised dispatch via ACARS; briefed the #1 Flight Attendant on a precautionary landing and emphasizing no ground evacuation anticipated; and then made an address to the passengers regarding our situation. Once I was able to focus my attention back in the cockpit I accomplished the descent checklist and then took back control of the aircraft. The First Officer did an outstanding job getting the aircraft direct and coordinating with ATC. The approach and landing were uneventful. Once we landed and cleared the runway I let the flight attendants know what was occurring and that we were not going to evacuate. I then stopped the aircraft on a taxiway and had the fire chief check our aircraft; in particular for potential fuel leaks and/or heat signatures. Then I made a passenger address further explaining what was occurring outside the aircraft and that everything was ok and safe. The fire chief then gave us an all clear report and we proceeded to our gate with the fire trucks following closely behind. Once at the gate and parked the aft cabin flight attendants called again and reported that the fuel odor/fumes were even stronger than before. Within a minute the fire chief came to the cockpit and report strong fuel fumes outside around the airplane. We quickly deplaned the passengers. Hind sight indicates an obvious fuel leak that penetrated the air conditioning system.According to the QRH Aircraft Odor Checklist; an ODOR is not smoke or fumes associated with a fire source; an odor is any smell; and a fume is dangerous to inhale. So what did I have on my flight an ODOR or a FUME? With so many new; young; and inexperienced flight attendants in our airline today the descriptions; or lack of descriptions; leave Captains unsure of what really is an odor or a dangerous fume. Once on the ground and at the gate it was clear that we had a major fuel leak; fume; or vapor problem. I think we should look at further defining the word FUMES in our Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist to include Fuel Fumes. Furthermore; with hindsight as a guide; I think the checklist needs to address passenger electronic equipment; which should be immediately turned off and shut down if fuel fumes exist in the cabin. Numerous cases in the United States have had individuals igniting gasoline fumes at fueling pumps while parked at a gas station; blowing up the entire gas station and killing themselves; all because they answered their cell phone or turned on the light function on their cell phone. Static electricity appears to be the problem with electronic devices; and if fuel fumes are strong enough in the cabin of an airplane; then the subsequent result could be catastrophic.,B737 flight crew reported fuel fumes/odor in the aft cabin resulted in a direct approach and landing at the planned destination.

We had a firm landing. I felt no need to enter anything in the aircraft log. No masks dropped. It was just a firm touchdown. Entered wake turbulence at about 40 ft AGL. Found out from my First Officer who was greeting passengers after flight that a male passenger complained of an injury due to landing. It's an everyday occurrence. Talk and plan.,A321 Captain reported a passenger complained of an injury following wake turbulence during landing.

I noticed smoke at that time coming from behind the First Officer. Oxygen Masks were donned and communications established. First Officer was already flying so I assigned him flying and ATC Communication duties. I start Quick Action Items and QRH procedures.FO (First Officer) notified ZZZ Center under my direction and navigated back towards ZZZ airport.QRH procedures were performed methodically and we found the source of smoke to be Air Conditioning problems associated with Pack 1.Smoke went away immediately after accomplishing QRH procedures. Then established communications with flight attendants through interphone system. They stated NO Smoke in the cabin. Informed them we had smoke in the cockpit that was contained and were returning to ZZZ.I asked them to prepare for a precautionary landing and gave an ETA. Then made a PA to passengers that we had a maintenance situation that required a return to ZZZ.We reviewed the non-routine landing checklist in QRH. Rest of the flight was normal SOP. No Limitations were exceeded nor any flight parameters. ie. Heading; altitude; directions in generalWe can't avoid these types of situations but I will say; the resources and procedures available to us contained the situation quickly. I can't think of anything different that would have helped in this situation. Communication was outstanding within the crew; ATC; emergency services in ZZZ and the company.,A319 Flight Crew reported smoke entered the cockpit during climb that dissipated when Pack 1 was selected to off.

This noise progressively got louder. After about 10 minutes we began to feel vibrations on floor in flight deck. Cabin crew could then hear noise in forward cabin as well. I put in a request for dispatch to call me on VHF and include maintenance (MX) on the line. While dispatch was getting maintenance on line we began to smell odor of hot wires or electrical components. This became stronger pretty quickly. I began to survey alternate options. Determined best options based on ND display and MCDU were ZZZ about 70 miles east and ZZZ1 about 160 west. I decided on ZZZ and advised dispatch of deteriorating conditions when he returned to frequency with MX. He agreed that ZZZ was good diversion and stated he would advise all necessary parties and send landing data. I transferred controls to FO (First Officer); [notified ATC]; and set up FMGC for approach while FO worked on descent. Briefed cabin crew of diversion with TEST items stating cabin prep was not required. About halfway thru descent to ZZZ the avionics cooling blower fan ceased and the CB tripped. With this; the fumes and noise stopped. Normal landing on runway XX and taxi to gate. Fire rescue crews remained on scene until MX Could open compartment to examine cooling fan. Passengers deplaned using jetway.,A320 flight crew reported diverting due to smoke and fumes from an avionics cooling blower fan malfunction.

On approximately 12-mile final; we heard ATC call out traffic behind us converging towards the parallel 16R. Shortly after; we received our first RA. The First Officer (FO) reacted appropriately and we were quickly Clear of Conflict. We informed Approach and let them know we were continuing. Again; at around a seven or eight mile final; we received an RA to descend. Following the RA we got fast (approximately 190 KIAS). We also descended to approximately 7600 feet before the RA went away. At that point we began a very shallow non-standard go-around because we were partially configured; closing on the traffic in front of us; and concerned much of a climb would put us into conflict with the traffic behind us again. Frankly; we were threading a needle because ATC had high radio congestion; there was traffic in front of us; traffic to our right; and traffic on approach to our left. While reacting the second time; we informed ATC and let them know we would be going around. ATC gave us a warning that we were too low; and switched us to Tower for go-around instructions. Once on Tower we began transitioning to a normal go-around and returned to land uneventfully.,B737 flight crew reported two TCAS RA's while on approach to DEN that resulted in a missed approach.

Upon reaching HIMOM (IF) we were unable to continue the RNAV approach because we dropped LNAV and so we requested the visual approach to Runway 34R. The controller cleared us for the visual approach to 34R then offered a runway change to 35L even though the controller stated that it might be 'a little late in the game to switch'. We accepted the runway change and decided to switch. I had already disconnected the autopilot and autothrottles in anticipation for landing on Runway 34R. We were assigned a 080 heading for the visual to Runway 35L. We were then given a subsequent turn to 020 to intercept final for Runway 35L. Attempting to hand fly the aircraft and make sure the new approach was loaded by the Captain; and acquire an electronic centerline to the new runway; my workload increased to a level I didn't anticipate. This caused me to inadvertently shallow my turn to final. While trying to work through this issue I lost situational awareness and was focused more on making sure the ILS was loaded for RWY 35L instead of visually clearing my turn and getting established on final. During the turn to/through final we got an RA from TCAS that stated to level off. I leveled the aircraft and the Captain notified ATC of the RA and they stated for us to fly the LOC for Runway 35L. The controller then asked if we could continue the approach or if we needed to go missed approach. We were high and too close to continue the approach due to leveling off for the RA so we executed a missed approach and were given vectors for the missed. We were vectored for and flew the ILS to 35R and landed. After landing the Ground Controller gave us a number to contact Denver TRACON. The Captain [did so; and] discussed the events leading up to the approach.,B737NG First Officer reported executing a go-around after a last minute runway change led to an airborne conflict and an unstabilized approach.

This was NOT a reduced power takeoff as is usually the case per the performance numbers we received on ACARS. It was a normal takeoff with no discrepancies noticed. We were assigned a left turn heading 320 with our takeoff clearance and began the turn as we were passing 400 FT AGL. When established in the turn and climbing through approximately 600 FT; we heard a very loud bang from the left engine and felt the airplane shudder in response. I immediately looked at the engine instruments on the E/WD (upper screen) and noticed the EGT dial in red with a tick at the very upper end of the instrument and also noticed the rest of the engine instruments were in amber; many of them with XX's for the readouts. I had immediately thought we hit a goose as there were many reports of geese sightings during our approach just a couple of hours prior. As we were passing through a heading appropriate for a crosswind leg of a VFR pattern; my intention was to fly a visual pattern back to the field as quickly as possible. My main concern was the possibility of hitting another goose and losing our remaining engine. I was hand-flying at the time and thought we were at a safe altitude; and instructed the Pilot Monitoring (PM) to run the ENG FAIL ECAM and secure the engine as we were headed right around for a return to [departure airport]. It became clear to both of us that ATC had cleared the area for us. They provided us an exceptional level of support and vectored us to a final. Though we had no time to contact Dispatch; we did brief the flight attendants on the event (which they had already figured out) and told them that it should be an uneventful landing. At the time of our departure; [the airport] was changing over from a sole east operation to [a different plan] with winds increasing in speed out of the south. As I was trying to change the destination in the MCDU in order to set up the approach in the box; ATC provided us the frequency and vectored us over to [the runway]; providing us the new localizer frequency. I was unable to change the destination and abandoned that attempt in order to fly the LOC and G/S in for a safe landing. With a quartering tailwind; the approach was becoming increasingly unstable and as we were approaching the final gate at 500 FT AGL; I determined it was safest to go-around at about 700 FT. The procedures for the single-engine go-around were executed and ATC vectored us back to the downwind asking us the requested runway and the intercept mileage inbound. We requested a runway change to the longest runway given that we were overweight. We requested a five-mile final not wanting to go out too far. The second approach was flown meeting all the stabilized approach criteria at every gate to a smooth landing; as I wanted to minimize the vertical rate of descent at touchdown. We rolled out long; cleared the runway and stopped the aircraft on the parallel taxiway in order for the ARFF to inspect the engine from afar. They saw no visible damage. Before taxiing the aircraft further; I made a PA to the passengers advising them of the issue and that we were safely on the ground and apologized for not updating them sooner as we were very busy managing the event. We received our new gate assignment and parked the aircraft and did our parking checklist. Codes were sent for the overweight landing and the engine failure. We were met at the gate by Flight Operations Management who ensured we were OK and we proceeded down to the tarmac to inspect the engine together after the passengers deplaned.,A320 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after experiencing an engine failure shortly after takeoff.

After level off the smell dissipated. Still felt very nauseated; headache; dizziness and tightness in throat throughout the flight. On descent the same smell continued with same symptoms. FA 4 started feeling nauseated and headache. After landing I could still smell the odor and ask FA 1 to come to the back of airplane and midway through the cabin she started feeling nauseated; headache and dizziness. Captain put the event in the logbook and the plane was taken out of service. FA 1; 2; and 4 went to clinic and then hospital for blood work. After 5 hours blood was taken. Results were normal. The blood work should have been drawn a lot earlier.,A319 Flight Attendant reported feeling ill after being exposed to fumes in the cabin. Other flight attendants reported similar effects; and three of them went to the hospital.

He became very ill; very fast; in what I would describe as extreme pain; as well as nausea and vomiting. It came in waves; and got progressively worse. We brought the First Officer; who was on break; back to the flight deck early. The Captain retreated to the rest seat in discomfort. Due to the awkward switch out; the First Officer sat in the left seat. I remained in the flying right seat as the First Officer was disoriented and needed to be briefed. I remained in the right seat. I briefed the First Officer on the situation; as well as the lead Flight Attendant. Up until this point; the Captain did not want any medical treatment; because he was not wanting to interfere with the flight. When he retreated to the rest seat; his situation became much worse; and a doctor was paged for.I briefed the First Officer that I did not feel comfortable with the Captain returning; at any point; to his seat based on his condition. The First Officer agreed; and the lead Flight Attendant also in a separate conversation expressed the same feeling. The First Officer and I decided he would remain in the left seat; and I continue flying and execute the landing from the right seat. As the Captain's situation got worse; him returning became a non-issue; because he was unable to return to the flight deck and we deemed him incapacitated in the sense that we were now operating without referring to the Captain for decisions because he was being tended to by doctors; was in audible pain; violently vomiting; and all the symptoms of a bad kidney stone. The passengers didn't see anything.The First Officer and I worked with dispatch; medlink; and together formulated a game plan. After a warm compress made no difference; the decision was made by Medlink; the onboard doctor; and us; to divert. The Captain also expressed that he was a '12 out of 10' in pain. Having flown with the Captain before; for him to even admit pain means it's big. For him to now be ok diverting confirmed he clearly was not in good shape. His audible pain and vomiting continued. After considering multiple airports; an airport was decided on due to it being exactly 170 miles in front of the nose; a hub; access to medical care; connecting flights for passengers; and a known airport since we'd now be taxiing the aircraft. It was middle of the night; clear weather; and while we knew this airport is busy; this situation warranted it as a diversion.I [notified] ATC. I was also the pilot flying now and the First Officer took care of the rest of the satellite call with Medlink and Dispatch; worked the cabin aspect; and other Pilot Monitoring duties. ATC was great and we barely had to turn; we received a straight in to the runway. We made sure not to mention the word 'captain' on the radio due to the sensitive nature of the emergency; however after inquiring; ATC did know it was a member of the flight deck crew. We also left the PAs very vague and did not say it was the Captain to avoid panic. We followed the diversion [procedures]; and had a rather uneventful diversion and landing. The First Officer did a great job with a quick taxi - we rolled to the end of the runway; and simply made the left turn to the terminal. That's where the problems began. As soon as we turned onto the ramp; I did not see any blue flashing lights. That worried me; because they knew for the last 25 minutes that we were diverting in with a severe medical emergency; and needed an ambulance. None was inside. To summarize; we waited 40 minutes after touchdown for a simple paramedic in a sedan to come. He gave us attitude; said he just got out of work [very early in the morning]; do not rush him; and he would determine whether or not an ambulance was needed; not us. When he determined an ambulance was needed; we waited almost an additional hour for the ambulance. The final times I recorded looked like this: ON at XX:55Z; IN at XY:09Z; paramedic showed up at XY:35Z; and ambulance at XZ:23Z. Unacceptable.I tried multiple frequencies; begged multiple people; including operations; and Tower even though we were parked at the stand to get help. None was available; and the Captain now appeared to almost be going into shock. People became curious and we tried to keep everyone seated. Excuses from operations; paramedic; and staff was that we were the third flight needing an ambulance that morning. I will not go into more detail as my feelings are beyond strong that the airport failed us on the medical front. It not only was an embarrassment; but the Captain could have become more injured. Finally when the ambulance came; the Captain walked down on his own power. I made sure to cover his uniform and hide his hat/jacket so the passengers wouldn't take photos out the window 'of the sick captain.' He went to a hospital; and we waited a few more hours to wrap up hotel and the logistical aspects. I'd like to personally say our whole crew; dispatch; medlink; ATC; and airport operations staff were all fantastic. A great team effort turned this medical emergency into a smooth rolling practiced procedure.,B767 flight crew reported diverting due to Captain's illness.

The most recent occurred in night/IMC conditions with heavy thunderstorms at cruise; descent and approach. Ground based ATC radar was used to readout our altitude and groundspeed. We were unable to fly the GPS approach in use due to loss of VNAV. We used the opposing runway with raw data ILS on standby system with 20-30 knot tailwinds on a wet runway. The onboard [checklist] is in total error regarding the pitch and power settings. The QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) references were accurate using the standby attitude indicator. Also the Captain's iPad froze and the onboard paper QRH was used.

Weather was 040/09kts; 1 SM visibility; BR (mist); OVC002. We departed off RWY XX using Flaps 5 with Engine Anti-ice ON. Assigned to fly runway heading to 10;000 feet. Once level cleared direct to ZZZZZ intersection and climb and maintain 23;000. PF (Pilot Flying) commenced the turn and climb using VNAV and LNAV. Passing through approximately 18;000 the PNF noticed the left engine oil quantity at 6 quarts and decreasing. PNF remarked that he checked it prior to departure and knew that it was good. PNF mentioned to PF that we should level off and slow down to monitor the engine parameters. ATC was informed; 'we may have a potential problem and need to level off.' ATC granted an early level off and asked the nature of our problem. The PNF stated that the left engine oil quantity was decreasing but all other indications were normal. PNF and PF discussed the possibility that it could possibly be only the one gauge indicating a malfunction but decided that it would be prudent to turn back towards ZZZ in case other indications began to manifest. The PNF asked ATC for a return to ZZZ stating that the left engine was still operating but there was a possibility of an engine shutdown should the left engine indications continue to deteriorate. PF followed ATC instructions. PNF looked through 737 QRH for an ENG OIL QTY LOW checklist but there was not one. PNF did find an Engine LOW OIL PRESSURE and Engine High Oil Temperature checklist but neither of these applied. PNF began to review the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist in case it became necessary to shut down the engine. Soon afterwards; the left engine oil quantity decreased to zero; the left engine oil pressure dropped to zero (?); and the left engine oil temperature turned red. The PNF then performed the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist and secured the left engine. ATC was informed that the left engine was now secured; the need for delay vectors to complete all required checklists and program the FMC for the approach and landing; and the fuel remaining and number of souls onboard. The PNF sent a quick message to Dispatch stating;' Left ENG oil quantity zero. Return to ZZZ.' The PF flew all assigned headings and altitudes. The PNF completed the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist and informed the lead Flight Attendant of the nature of the emergency and that we would be landing in approximately 15 minutes. The PNF then informed the passengers of the situation and that we would be landing shortly. The PF used the autopilot at all times and was able to program the FMC and set up the approach while the PNF was finishing up checklists; briefings; PA announcements. The PNF then ran the ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE LANDING checklist using VREF ICE speeds. Landing weight was approximately 1;000 lbs below max landing weight; NON-NORMAL CONFIGURATION LANDING DISTANCE for One Engine Inoperative Landing Flaps 15 was adequate. PNF told the PF to continue to fly the ILS XYR approach to landing since he had a good feel for the aircraft and its trim condition. PNF quickly set up his own approach plates; and confirmed crossing altitudes; minimums; frequencies; etc. Both the PNF and the PF felt confident that the aircraft was well stabilized and ready for the approach and landing. PF flew the ILS XYR approach and landed very nicely. The ZZZ fire trucks had already been alerted and were standing by. Normal landing and taxi to the gate. Briefed maintenance crew of complete symptoms and the need to shut the engine down while airborne.,B737 flight crew reported that left engine oil quantity decreased to zero; resulting in engine shutdown.

We got off the gate several minutes early; followed by an early takeoff. After a normal takeoff; we began our climb out and accelerated towards 300 KIAS.Passing approximately 11;500 feet; I noticed a faint electrical smell and asked the CA (Captain) if he picked up the smell. We immediately looked outside for indications; scanned instruments; and checked systems pages. All appeared normal. Very shortly after scanning and passing approximately 13;000 feet; we experienced a loud 'bang;' followed by pronounced roll into the number one engine. A quick instrument scan revealed excessive EGT; followed by rapid decrease in engine performance. We vocalized what appeared to be engine failure number one. CA called ECAM; which also displayed/confirmed a failed number one engine. I immediately started a level off. After several verbal confirmations of a failed number one engine (we wanted to be certain we were focused on the failed engine); the CA ran the ECAM. Having determined we had a damaged engine; we confirmed no desire to relight and CA discharged agent one.I turned back towards ZZZ and CA [notified ATC]. I then took over coms; coordinating our descent and vectors to ZZZ; while CA communicated with dispatch; FAs (Flight Attendants) and let passengers know our situation/intentions. Because we had just landed at ZZZ one-hour prior; we were familiar with the weather; approach and 12;000 foot runway. With some clouds in the surrounding area; we briefed our plan to use vectors RNAV XX (same approach we flew one-hour prior) as our tool to get a solid visual lock on the field; then remain VMC. Once visual; we wanted to focus on flying a stable single-engine visual approach to landing (without the added effort of flying an IFR approach in VMC conditions). With briefing complete; CA became PF; while I became PM (Pilot Monitoring). Continuing our descent and well prior to FAF; I confirmed emergency equipment on rollout; called field in sight; and we proceeded inbound visually.CA flew a beautiful single engine landing. We landed at XX:50Z; we flew for 22 minutes.I made callouts; announced 'remain seated; remain seated' and coordinated for a stop and inspection. Once determined safe to taxi; we taxied to gate.,A320 flight crew reported an engine failure during climb resulted in a return to the departure airport.

I deselected the autobrakes by accident during the after takeoff checklist. Vectored back around; shot LOC XX again. Discovered autobrakes off on landing.,B737 flight crew reported responding to a false RA; resulting in an unstable approach; go around; and inadvertent deselect of autobrakes.

Zero forward visibility. Using weather radar. Seatbelt sign on. Occasional light turbulence. In the cabin; FA B (Flight Attendant) and FA C are standing in the rear galley. A paramedic and a nurse are assisting an ill passenger in seat 19b. Paramedics are waiting at destination. No ATC [notification was made].We see a small; individual cell ahead on radar: about 4 miles wide with light green rain indication and small amber center. We receive deviation clearance to the left from Control. We change course and continue descent. Visibility zero. When abeam of the cell on our right side; we flew through some imbedded cumulus and a short burst of rain. We received a quick; sudden jolt of moderate turbulence.I called back to the cabin via intercom to check with the cabin crew. I apologized about the event with no warning from us. I was assured that everything was okay although FA C sounded a bit unhappy about the event.We landed and arrived at the gate at [destination] with paramedics waiting to examine the ill passenger. A lot of confusion at the gate after the passengers deplaned with an army of cleaners coming aboard to 'turn' the aircraft. I saw FA A was moving aft to speak to FAs C and B while the cleaners and ground supervisors were on the airplane between us. The paramedics had left the jetway with the ill passenger. It was going to be difficult to wade through the cleaners to speak to my crew who were scheduled to fly the aircraft back to [origin]. Not having heard from them while at the gate; [First Officer] and I assumed our cabin crew were okay. We exited the aircraft to start our overnight.24 hours later; [First Officer] and I arrived at the aircraft for the northbound flight to [origin]. FA C and FA B were present and met us. It was then when we heard that they had sustained injury during the previous day while standing in the rear galley from the moderate turbulence jolt event. Both crew members complained of back and shoulder strain. In addition; FA C had sustained a small cut on her hand while grabbing a hand hold to steady herself.The event occurred because I failed to warn the cabin crew of possible moderate turbulence during descent. So; the crew was completing normal duties when the unexpected turbulence occurred. As is well known; turbulence effects are magnified when in the aft section of aircraft and also there was no warning of small bumps before the big jolt took place.I need to communicate better with my cabin crew during flight to warn them about turbulence ahead and also at the gate after such an event (by intercom; if necessary); to make sure that they are okay. I am not happy about my lack of knowledge about my cabin crew condition as I left the aircraft. One of my roles is to make sure they are okay and to assist them if they are not okay.,A319 Captain reported learning the next day that Flight Attendants had been injured during an inbound turbulence encounter.

We requested to level off (FL 180); and started the QRH procedure for a -700 Pack Trip Off. The procedure calls for increasing pack temperature to reduce load; which was unresponsive in both auto and manual modes; and a reset of the pack was also unsuccessful. During the reset attempts; cabin pressure began climbing; and a further descent was requested (10;000 feet). The Captain began an assertive descent; when around 12;000 feet MSL; the cabin altitude alarm sounded. We followed the memory items to don masks and establish communications; and leveled at 10;000 feet shortly thereafter. Since masks were no longer required; we took them off; elected to return to our departure airport; and landed without further incident. Being a very dynamic situation with limited time and procedures complicated due to an already deferred pack; some of the procedures and communications could have been better to facilitate CRM and lessen distraction and confusion during the event.,737 flight crew reported a return to departure airport due to a loss of pressurization.

During takeoff roll; approximately ten knots prior to rotate speed; nose gear began lifting off of runway. Nose down force applied to side stick controller failed to control pitch. At five knots prior to rotate speed nose gear became fully airborne and the aircraft continued an uncommanded rotation until fully airborne. For several seconds the side stick controller was unable to overcome the continued increase in pitch. As the automated pitch trim system continued to trim; normal flight characteristics were restored after approximately 20-30 seconds. Aircraft accelerated near the flap speed limit until control of the aircraft was restored.Both dispatch and maintenance were fully debriefed about this incident. I am waiting for the results of their investigations. Improper aircraft loading and/or errors in the [performance calculations] are suspected.Feedback from dispatch and maintenance are required to determine the cause of the incident prior to making any recommendations.,A321 Captain reported uncommanded rotation prior to V1 that could not be overcome by the side stick.

The pilot monitoring started the QRH procedure for the Auto Fail Light. During the procedure the cabin was uncontrollable; the cabin altitude went above 10;000 feet and the masks dropped in the cabin. Both crew members donned oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent. We established communications with the flight attendants and determined all in the cabin were on oxygen and no one had problems at this time. We [notified ATC]; diverted to ZZZ; safely landed the airplane and taxied to the gate.During the QRH procedure; we could not extinguish the Auto Fail light and the cabin became uncontrollable. Small inputs to outflow valve would not correct the situation.,B737-800 flight crew reported a complete loss of pressurization at cruise altitude and that standby control did not recover the system.

There were 2 loud bangs; the aircraft shuddered; and flames were observed coming out of the engine by the passengers. The number 2 N1 dropped from approximately 93% to approximately 71% during the stalls. As soon as the thrust was reduced the compressor stalls stopped. We [advised ATC]; completed the QRH steps (the engine was stabilized so we did not shut it down); and landed at ZZZ1.,B737 flight crew reported that after takeoff the Number 2 engine experienced a compressor stall; but functioned at a reduced power setting until a diversion to a suitable airport could be accomplished.

It didn't last long in the climb and was not noticeable during cruise flight; during descent into ZZZ passing 26;000 or so we started smelling this odor again; while descending further the smell became stronger. The flight attendants in the forward cabin called to say they were smelling a strong odor / fume up in the forward galley area by the cockpit door. Stated it did not extend into the passenger cabin area. As the odor / fume became stronger in the cockpit. I [notified ATC] and we donned our oxygen masks and ran the QRH.We were in significant weather deviating around thunderstorms moderate turbulence; and moderate rain with icing.Note: engine anti-ice was on throughout our descent. Wing anti-ice was on for approx. 5-10 minutes during descent. Odor and fumes seemed confined to the cockpit and forward galley only. Once down around 3-4;000 most of the fume/odor was gone. Successful landing on Runway 4R with winds 080 feet at 26 gusts 34 knots.Aircraft just came from ZZZ1 after a heavy check. It was ferried before this flight. I suspected a left engine bleed issue or fume due to its presence primarily in the cockpit and its recent heavy check. Smell was similar to paint on an exhaust pipe or a BBQ that gets very hot for the first time. No visible haze or smoke was present but the fume was definitely strong enough to require use of the quick don masks for safety. Some mild eye irritation was noted in the last 30 minutes of flight. The cabin crew reported that the fumes were not affecting them or present in the main cabin.Would like to extend our sincere thanks to Center; Approach control and tower/ground controllers for their outstanding support during this event. Also the ready support by ZZZ's crash fire rescue team that responded to our [situation]. They were with us until all the passengers were off the aircraft.I also would like to commend my crew; starting with my First Officer; for his professional performance during this inflight event that was as complicated as it gets; trying to evaluate the source; coordinate with ATC when needed; working with flight attendants and assistance with avoiding severe weather. He was the most important player in this event and his skillset and training was evident all along the way. Kudos for a job well done. Secondly; appreciation for an outstanding job by our flight attendant crew for their exceptional job of preparing our passengers and the cabin for our arrival in this situation. It was a total team effort to get us all to the gate safely.,B737-800 Captain reported fumes in the cockpit and forward during climb; clearing in cruise; and returning on descent.

The Number 1 engine was about 2% below the Number 2 engine and increasing to match it. The EGTs were within normal tolerance and all other engine indications were within the normal range. We were unable to isolate the exact cause of the unusual vibration. The APU was started as a precaution. Descending through 7;000 MSL the aircraft began to vibrate. We were still unable to isolate the source of the vibration. [ATC was notified] and we requested RWY XXR. As we leveled at 6;000 MSL the vibration increased and we were able to confirm the source of the vibration was the Number 1 engine and that it was compressor stalling. The power to the engine was reduced to idle; the engine was operating without compressor stalling; and the vibration ceased. The engine was left in idle power for the approach. After landing the engine was shut down; the aircraft was inspected by the emergency response team; and we taxied to the gate.As a footnote: The [ARFF; Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting] team was not able to immediately come on to the runway. When I asked them for the inspection of the left engine they were still holding short of the runway and needed to get permission from tower before coming to inspect the aircraft.,A321 Captain reported high engine vibrations during descent.

I thought it was on my side of the aircraft and the Captain thought it was on his side of the aircraft. We discussed what it might be; too high for a bird strike; maybe a panel came off; slight roll back on one of the engines; etc. We checked all systems throughout the flight and every system was normal. We sent Maintenance a message to inspect the aircraft when we arrived in ZZZ. For the next 2 or so hours all indications remained normal. Smooth flight; good weather; nice east flight. We then began our descent into ZZZ; power on slow descents; idle descents; everything remained normal. I was flying the aircraft and the Captain was the PM (Pilot Monitoring). CA (Captain) continued to check the systems throughout the descent. On downwind; we were given a clearance to descend to 4000 feet. I used open descent which is an idle descent because I thought it might be a short final approach. When the # 2 engine came to idle; the vibration started and from that time it stayed at idle. We saw a N1 vibration on the lower ECAM at one time of 9.9. CA immediately called and [advised ATC] and asked for priority. We were landing on XXL and the tower offered XXC so we took [it]. We proceeded on downwind and turned on an 8 to 10 mile final. Tower got us on the ground quick. CA asked if I was comfortable landing the aircraft and I replied yes and continued. We landed the aircraft and rolled to a stop close to where the fire trucks were. During the rollout; we got an ECAM message that the engine failed and tower called and said we had fire coming out the tail pipe. At the end of the roll out CA took the aircraft came to a stop and set the parking brake. He then called for the evacuation checklist so we would be ready because by that time we were already talking to Fire Rescue who had pulled up several trucks and were hosing down the right engine. We never got any kind of fire indication on the FLT deck. They told us not to evacuate. We stayed on the runway for about an hour while Fire Rescue and maintenance made the decision on what to do with the aircraft and passengers. They brought out a super tug and towed us to a gate. This is about the best I can do to describe what happened. During the evacuation checklist; CA did blow the fire bottle on the #2 engine as Fire Rescue was approaching but he elected not to blow a bottle on the #1 engine which was fine by me since nothing was wrong with it; Fire Rescue was approaching; and he had not given the evacuation command.,A320 First Officer reported problems with the #2 engine; including significant vibration indication; engine failure ECAM and visible flames from the tailpipe during landing roll.

After we discussing the issue; and not seeing any issues in the cockpit; (cabin pressure); everything was normal. However; we did decide to lower the cabin temp. A message was sent to Dispatch to call us with [Maintenance]. [Maintenance] was no help.First Officer called the Flight Attendant and got more info from them and then talked with MedLink. I was the Pilot Flying trying to get lower altitude; however; ride reports below were light to mod turbulence. I decide to stay at FL360. Eventually; we did get down to FL280. MedLink call took forever. Flight Attendant couldn't find the med that they were instructed to take. About this time; we were getting close to starting our descent. First Officer stated he was getting a headache. He put his oxygen mask on. ATC started to slow us and vector us around. I felt we need to get on the ground ASAP. [We] went straight to [destination]. Paramedics met the plane.,B737NG Captain reported several crew members and a passenger were feeling lightheaded and dizzy for unknown reasons in cruise flight.

We had a jumpseater (not familiar with the B777; but familiar with Sat Com) and none of us could quite figure out who to use for a Sat phone call to Dispatch/Med Link. The registered nurse (passenger) on board recommended we land ASAP as the seizure passenger's vital signs were crashing. I was the Pilot Flying and the Captain was managing coordination. We obtained a clearance back to ZZZ as we were still at least 45 minutes from the CP and headed back direct. We also [advised ATC] via our ATC data link. Captain was able to work an HF phone patch to Med Link but the radios were very difficult to hear and transfer information. Everything had to be repeated several times. Additionally; the flight attendants were bombarding us with information. I was flying and trying to set up for recovery into ZZZ. The jumpseater was trying to help the Captain by relaying information to and from the flight attendants. It was at this point that Captain decided that to minimize the chaos and communication difficulties by exercising his [Captain's] authority and bring the registered nurse up to the flight deck to work directly with Med Link. She was not an [air carrier] employee and did not have a badge giving her cockpit access; but given all that was going on; it was better to have her where she could talk directly to Med Link. A Flight Attendant accompanied her on to the flight deck; the door was closed; and she was able to (although with great communication difficulty) work with Med Link to help the patient. By this time; the passenger's vitals had stabilized some and Med Link recommended we continue to [destination] which of course was now impossible. The registered nurse returned to the cabin to help the passenger/patient until we landed and EMTs boarded the aircraft. I support the Captain's decision to have brought the registered nurse up to the flight deck as there was so much going on just recovering the aircraft including dumping fuel that required his attention more than being a conduit of medical data.,B777 First Officer reported a medical diversion while in oceanic airspace.

We both prefer night trips; but because of certain days we bid a day line. Today; the second day; we had an [early] report. Fatigue was definitely a factor. I was the PF (Pilot Flying). Part of our takeoff clearance out of BUR was a traffic call about a helicopter flying near the runway. The takeoff was uneventful. I initiated a turn to the right as per the departure procedure. After being handed off to SCT; we were immediately cleared to a higher altitude. Our TCAS system alerted us to traffic in the area. I engaged the autopilot at 1;000 feet; so I could help look for conflicting traffic. We were handed off to a different Controller.Upon initial contact with the Controller; we were instructed to turn immediately to a heading of 180. I cannot recall if the autopilot was in heading select mode because we got the instruction to turn a 180 very quickly and he did use the word 'immediately.' I disengaged the autopilot; initiated a turn to the south to expedite the de-confliction. The Controller instructed us to tighten up the turn immediately due to a traffic conflict. Due to the urgent tone in his voice I rolled into 45 degrees of bank. He told us of a traffic conflict at 3;000 feet. At that point; we had just passed 4;000 feet. After the Controller de-conflicted the situation and the First Officer and I had no idea of what was going on; I asked him on the radio what had just happened. He stated that we had shot through our 210 heading and we were heading right into arrival traffic for BUR.,B737-700 reported experiencing a heading deviation during departure from BUR resulting in an airborne conflict.

About six miles out I noted from TCAS that we were 3.5 miles in trail. We configured then to get a little more space. At that point the aircraft ahead disappeared from the TCAS screen but was still in sight. As we passed approximately 350 ft the 767 cleared the runway. At approximately 150 ft we began to encounter the wake vortices with a rolling moment that required full lateral controls to counteract. Still within the vortices; I sensed that the 'bottom was beginning to drop out.' I directed the First Officer to go around; which he immediately did. At the same time a plane was taking off from 24L. At this time I believe Tower directed a heading 270; about 20 degrees right; [and] to contact Departure on a frequency I missed and to state reason for go around. At about the end of the runway I reported the [other] aircraft in sight; but we then got a TCAS RA. We began to respond to the RA; which I believe was initially to descend. Once clear I stated reason for the go around was for wake turbulence; got the right departure frequency and called Departure. Departure gave us a climb to 5000 feet. Due to the fact of the RA and what I believe may have been our failure to select TOGA on go around we were not getting any flight director guidance. Puzzled by this; we were slow to climb. ATC informed us they couldn't turn us back until we got to 5000 feet. I took the aircraft; climbed quickly and ATC turned us back to SMO for another approach. Once the flight directors were turned off and reselected FMA guidance was normal. I am sure I missed several radio calls from ATC as we were resolving our issues. At this time things were back to normal and the First Officer accomplished an uneventful visual approach to 24R.,B737NG Captain reported executing a go-around after encountering wake turbulence on short final at LAX in trail of a B767.

In less than a minute; we smelled it in the cockpit. We donned the O2 masks and ran the Smoke/Fumes checklist. [Advised ATC] and received clearance to return to ZZZ. Shortly into the checklist; the flight attendants in the back called again to say they were still getting the strong effects of the electrical odor. We landed ZZZ; and taxied to the gate to deplane.,A320 flight crew reported flight attendants detected fumes on climbout; returned to departure airport.

We were on our flight planned route flying south bound at 33;000 feet at Mach .84 with a 1 mile right offset. I had relieved the Captain 5 minutes before the event. The Captain had requested climb from ATC from 33;000 feet to 35;000 feet and was told to stand by before departing flight deck. ATC cleared us to 'climb and maintain FL350.' After the First Officer confirmed clearance with ATC I set 35;000 in altitude window; confirmed '350' with the First Officer and selected the new altitude. The aircraft commenced climb on autopilot and approaching 33;500 feet we received a TCAS traffic advisory followed immediately by TCAS resolution advisory 'DESCEND; DESCEND NOW.' I disengaged autopilot and leveled airplane momentarily before starting descent.After several seconds and barely 100 feet of descent the conflict resolved as the other aircraft passed behind us at 34;000 feet. After re-engaging autopilot and commencing climb to 35;000 feet we heard the other aircraft query ATC about traffic. The First Officer asked ATC to confirm that they cleared us to 35;000 feet which ATC confirmed by saying 'correct.' ATC had no comment regarding traffic conflict. We never acquired the other aircraft visually as we were in IMC. This event occurred because ATC cleared us to climb from 33;000 feet to 35;000 feet with opposing traffic in close proximity at 34;000 feet.,B777 flight crew reported a traffic advisory for converging traffic while in cruise.

I decided to go up front and check on her. When I arrived; she was on the phone with the pilots. When she got off the phone; she showed me her water bottle and it was a milky cloudy substance that had a strange odor I had never smelled before. I advised her that when we land she needed to complete [a report] and call [company operations center]. She said she felt fine and didn't think it was necessary.Later in the flight; the C Flight Attendant went forward so they could let the pilots out to use the lavatory. A few minutes later; I was paged over the PA to come forward. I quickly went to the front to find 2 passengers and the C [Flight Attendant] in the front galley. I saw that the A [Flight Attendant] was laying on the jumpseat. I sat her up and asked if she had any allergies and if she was taking any medicine. She said [drug] and then her eyes rolled back and she fell back again. The C [Flight Attendant] paged for medical assistance and a physician came forward with his medical license card in hand. I verified and allowed him access to [the C flight attendant]. He used the EMK to check vitals and was going to initiate an IV for fluids to help bring her blood pressure down. However; the A [Flight Attendant] came around and was able to talk with the physician. The pilots attempted to establish a patch with [Airborne Medical] but were unsuccessful. The physician recommended that the A [Flight Attendant] remain seated and try to relax for the rest of the flight. We relocated the A [Flight Attendant] to seat 1C and she remained there until we arrived at the gate in ZZZ.The physician remained in close proximity of the A [Flight Attendant] should her condition deteriorate in the remainder of our decent. I asked that the C Flight Attendant begin to close down the forward and aft galley while I went and collected medical notes and gathered relevant information from the A [Flight Attendant] as well. The C [Flight Attendant] and I agreed and advised the pilots that I would remain forward and occupy the 1L inbound jumpseat for landing and the C [Flight Attendant] would occupy the aft jumpseat for landing. The pilots advised that EMS would meet the flight upon arrival.,Flight Attendant reported that another Flight Attendant became ill after consuming a cloudy drinking water.

Shortly thereafter; received ECAM for Eng 1 Reverser fault followed by Anti-Ice Capt Pitot. My ADI displayed the side stick position indicator as if we were on the ground followed by an electrical disturbance in the number one radio. The aircraft cycled into and out of ground mode as indicated by the side stick position indicator cycling on and off inflight. Each time it cycled; I could hear a clicking sound; like an electrical short in my headset. Ran QRH procedures for the reverser and pitot heat. We then [advised ATC] and Dispatch of our plan to return to ZZZ due to Eng 1 Reverser fault. I spoke to the flight attendants and the passengers to advise them of the issue. I gave the flight attendants the TEST and advised not to prep the cabin for an evacuation. On approach; when gear was selected down we received a LGCIU (Landing Gear Control Interface Unit) 1 fault; following the ECAM we continued for an overweight landing at 138.0 lbs with a smooth touchdown and hardly any braking. We referenced the QRH for the LGCIU ECAM before landing. We also referenced the QRH for landing/go around performance numbers. We exited the runway; had the Fire Chief inspect the aircraft for any obvious issues. We then taxied to the gate. Taxiing to the gate; several other lights and ECAM's came up and were entered in to the logbook. At the gate; I phoned the Chief Pilot and  Maintenance Control.,A319 flight crew reported returning to the departure airport due to multiple ECAM warnings accompanied with cycling between air-ground modes immediately after departure.
1601892,201812,0601-1200,US,Air Carrier,Passenger,A320,Initial Approach,,Captain; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Multiengine; Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,Flight Deck / Cabin / Aircraft Event Smoke / Fire / Fumes / Odor,Person Flight Attendant,In-flight,General Physical Injury / Incapacitation,Aircraft,Aircraft,During preflight; I accepted what I believed was a low risk associated with not investigating the link between the horse manure odor coming from both external air conditioning and Pack 1 because I had never experienced or heard of this type of odor being associated with fume events. No one else I spoke to during or after any of these events had ever experienced or heard of this either. Now I know this odor is associated with fume events. In the future; I would not accept an aircraft after a similar series of linked events during preflight without further investigation and correction into the root cause. In this situation; I should have taken the time to pre-plan what to do if Pack 2 produced fume odors during various phases of flight. More generally; I will learn from this experience and incorporate it into risk assessments for accepting deferred maintenance items.The Safety Department should publish de-identified summaries of this and other fume events to allow other crews to learn from this experience as well--particularly that this type of smell can exist.The Safety Department should follow up with the flight attendants to ensure that they receive appropriate medical care and that no disciplinary action is taken against them for calling out sick on the line.[The company] must continue to investigate the causes and prevention of fume events. In particular; the same aircraft had numerous fume events in the several days following this flight. Repeatedly returning this aircraft to service without correcting the root cause is unacceptable.The mechanic attempted to intimidate and interfere with me in the performance of my duties contrary to 14 CFR 91.11 and 121.580; and he refused an opportunity to reconsider and learn from his actions. This indicates his conduct was willful. Mechanics are well-trained and experienced employees held to a high standard. The Company must take disciplinary action against him.Flight Operations Management was not concerned that a mechanic attempted to intimidate and interfere with me; and Management did not provide my requested assistance in expediting transportation to the hospital for the flight attendants. Instead; Flight Operations Management was concerned about whether I had implied liability to passengers; why I had requested ARFF; and whether I was going to be unable to operate my next flight. The Safety Department should discuss with Flight Operations Management the need to provide requested assistance to flight crews dealing with emergencies; and the need to avoid creating undue pressures against flight crews taking the safest course of action.The flight attendants' immediate communication allowed us to correct the problem right away and substantially reduce the severity of the fume event. The First Officer did a great job on this flight; as well as during the entire trip. He completed the abnormal/emergency procedures and communications I delegated to him quickly and correctly so I could focus on landing. Maintenance Control and the other local mechanics took the time to thoroughly discuss the event with me to assist in their troubleshooting. The Captain and First Officer who were scheduled to fly the aircraft next made themselves available to assist us during the aftermath of the event. In particular; the incoming Captain looked after the flight attendants at the gate while I was busy on the jet bridge. All of these personnel should be commended.,A320 Captain reported a fume event on the aircraft resulted in several flight attendants going to a hospital for medical treatment.

He had trouble getting bags in bin and slammed bins. He approached fwd galley asking C Flight Attendant for Band-aid with finger bleeding. The OPS agent came to finish up and I asked him what was going on with this passenger. I was told he was okay; they couldn't smell alcohol on him. He was probably tired from being out with business friends during the night. I voiced my concern of his wobbling; and his very slow movements and drifting off. I was told he was fine. The door was closed. During takeoff; he was loud trying to engage passenger in 1-A who feigned sleep. During service; he continually got up for the forward galley restroom but could not find the door; even trying the cockpit door. I stayed in the galley unless he was sleeping during most of the entire flight for security reasons. The B and C flight attendants were made aware of the situation. He continued his lavatory routine many times. At one point; he was returning to his seat and I heard a thud. He had fallen into the bulkhead row and was picking himself getting back to his seat. I asked if he was ok and he at first didn't respond. I asked again and he mumbled yes. I went back to fwd galley and I turned; he was right there backing me up saying he went to the doctor and had taken codeine and I had no right to ask him anything. I explained that I wanted to be sure he had not injured himself with the fall. He returned to his seat. He then shouted that he wanted my name. I stepped to the aisle and stated [my name]. He wanted my last name which I said we do not give out [last names] but [Company] has that info and knows who is working. He was upset. I turned to my galley and he jumped up and came at me with his phone and snapped my picture. I immediately asked him to delete it. He returned to his seat saying NO. I calmly told him that he cannot take a crew members picture without permission and he needed to delete it or have ground personnel meet the plane when we land. He refused. So I clearly stated; you are making the choice to have someone meet the aircraft because you are refusing to delete the picture. He just sat mumbling. The C Flight Attendant had come forward at that time and saw most of this. She then went back to take care of the cabin. I did tell her I was going to inform the Captain and ask for ground assistance. I did call the Captain; however; at that time; they were being diverted due to runway issues in ZZZ so he told me he would get back to me. I stayed in the galley waiting for the Captain to call. I was cleaning up when this passenger; who had been mumbling and talking most of this time; came up at me again; backing me up saying I was going down the wrong path with him. I firmly told him to sit down. The Captain called and informed the crew of the diversion and ZZZ issues. He asked about the passenger situation. I quickly gave a summary and asked for ground assistance. We diverted to ZZZ1. On landing; this passenger jumped up to get his bags saying he was leaving. Ops met the plane and police were quickly there along with ground Supervisor. I gave a statement to police. We received witness names and numbers along with a statement from a passenger who witnessed this passenger in [departure airport] in the gate area. This was given to police.Stop allowing passengers that are clearly under the influence of something to board. I don't know what else to say. These passengers are allowed and enabled. There should be no arguement or debate. If someone is asking if you have been drinking or taking medication; then it's a pretty good bet your behavior brought attention to you. Flight crew DOES look out for these issues. Our FAR states we cannot let them onboard. WE do not! We bring attention to the OPS agent or Supervisor or; our Captains; and then we are continually told 'they are fine' or 'they will sleep' or 'this is the last flight out'. Someone has to stop allowing this. Deny boarding; and stopenabling this behavior. Alcohol related issues are one of the biggest conversations among crew. [The passengers] expect ENDLESS alcohol. Drugs are unseen and are hard to detect but just as dangerous; and then you mix the two. Something has to be done to stop allowing this without there being serious consequences to the passenger! This situation has shown me just how vulnerable we are. I could have been physically hurt. I was trapped by this man. For the entire flight; I was on the highest alert in my head. My anxiety level hit me after we landed back in base. I am still having anxiety each time I have to file a report. My passengers could have been hurt. My Captain was busy with a last minute flight diversion due to runway issues in ZZZ; and had to acknowledge this situation. This puts everyone in harm's way. This man should NEVER have been ALLOWED on this aircraft. One of the witness statements was that he observed this man in [departure airport] and was shocked he was allowed on the aircraft at the very last minute. 74 people were trapped at 35K with him. I am not Management; I do not get to have a say in how our passengers are handled. I only know I; my crew; and the rest of the passengers are put at risk for the sake of ONE individual.,B737-700 Flight Attendant reported a passenger became enough of an issue that police met the aircraft at destination.

We donned O2 masks and goggles while the relief pilot ran us through the Smoke/Fumes Elimination checklist. Captain flew and I performed PM duties while monitoring the checklist. Relief pilot coordinated with the flight attendants using the TEST memory aid.  I requested priority handling onto the arrival; and we were cleared direct to the FAF for a visual approach to XXC in VMC conditions with light winds. We remained on O2 until after rollout on the runway and determining the smoke had cleared.  We had previously cleared our exit plan with ATC and directed the cabin crew not to initiate an evacuation. ARFF vehicles checked the aircraft for fire and followed us to the gate; where we shut down and asked them to check the cockpit; as the APU would not start; several switches in that vicinity of the overhead panel were very hot; and we were concerned about the smoke returning if power was applied to the aircraft at the gate. After the overhead panel was checked by ARFF personnel and hot spots were confirmed with their thermal imaging; we were cleared to deplane passengers at the gate with electrical power remaining off. We completed a maintenance debrief; were met by Company Operations; and departed after passengers had deplaned.,B767 flight crew reported an electrical smoke/fumes event during arrival emanating from the Captain's panel above the forward window.

While at cruise at 35;000 ATC called and requested that we slow to Mach .76. At that same time; we encountered moderate turbulence. While reading back the Mach .76 call; I requested lower to smooth air. ATC then said that it was smooth at 31;000 but to descend to 33;000 for now. I started descending to 33;000 via level change. When descending through 33;500 ATC then asked if we were on frequency. I replied that we were and he had literally just slowed us and cleared us to descend to 33;000. At that point; the controller said to maintain 35;000 and turn right 20 degrees. I started a climb back to 35;000 and a turn. Realizing the situation and that the automation was not moving fast enough; I clicked off the autopilot and auto thrust and turned and climbed back to 35;000. Once level; ATC seemed confused about the clearance but fortunately we had an additional pilot in the jump seat and we all clearly heard the clearance and call sign. I told ATC that fact and he was extremely apologetic realizing what had happened. During the event; both the jump seater and I noticed on the TCAS that we were within 100 feet of the other aircrafts altitude! At that point; we did not have the other aircraft in sight but shortly after; a [aircraft] went under our nose and left wing. Once clear of traffic; ATC then cleared us lower again and handed us off to the next controller. He again apologized and thanked us for our help. The end result is that we did not get a TCAS RA; but it was a close encounter. I believe had I left the automation on; it would have resulted in a RA or even worse! I also believe that [the other aircraft] did not get an RA either based on the fact that nothing was said about it on ATC.,Air carrier First Officer reported receiving a clearance from ATC that created an airborne conflict. ATC identified the error and issued a new instruction to deconflict.

Under VFR we descended normally for a normal landing on Runway XX. ARFF (Airport Fire Fighting and Rescue) was standing by and reported no visible fire indications. Ops and Dispatch were contacted and briefed on our situation. We shut down both engines with APU running and ARFF conducted an inspection of wheel wells. With no evidence of fire or smoke; we started both engines and returned to gate. All crew and passengers were deplaned normally.,B737 First Officer reported returning to the departure airport due to a wheel well fire warning annunciation at gear retraction.

We were informed that there was smoke in the cabin from an unknown source. Per non-normal guidance; we donned our oxygen masks and established communication. I was Pilot Flying so I maintained aircraft control as the Captain notified ATC of our situation and requested a landing at the nearest suitable airport. Center pointed out [a possible alternate] at 1 o'clock and 60 miles. We were immediately cleared to 8000' and began an emergency descent. The Captain was forced to shed his headset because the oxygen mask would not fit over it. As a result; he used the cockpit speaker to listen and kept hot MIC on.The sounds of breathing made it very difficult to understand what was being said. We deployed the speedbrakes and extended the landing gear (on speed) in order to increase our descent rate and expedite a landing at [the alternate]. I took over the radios while the Captain coordinated with the cabin crew. This allowed me to listen to and understand what ATC was saying. Next; the Captain ran the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Non-normal Checklist. While descending through FL270; we received a call from the cabin that a USB battery device was found to be the source of the smoke. It had been placed in the containment bag and was no longer smoking. They also indicated that the smoke was clearing out from the cabin. We elected to level off near FL250 and await confirmation that the situation was safe. With this confirmation received; we removed our oxygen masks and reviewed the remainder of the [procedure] per QRH guidance. We elected to cancel the [divert]; climb; and continue to [destination]. The Captain gave a PA explaining the situation and that we were continuing to the destination. A non-Company FA (Flight Attendant) was onboard and assisting our Flight Attendants with the situation. Being a fluent Spanish speaker; she also repeated all of the Captain's PAs in Spanish; which was extremely helpful in keeping the customers calm. We asked that [ground personnel] meet us at the gate to inspect the containment bag. Additionally; EMS was requested because one of our FAs had received an injury to her hand while securing the device. A normal landing ensued and our aircraft was escorted to the gate by [ground personnel]. With the device in the aft galley area still secure in the containment bag; we decided to deplane the customers. Once this was accomplished; the Fire Crew tended to the containment bag while EMS attended the injured FA who was treated briefly. We were given the 'all clear' by the Fire Crew and the event was concluded. This situation was successfully handled because of the professionalism and teamwork demonstrated by our crew. Our Flight Attendants (including the other airline FA) reacted quickly and assertively. Because of their actions; this flight had a successful outcome. Our situation was clearly mitigated by the containment bag. Without it; we would have diverted and emergency egressed at [the alternate].Difficulty that we encountered in the cockpit was an inability to communicate clearly with the oxygen masks on. The Captain's mask would not fit over his headset; so it was quickly shed and communication was established by use of the speaker and hot mike. This technique works well in the simulator however; in the airplane; descending rapidly with the landing gear down; there was too much background noise mixed with regulator sounds to allow easy communication. In hindsight; a better technique would have been to not use the speaker; but put the headphones on over the mask straps. Additionally; only using the yoke push to talk interphone switch when speaking would have also reduced the noise level in the cockpit and on the radios.,B737-700 First Officer reported initiating; then terminating a diversion for smoke in the cabin and difficulty with flight deck communication using oxygen masks.

While complying with the QRH procedure for this abnormal condition; the aural master warning sounded for high cabin altitude; with accompanying master warning lights. Cabin altitude was not controllable. We initiated a descent to 10000 feet. We ascertained from the flight attendants that all passengers and crew were OK; and landed uneventfully. Excellent job by FO (First Officer) and the entire cabin crew.,B767-300ER Captain reported losing control of cabin pressure following the failure of the right pack.

They asked if they should reset them; and I told them definitely not to. We checked the cockpit circuit breakers; which were all normal. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them know about the circuit breakers and asked them to pass it along to Maintenance Control. Just prior to descent; we smelled a strong sulfury odor in the cockpit that dissipated after about a minute. We had the same odor a few minutes later. At this point; we thought that it was someone in the lavatory. The flight attendants called us to let us know that they also smelled it; but that there was no one in the lavatory. The smell was gone again shortly; so I told them to keep us informed. By the third time that we had the smell; I asked them to see if someone could have a colostomy bag or if there was an obvious source that could be the cause. They said that the passengers in the front rows of the airplane all thought that someone had bad gas. They checked and said that there was no bag. I asked; but at this point it did not smell like any type of a fire to them. I asked them to try to isolate the location of the smell and to check for smoke. At this point we were about twenty minutes from landing. At about 12;000 feet on the arrival; the flight attendants called to tell me that the odor was strongest at about row 10; there was no obvious smoke; and the passengers in the forward cabin all had their noses covered. They said that they now smelled an electrical burning smell at row 10. I asked if they all agreed with this; and they all did believe it was electrical. I had transferred control of the airplane to the First Officer to fly the arrival and approach as we were now descending through about 8000 feet. We let Approach Control know that we were [requesting priority] and would like to have emergency personnel standing by at the runway to check for any obvious smoke. We were immediately cleared for the approach and cleared to land. I ran the 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes' checklist as we configured for the approach. After we finished the checklist; I quickly informed the flight attendants of what would happen once we landed. We landed and cleared the runway to hold on [the] intersection. I informed the passengers that we were going to have a fire truck inspect the aircraft due to the odor on the airplane out of an abundance of caution. Fire Personnel did an inspection of the aircraft and saw no smoke or hot spots on the aircraft. At this point; we had no odors in the aircraft and had not since we had run the QRH checklist. We asked them to follow us to the gate so that we could deplane the passengers and have them inspect the interior of the aircraft. I made another PA to the passengers to let them know that everything was fine and safe; and that they would see the fire trucks as they followed us to the gate.At the gate; I quickly spoke with Dispatch to let her know what was going on and that I would call back once we had deplaned and inspected the airplane. We deplaned the passengers as I spoke with the Fire Personnel in the jetway; and they said that they still saw no hot spots on the aircraft but would inspect the cabin. At this point; our A Flight Attendant let me know that both of the forward galley circuit breakers had popped at some point and that all of the water had drained out of the potable water tank. The passengers all seemed happy and no one seemed concerned. We saw no evidence of a fire in the airplane and there was no remaining odor. I spoke with my Crew to make sure that they were okay to continue on our next flight and then had a conference call with Dispatch and a Chief Pilot. I also spoke with Maintenance Control to explain what had happened. The aircraft was taken out of service; and I made a logbook entry and stayed with Maintenance until he let me know that Company was sending Mechanics.,B737-800 flight crew reported sulfur and burning electrical odors in the cabin.

I noticed a message on the ND (Navigation Display) that said 'decrease range TCAS.' When I decreased the range on the ND the TCAS showed a TA in yellow. The aircraft was at our altitude climbing very slowly. The target changed to a descend RA. The FO (First Officer) and I followed SOP and complied with the RA. I notified Center that we were deviating from our clearance due to an RA. We descended about 200 feet when I visually acquired the aircraft flying over us. At this point the target was 1000 feet above us according to the TCAS display. When we were clear of conflict; we climbed back to our previously assigned clearance and notified ATC. There were no aural warnings at all from the TCAS system. When we arrived [at our destination]; we wrote up the TCAS. Maintenance repaired the system and it tested good with the 'TCAS system test OK' aural message.,A320 flight crew reported a TCAS malfunction during an airborne conflict situation.

Shortly after; we both felt our throats burning. C Flight Attendant said she also saw smoke inside the lavatory. passenger also seemed paranoid. We called the Captain and notified him of the events.Police met the aircraft and questioned the passenger. Initially passenger lied to the police saying he didn't do anything. Police Officers and TSA came onto the plane looking for evidence and could not find anything. When we deplaned the aircraft we stayed in the gate area while on the phone with Operations. In the gate area; we noticed the passenger shaking the police officers hand and walking away. As he was walking away; he dropped the vape pen on the ground and picked it up. We notified the police and they detained him. The police tested the vape pen and it tested positive for THC (marijuana). The passenger then confessed to smoking in the back lavatory and in the cabin among other passenger. At the time of writing this; my throat is still burning and I have a headache. I do feel a little off and not sure if it is the stress of the event or effects of the THC.,Flight attendants reported misconduct by a passenger who was vaping marijuana on a flight.

We held for 1 hour. All runways were closed and nil to poor braking was reported. After the 1 hour holding delay we were cleared for the approach to ILS10 C. The First Officer and I discussed the situation and our fuel status and our options. We confirmed our plan with dispatch and decided to continue to ZZZ. On the first approach; we were vectored off to give spacing with a heavy international 787. After a delaying vectors we were once again recleared for the approach. We were assigned a speed of 160 knots 15 miles from the runway. We complied. Approximately 1 mile from the field; the Tower instructed us to go around due to loss of separation. We went around and stated we were now in a minimum fuel state and could except no more delays. ATC vectored us back for a second approach. The weather had deteriorated more to 1/2 mile visibility and slush covered runway at reported depth of 1/8 inch completely covered. We opted to perform a flaps 40 Cat 2 autoland per the approach plate. On the second approach at approximately 300 ft. from touchdown; the Tower instructed us to immediately go-around stating the preceding airplane had slid off the runway. We performed a second go around and immediately diverted to ZZZ1. We were at our minimum fuel and decided that was the safest course of action. We did a 3rd low IFR ILS Autoland into ZZZ1 and it was uneventful. We contacted Crew Scheduling about what they wanted us to do. Their first plan was for us to refuel and fly back to ZZZ. We stated that we thought we were close to the end of our duty day. Scheduling then said that they wanted us to sit on the plane and wait for a possible inbound crew then deadhead to ZZZ. The First Officer and I discussed this and decided it was best to get some crew rest at that point due to the long and very difficult flight we encountered. We felt we were extremely exhausted and not functioning with very clear thought process and our communication skills were degraded. We decided that to layover at ZZZ1 was a safer option. We believed that continuing to work in an exhausted state of mind and body would not be beneficial for the airline.,B737-900 flight crew reported diverting following two missed approaches and then calling in fatigued due to the long stressful flight.

As we passed through 10;000 feet; they began to smell an odor of alcohol and nail polish remover that made them feel uneasy. As they came forward to inform the A and C (FWD) flight attendants; these flight attendants confirmed to them that they had a similar feeling on the way to ZZZ; but did not share that with anyone else. I followed our QRH for fume removal and the odor did not dissipate; but remained mild while in cruise for the remainder of the flight. I had the AFT flight attendants come forward to the cockpit and administered oxygen. This had the desired effect and they both started to feel better. I had them stay in the forward galley for the remainder of the flight. As we started our descent into ZZZ1; I asked them to return to the AFT galley and [let] me know if the odor changed in intensity. Within in few minutes; they called to inform me that the smell was intensifying and that they were again becoming disoriented. At this time; the passengers; starting with those seated in the last rows; started to complain about the odor and quickly the rest of the plane began to complain.  I told the flight attendants to leave the AFT galley and to take a seat in the cabin for the remainder of the flight. Hence; they were not in their safety positions on landing.It appears there was deice fluid trapped in the airplane that may have caused the event and as the airplane pitch attitude changed; so did the trap fluid. A review of the deice personnel and their application methods may be prudent to avoid the injection of deice fluid and subsequent trapping inside the airframe.,A320 Captain reported flight attendants experienced headaches and disoriented feelings from noxious odor in the passenger cabin.

Ovens were empty and the source of the odor could not be identified. Both pilots were beginning to smell an odor of smoke in the cockpit; as well. Oxygen masks were donned by both pilots; and Quick Actions Smoke and Fumes procedures performed. Flight attendants called again and advised pilots of difficulty breathing. [Advised ATC] and we returned to ZZZ; which was about 50nm East of our position. Threat and Error Management methods were discussed and employed and task-loading concerns addressed. The first officer became the pilot flying and landed the aircraft in ZZZAn off duty pilot for another airline appears to be the first person to detect odors. He stated he first smelled the odor when engines reached FLEX power during the takeoff roll. Therefore; odors may be associated with high engine power settings.Identify and repair faulty engines or seals. If this occurred during a trans-Atlantic flight; we would not have enough crew oxygen and PBEs (Protective Breathing Equipment) to land safely considering we could be two or more hours from a diversion airport. Should more PBEs be added to our aircraft until fumes incidents are corrected?,A330 Captain reported returning to the departure airport due to fumes in the cabin and cockpit.

We were descending on glide path and configuring for landing when we receive a Traffic Advisory followed by a Resolution Advisory to adjust vertical speed. The other aircraft was located visually at our 9 o'clock and slightly below our altitude on a crossing path. Captain as Pilot Flying disengaged the autopilot and leveled off to comply with the RA. About 5 seconds later; a clear of conflict message annunciated. The other aircraft maneuvered back to final for the other parallel runway. We stabilized the approach; finished configuring for landing and completed the checklist and landed uneventfully.After shutdown; Captain called Tower who provided a phone number for a RAPCON supervisor. The Supervisor was reviewing the event and said it was caused by a late vector from a different controller; who was on a different frequency controlling Runway 34L. The other aircraft was Aircraft Y who had also complied with the RA. The Supervisor mentioned the controller who gave the late vector was experiencing some health issue that prevented him issuing the vector sooner.It appears the controller working Runway 34L momentarily lost the ability to communicate due to a temporary personal physiological event. The last clearance given to Aircraft Y put it on a near collision course with our flight. Fortunately; TCAS did its job.Ensure procedures for vectoring account for the chance of communication breakdown for stuck mics; radio equipment failure or any other possible event; such as a controller being unable to speak for a few moments. Vector should have lateral or vertical clearance built in; just in case.,B737-800 flight crew reported having an airborne conflict which was the result of the Controller not being able to speak due to personal issues.

Line two of the ECAM: Avoid THR Changes. There were no 'to do' statements on the ECAM; so we referenced the QRH. Step 1 said to match the thrust lever position with the actual thrust; in this case idle; then disconnect the auto thrust system. We accomplished this step and I elected to keep autopilot 1 engaged. We received a further clearance to descend to 8000 ft and go direct ZZZZZ. I inserted the direct and pulled for open descent. Step 2 of the QRH did not apply. Step 3 says if engines stalls; go to the engine shutdown procedures. So as a precaution; we found and reviewed this checklist in the QRH. Approaching 8000 ft; it became obvious that the level off would have to be with engine 2 only...the ECAM which we cleared had said Avoid THR Changes. After a brief discussion; we concluded we had a 'degraded engine' and would have to use single engine procedures to fly the ILS XXL into ZZZ. I directed the first officer to [advise ATC] as we were vectored on downwind. I gave control of the airplane to the FO and then called the flight attendants and advised them of the situation making sure they understood it would be a normal landing and we would taxi to the gate. I also quickly told the passengers so no one would be surprised by the emergency vehicles on landing. I took the airplane back; the FO told [ATC] we would need the emergency equipment and asked them to advise [our company] of the situation. All of this occurred very quickly. We descended to 3000 feet and were given vectors for a short approach. I flew the ILS XXL with the No1 engine in idle following single engine approach guidelines. We landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate. The No1 engine ran smoothly at idle the whole time and we shut it down at the gate using normal procedures.,A319 Captain reported the Number 1 engine developed a compressor vane problem and was only producing idle power. The crew landed with Number 1 engine at idle power.

We looked at the Hydraulic Panel on the Forward Overhead Panel and noted ENG 1 LOW PRESSURE light was illuminated. We then looked at our MFD (Multi Functional Display) System on Lower Display Unit and noted quantity in the Hydraulic A system read 21%. I was pilot monitoring and told the First Officer to continue to fly and take over communications while I referenced the QRH. I followed checklist for Hydraulic Pump Low Pressure; which led us to turning off the ENG 1 Hydraulic Pump switch. We continued to monitor the quantity and noted that it was continuing to decrease at a decent rate. I told the First Officer of my intentions to [advise ATC] before the situation deteriorated and he agreed with my assessment. We [advised] ATC and flew direct to ZZZ. I notified Dispatch of our situation and briefed flight attendants. In anticipation of possibly losing System A we reviewed the 'LOSS OF SYSTEM A' QRH checklist. I referenced the Non-Normal Configuration Landing Distance table and asked Dispatch to also provide me a value to check against my calculation; and the values agreed. Again; this was just preparation in case we lost System A.Eventually; our quantity indicated 0%; but we still had good pressure in the system with no other warning or caution lights. Once communications had been completed and QRH checklists run and reviewed; I again took over ATC communications. We briefed the approach and again reviewed our plan if we lost system A. Except for indicating no quantity in system A; but still with good pressure; we had a normal descent and approach. We lowered gear and flaps earlier than we would normally; considering the possibility that the increased demand on the system could lead to a loss of pressure. When we lowered the gear; we noted quantity increased to 20%; where it stayed for the entirety of flight. We had an uneventful landing and taxi into the gate. We debriefed with local Maintenance. We also debriefed our performance. We felt we maintained safety; managed the emergency well; followed standard procedures; communicated and considered possibilities if the situation deteriorated and how we would handle those situations.,B737 Captain reported main hydraulic system malfunction during cruise.

Approximately 3-5 minutes later the Captain called to ask if we had noticed a rapid descent. We confirmed that we had noticed a change in cabin pressure because our ears had popped. The Captain said we had just experienced a depressurization but the cabin altitude never got high enough for the masks to drop and they decided not to deploy them manually or make a public address to inform the passengers what was going on. In this the Captain assumed we were fine because we had not figured out we were experiencing hypoxia.Several minutes later all 7 crewmembers were experiencing various symptoms of hypoxia. Taking all of this into account I decided it would be advisable to administer oxygen. Flight Attendant 5 contacted the flight deck to advise them that we had used an O2 bottle and get clarification on what was going on. The Captain took the initiative to contact paramedics to meet us at the gate. It was also in that moment that the Captain told us we 'shouldn't be experiencing these symptoms;' giving us the impression that he was negating our symptoms.Upon our arrival into ZZZ we discovered further miscommunication occurred when the paramedics gave us the impression they were told to expect many passengers being ill and that we had experienced a rapid decompression. The Captain then pulled all of us aside for a discussion of what had happened. He then explained that an air conditioning pack had overheated and went inoperative. He said that the remaining air conditioning pack was failing to keep the cabin pressure pressurized and that they were alerted to don O2 masks when the cabin pressure reached 10;000 feet. He said the cabin pressure never got above 12;000 feet and that's why the masks never dropped. He then told us the event was called a 'controlled loss of cabin pressure'. An abrupt departure from his earlier term of 'depressurization.'4 of the 7 crew members chose to be evaluated by paramedics and declined transport to a hospital. The concern of the entire cabin crew was that the flight deck failed to inform us of what was going on when it was occurring and chose to wait until several minutes after the fact to let us know what happened. Our concern lies in the fact that in failing to inform us of what was happening we were not given the opportunity to take appropriate measures; such as being seated or donning oxygen as a precautionary measure. Additionally; the crew is concerned that in reporting our symptoms; the Captain's words and actions invalidated our concerns by telling us 'that shouldn't be happening'. Additionally; the crew is concerned that this is the 3rd reported cabin pressure issue with this particular tail number [in four months] and that this tail is still in service. We cannot perform our functions as safety professionals if we are not properly communicated with by the flight crew and are allowed to work on an aircraft that has known pressurization issues.,Flight Attendant reported lack of oxygen and a feeling of hypoxia and that the pilot advised that they; 'shouldn't be experiencing these symptoms.'

When I looked up my forward window was completely shattered. We ran the QRH; called Dispatch and [Maintenance]. We decided our best option was to turn around and head back to ZZZ. After running the QRH; I handed the aircraft to my First Officer and had him fly the remainder of the flight due to my limited visibility. We notified ATC and [advised them] and told the controllers we wanted to turn back to ZZZ; slow down and descend to 10;000 in case of loss of pressurization. I believe we were still with Center.I briefed the flight attendants we had a mechanical situation and to prepare the cabin for landing and they had 25 minutes to touchdown and it would be a normal landing and we would be returning to a gate. I briefed the passengers and asked for [their patience] and cooperation to get the cabin ready. When ATC handed [us] off [to] Approach we told them we need XXL for landing; since our gate was located on the north side of the airport. I did not want to taxi across the airport with limited visibility.Despite [being] an emergency aircraft Approach was NOT helpful. They wanted us to land on Runway XY; which we replied that was not an option. They want to know why [we] couldn't accept XY and we told them operational. We landed on XXL; taxied to the gate without any further problems. The flight attendants did a great job.,B737 flight crew reported the Captain's side windshield cracked in flight.

No fire warnings were observed. Engine #2 indication showed a wind-milling engine with no EGT. ATC was notified and [advised]. Engine Failure Checklist was run and flight attendants; passengers; and Dispatch were notified via ACARS. Vectors to an ILS XXR were flown to a successful overweight landing. Taxiway E was used to stop the aircraft for inspection from the fire trucks. No fire or unsafe conditions existed so we taxied to gate. Maintenance report was documented. [Chief Pilot]; Dispatch; Maintenance; and flight attendants were all debriefed.,B737 flight crew reported engine #2 failure after departure resulted in a return to departure airport for landing.

I thought I had the traffic visually; but wasn't sure; so I responded 'searching.' I looked at the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) display; but there wasn't a target where I thought the traffic should be. At approximately 7;000 feet; we got a Resolution Advisory telling us to descend; followed by another telling us to increase descent rate. The FO (First Officer) complied with the RA (Resolution Advisory) and performed the descending maneuver. The TCAS display showed an aircraft right on our nose within 100 feet vertically. I called ATC and informed them we were descending in response to an RA. We descended approximately 1;000 feet during which time the TCAS continued to command a descent. After that 1;000 feet; the TCAS commanded Climb/Climb Now. The FO complied with the climb RA command. The target on the display continued to show an aircraft on our nose within 100 feet; and we began to realize that our TCAS system was more than likely malfunctioning. I switched the transponder XPNDR and ALT SOURCE both to '1' (they had been both in '2') and the displays returned to normal. I informed ATC that it was likely an aircraft malfunction we were responding to; and he confirmed that he did not observe any traffic in our immediate vicinity and altitude. We continued the flight in system 1 with no other issues.,B737-800 flight crew experienced erroneous TCAS alerts during climbout due to apparent equipment malfunction.

We immediately donned our oxygen masks and established communication. We then notified ATC of our problem and leveled off at FL 220. The captain ran the QRC and QRH while I flew the aircraft. We noticed the cabin altitude was stable at 15;000 feet; although this was neither an explosive or rapid decompression we clearly had a pressurization problem with only partial pressurization; so we [advised ATC] and descended to 10;000 feet. We then requested a turn back to ZZZ and finished our checklist and requested overweight landing data as we would be 800 pounds over max landing weight. We did a normal flaps 30 landing followed by normal brake application. After turning off the runway we had the [ARFF personnel] do an inspection of our landing gear for any hot brakes. After getting the all clear we proceeded to the gate and deplaned. The maintenance technician then advised us of a failed one way check valve in the external ground air receptacle which was the cause.,B737 flight crew reported a pressurization issue led to a return to the departure airport.

The entire crew arrived early; (1 hour prior to departure) introduced ourselves; and talked about the flight. We briefed security; weather; MELs; and most importantly safety. Boarding was uneventful. The weather in ZZZ1 was a 1/4 sm and VV002. We asked Dispatch for an ALT as there wasn't one on our release. We also had to remove an additional MEL on our release that was previously cleared by Maintenance. We ended up leaving 13 minutes late waiting for a printed out 2nd release. Pushing back I asked my First Officer (FO) to start engine Number 1. He started engine Number 1 while I monitored the push and talked to the ground crew. The FO immediately brought to my attention the large plume of smoke coming from the engine during the start sequence. All engine parameters were within limits. After the start there were no unusual smells or indications. We attributed the smoke to a possible over-spray of deice fluid onto the engine (not uncommon); as well as it was the first flight of the day; and it was cold outside. We taxied out on 1 engine per suggested procedures via spot XX to runway 34R. In sequence for takeoff engine Number 2 was started and the APU was shutdown. We ran all appropriate checklist. There were no abnormal instrument indications. There were no fumes or unusual odors prior to flight. I was the Pilot Flying this particular leg. Taking off Runway XXR was uneventful until acceleration altitude. Shortly after I brought the thrust levers back from takeoff to climb detent; I noticed an unusual smell. It was very light at first. I asked my FO if he could smell anything. He initially couldn't smell anything different than normal. We were extremely busy on the departure and cleaning up the aircraft. We were handed off to Departure and were told to make a left turn which was opposite of the departure procedure. It was somewhere around this time that my First Officer told me that he could smell something as well. It was faint at first and not distinguishable. The odor grew stronger and began to irritate my throat. If I had to choose it was more chemically than the musty sock smell. I had my First Officer don his O2 mask and call the back to see if they had anything unusual to report. I continued to fly the plane and was handling the radios. I turned the AP1 on at this time to reduce the workload and focus on the fume problem. The Flight Attendants (FAs) had nothing to report. We told them to let us know if anything changed. We began to troubleshoot the problem turning the bleed fans to high. It seemed to me that the smell was dissipating as time progressed. Initially I thought it was one of those smells that come and go just as fast. A good example of this is a familiar smell flying through the thin layer going into ZZZ2. We had FA B come forward to the cockpit to give us a second opinion on whether the odor was still lingering. When she came upfront she immediately noticed the smell. I had a conversation with her I'm a bit foggy as to everything she or I said. I do remember FA B saying it hurt her throat. She left the cockpit and I donned my O2 mask. I don't recall the exact amount of time or altitude this all transpired as we were obviously busy and the aircraft was light and climbing fast. I did occasionally remove it for a few seconds to see if the smell dissipated. After FA B left; we discussed the QRH and whether or not to return to ZZZ. My throat was pretty sore; I felt light headed; and we both had O2 mask on. The safest thing to do was return to ZZZ. The First Officer made the request to ATC [and] they gave us an altitude and heading. They asked if we were requesting priority handling. My First Officer acknowledged with FOB; SOB; and the nature of our situation. I called the back and told our Flight Attendants that we [notified ATC] and were returning to the field because of the fumes in the cockpit. I was talking through the O2 mask and I believe I said there weren't going to be any PAs explaining everything to the passengers from us. The FO called the company enlightened them on our situation and got us a gate. I was pretty foggy at this point even with the O2 mask on. My throat hurt and I was coughing. My First Officer conveyed that he felt better than I did and offered to be Flying Pilot. I transferred controls to my FO to be the Flying Pilot. ATC gave us direct ZZZ and eventually cleared us to land for Runway XXR. I ran the checklist and handled the radios. The First Officer did a flawless approach and landing. We exited the runway and taxied at a steady pace to spot XX and cleared to gate XX. Arriving at the gate we had no rampers and the spot was blocked by a row of baggage carts. I had both engines running and every light on to hopefully get everyone's attention. Still having my oxygen mask on I opened my window stuck my head out and waved rapidly at the rampers at the next gate over. They saw me and quickly came over to clear the area and parked us. We pulled in and shut down. Ran the checklist and opened the cockpit door. The emergency crews were already there. We collected our bags and followed the paramedics to the gate area where they evaluated us. The three of us all went to the hospital for further evaluation. We all tested positive for high CO levels in our blood. Looking back at the event; it seemed to me a few times that the odor was dissipating or gone. I felt that the conditions were the most toxic shortly after I reduced thrust from takeoff thrust. I realize today that I was completely acclimated to the odor and what I was sensing was inaccurate. Unlike an engine indication or a warning light there is no way for a pilot to definitely determine that the problem still exist with this particular fume event. I remember looking at the QRH saying 'but the odor is decreasing.' I've had several 'fume events' at this airline and each one unlike the first. The Flight Attendants did an excellent job. They understood the severity of the situation and passed the necessary information along quickly. We called them several times and they were very straight to the point and factual. When the cockpit door opened on the ground and we exited the aircraft not one passenger was standing. Without a doubt they had positive control on the cabin. FA B coming forward in helping us asses the cockpit fumes was crucial. She remained calm; told us the conditions in the back; and immediately went into what she smelled and how it was affecting her. I lastly want to commend my First Officer. He offered several solutions as what he thought the problem was. My FO did all that he could to keep the workload down and assist me as well as reminded me if something was missed. We did deal with the situation together. We were lucky that we had flown with each other for the last 3 days and understood one another. We kept the cockpit communication open and flowing. Finally after deciding to return to ZZZ my First Officer realized the condition I was in and offered to assume control of the aircraft. I agreed with him as that was the best decision. He has good character; makes the right decisions under pressure; and is a pleasure to fly with. He will make an excellent Line Captain. Maintenance returned the aircraft back to service after performing the cabin air troubleshoot form. They discovered deice fluid on the APU inlet. They deactivated the APU and returned to flight where the next crew had another fume event. I disagree with Maintenance's solution to the problem. We did not have the APU running when we had the problem for one. Secondly the chemical smell that I experienced wasn't the typical deice smell. Does boiling deice fluid produce CO? I'm not sure? I've had fume events before and the air filters were replaced. I see nothing in this report that the filters were checked or replaced. I've heard countless remarks from Maintenance on the line that we are using different oil in our APU and not changing ourair filters regularly. What happened to the carbon filters that we were getting? What happened to Maintenance running the bleed on the ramp to high temperatures for burn off procedures like [other airline]? This is my 3rd fume event. This is too common of an occurrence and the only way to prevent this is by actually cleaning the bleed systems; changing the air filters regularly; and tracking the aircraft fume events between airlines.,A320 flight crew reported strong fumes during initial climb and experienced health issues. Executed a return to departure airport.

During takeoff flight deck door inadvertently opened. I was working C position and strapped into my jumpseat. When this event happened. I quickly turned and attempted to shut [the] door even though it was physically impossible to do so at takeoff speeds and initial climb ( being it is a steel reinforced door and extremely heavy at that point during flight). I did my best at what I was trained to do; protecting flight deck from a possible breach; while holding the door closed to a point until I could get out of my jumpseat to actually close it. In the process; I was hurt by the strain on my left side of my body (arm; shoulder and neck) at that particular angle being strapped in for my safety during takeoff. I did not know the extent of my injury until a few hours later as my neck and shoulder region began to swell up due to the strain. I did seek medical treatment via company afterwards later in the day as my trip was over. Our B flight attendant claimed that this was not the first time experiencing the MAX 8 door inadvertently opening during takeoff. This was my first experience. My concern is are people reporting this. Is this a possible problem with the MAX 8. I personally can not claim human error or equipment problem. But worth investigating to ensure safety of flight crew as this could be a possible security breach in the worst case scenario. There is no protocol for an inadvertent flight deck door opening during takeoff in our manual; so I did what I instinctively knew. protect flight deck from a possible breach. In the meantime I did get hurt in this event as it is truly difficult to close that door at takeoff while strapped in the forward jumpseat. I want to bring light to this subject in what is the right thing to do in this event.,B737 MAX Flight Attendant reported incurring a minor injury while attempting to close the flight deck door when it opened during takeoff.

The CA (Captain) queried her for more specifics (related to identifying type of odor) and they agreed to monitor for changes. The CA and I reviewed the 'odors' flight ops bulletin and discussed the potential of a developing fumes event. After a few minutes the 'A' reported an increase in intensity with eye irritation. We decided that this was likely a fumes event and proceeded to run the 'fumes' checklist from the QRH; selecting Pack 2 off as we had no indication or any fumes in the cockpit. We also advised Dispatch of a potential need to divert and discussed ZZZ or ZZZ1 as possible choices. Dispatch advised ZZZ as closest (which we already knew). After the required 5 minute interval the CA queried the FA and she reported the condition had worsened. We then switched pack configuration per the QRH with Pack 2 on and Pack 1 off. Just before that 5 minute interval ended the FA reported continued worsening with fumes now affecting the passengers in the first few rows of the cabin. We made the decision to divert to ZZZ. The CA advised ATC. As I was already the Pilot Flying the CA had me continue as such and gave me the radio communication duties as well so that he could coordinate better handle the growing non-flying duties. ATC gave us priority handling and the remainder of the descent and landing was uneventful. Emergency equipment was offered and I accepted as well as requesting EMTs to be waiting at the gate. After landing we decided the fumes were not at a critical level so we continued to clear the runway and proceeded to the gate. We had not received any gate confirmation and were unable to contact station ops on the radio so the CA decided to proceed to our 'normal' gate and after a few minutes delay station personnel arrived. We asked all passengers to deplane and the EMTs met/treated FAs and passengers as needed. We at no time noticed any fumes on the flight deck during the entire event. Suggestions: fume event as described. We diverted to a low use station and were lucky station personnel happened to be there. Dispatch should have offered more suggestions for possible divert choices based on operational factors other than closest airport. In hindsight; ZZZ1 was probably a better choice and not any further away (time wise) as we were too high/close to descend straight in to ZZZ. Also; we were unable to contact station ops once on the ground. In my experience; this has been an ongoing system wide systemic problem and in my opinion one day our collective luck will run out.,A320 flight crew reported Flight Attendant informed them of acrid odor in the forward cabin area. Flight crew executed a diversion due to fumes intensifying.

We had a flap disagree situation and while running the checklist we were able to move the flaps to 10 but that was where it stopped. We ended up using the alternate flaps checklist and landed with flaps 15. It was an uneventful landing and we taxied to the gate.,B737 flight crew reported a Flap Disagree on approach; used Alternate Flap extension and landed without incident.

Almost simultaneously at the rotate callout; there was a load bang heard just beneath the flight deck. First Officer (Pilot Flying) suspected a nosewheel tire blowout and elected to leave the landing gear down. Pilot Monitoring asked Tower if there was debris on the runway and they did confirm there was tire debris on the runway. We received vectors to the west and were assigned to hold at BLOND to burn fuel and to discuss a plan of action.We took off with 36;400 pounds of fuel; so we had over 20;000 pounds of fuel to burn to be under maximum landing weight. With the landing gear down; flaps 5 at 6;000 feet and 230 knots; it would have taken over 2 and a half hours of holding to burn the fuel. While holding; we discussed our plan with Dispatch to return to ZZZ. We elected to conduct a low approach at ZZZ to see if the Tower could verify which tire had failed; however; they were unable to see which tire had failed. We then returned to holding at BLOND to finalize our plan and to burn more fuel. In agreement with the Dispatcher and the [Chief Pilot]; we elected to accept an overweight landing on [Runway] 1L at ZZZ.  The plan was to make a full stop on the runway and have Crash Rescue assess the status of the aircraft and to have the aircraft towed from the runway to prevent any further damage to the nose gear or engines. The Captain (Pilot Monitoring) elected that he would land the aircraft due to the potential for loss of directional control since he had the tiller. The landing weight of the aircraft was 136;300 pounds and was an uneventful landing to a full stop with no loss of directional control. Crash Fire Rescue initially stated that they did not see anything wrong with the tire; however; we asked them to take a close look; at which time they noticed the right main tire was missing the tread. At this time; we shut down the engines and were towed from the runway to the pad where the passengers were offloaded onto buses and returned to the terminal. Upon inspection; the failed tire caused damage to some support brackets and wiring on the aft side of the nosewheel and the undercarriage of the aircraft had several dents from the tread that came off.,B737-700 flight crew reported a failure of their nosewheel on takeoff.

Shortly after that the FAs called and said a passenger had gotten sick. At that point we [notified ATC]; informed ATC that we wanted to divert to ZZZ1. We called ZZZ1 station OPS and informed them that we were diverting to ZZZ1. On approach the FAs informed us that the smell had diminished. Approach and landing (overweight) was uneventful. Emergency equipment met the aircraft as we taxied clear of [runway]. The Emergency Crew Captain wanted to deplane while the aircraft was still on the taxiway. We asked them to walk around the plane and if they saw any leak we would deplane on the taxiway. They saw no leaks so we taxied to gate and waited for marshallers to arrive to marshal us to the gate. After parking at the gate; Maintenance informed us that there was a fuel leak from the center fuel tank.,B737 flight crew reported fuel odor in cabin and resulting passenger illness.

Checked the status page and the C HYD quantity was dropping quickly. Turned off the C HYD pumps without the checklist in attempt to stop the leak. Requested to level at 19;000 to diagnose. F/O [First Officer] took the flying and ATC duties and I worked with the IRO to accomplish checklists. The C HYD SYS PRESS EICAS was now illuminated. ATC was advised of our problem and provided delaying vectors. [Notified ATC.] We began with the C HYD QTY checklist; which was the initial alert we had gotten. That directed us to the to the C HYD SYS PRESS checklist. We read and accomplished that checklist. We concluded that continuing to ZZZ1 was not practical and a return was necessary. Dispatch contact was first via ACARS to quickly tell him of our loss of the C HYD SYS and our thoughts to return for landing. We also told him of our plan to dump about 10;000 lbs of fuel. Then a phone patch was established and we discussed all of the previous and perhaps landing at ZZZ2 for a longer runway. ZZZ XXL landing distance was only 8207 ft and the wind was a slight quartering tailwind when we took off. Dispatcher provided landing data for 22L [and] XXR. ATC offered XXR with the full ILS. With a calculated required landing distance of 5800 ft and XXR having 9560 ft available the winds were now a headwind the decision was made to land ZZZ XXR. Permission was given from Center to dump fuel. Dispatch was notified and we ran the fuel dumping checklist. Flight Attendants were now advised of the emergency. During the test briefing I told them a normal landing was planned and not to prep for evacuation but mentally review the procedures. The passenger announcement was now made. When the decision was made to return to ZZZ; [Center] ATC cleared us to hold at intersection on the ZZZZZ Arrival. We held for approximately another hour and a half to burn around 21;000 lbs of fuel to reach max landing weight of 350;000 lbs. During the hold time; Dispatcher continued to provide us with the necessary support by arranging emergency equipment; ATC priority and ZZZ Operations coordination. While in holding we reviewed the checklists several times and numerous check-in's were made with the flight attendants. At least one additional PA announcement. Left the hold at 350;000 lbs and accomplished the alternate gear and alternate flap extension checklists. A normal landing was made and with the reserve brakes and steering we were able to easily make the turnoff under our own power and taxi to gate. After block in a full cockpit and cabin crew debrief was performed. The deplaning passengers were very understanding and supportive of the safety decision to return. This flight attendant crew under the Purser XX_33 XX_21 was outstanding from the onset. It was their caring and attentive attitude that lead to a calm and cooperative demeanor of the passengers. This crew is a fine example of the true spirit the company strives for. A maintenance debrief was conducted. The technicians said the ADP was leaking. They asked us if we had conferenced with [Maintenance]. I had not considered this option because I felt that the loss of the C hydraulic SYS was a clear situation that continued ETOPS flight was not an option and the written checklists were precisely all the guidance we needed to conduct a safe flight. I debriefed only with the [Chief Pilot] as the Dispatch shift had changed. However; the Pilot/ Dispatcher communication and cooperation was textbook and exactly as you would expect it to be handled. In retrospect there are several takeaways for me from this experience. First is the false sense of time available. In our training environment; time and fuel are always critical resources. Usually once an emergency happens; it is resolved and you are back on the ground within 45 minutes. In this emergency we had just departed and the amount of fuel we had; created excess time available. There was no urgency to land or make hasty decisions. Despite this fact; I still think the mindset was to accomplish all tasks ASAP. As a result of this misconception; I think I chose to dump fuel early thinking it would expedite the landing. When in fact after the dump we still had to burn 20;000 lbs. I think a better decision would have been to hold off on this checklist and perform it at a later time and perhaps a different location. I still believe dumping the fuel was the right thing to do. It saved another hour of airborne holding which may have reduced some anxiety that the passengers may have been feeling. That all being said; everything did go like a training scenario. We all felt prepared and comfortable with the checklists and the duties required of us. This is truly a credit to our training center and all of the dedicated individuals who selflessly teach and help to maintain our flying skills every year. Thank you.,767 flight crew reported a hydraulic system failure and the steps taken to get the aircraft on the ground safely.

On climb out of ZZZ; at 14;000 feet; the stabilizer started bumping the nose of the aircraft up and down slightly. It continued up to FL 240. We were indicating 284k per the FMC and there was no movement with the yoke. I disconnected the auto pilot and bumping of the nose up and down continued. I felt no movement within the flight controls. I turned back on the auto pilot. The bumping was consistent with regular intervals of around 1 to 2 seconds. It was not turbulence that was causing the bumping to occur. My FO (First Officer) and I were uncomfortable with continuing the flight. I notified ATC and requested rescue vehicles upon landing. We leveled off at FL 250; I slowed the aircraft to 250k and the bumping stopped. I handed the aircraft over to my FO. I took at the QRH to see if there was a check list for our flight condition. I call Operations (we were still in radio range) and told them we had an emergency and to please contact my Dispatcher. I called and briefed the lead FA (Flight Attendant) and made a PA to the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZ. I took the aircraft back from my FO and proceeded back the ZZZ. My FO sent the logbook entrees to maintenance via ACARS. We continued to ZZZ at 250k with no further issues and made a safe over weight landing. Maintenance met us at the gate and was briefed. I call my dispatch and briefed them and also briefed two [Flight Operations Managers] on the phone.,B737 Captain reported vertical bounce during climb.

The cabin called us to report fumes in the aft galley. The FA (Flight Attendant) reported that she had followed her procedure for such an event which included shutting down the galley and pulling the CB in the aft galley. I said call me back in a minute and let me know if it clears. She called back almost immediately and told me that the fumes were getting worst and that it smelled like burning plastic. My FO (First Officer) and I immediately donned our O2 masks and followed the procedure for 'Smoke.' I complied with the emergency procedure while the FO (PF; Pilot Flying) [notified ATC]. ZZZ was the closest suitable airport; so we requested an immediate descent and vectors for an approach into ZZZ. Late in the descent; the FA's reported that the fumes had diminished somewhat. We landed at ZZZ. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) approached the aircraft and after checking the cargo holds; could not determine the source of the fumes.,A321 flight crew reported divert due to Flight Attendant notification of smoke and fumes in the aft galley.

We called dispatch immediately and had a phone patch to [Maintenance Control] to discuss the issue. The oil pressure continued to drop during our roughly 3 minute discussion. Based on our current position; we all agreed the safest and most prudent course of action was to divert back to ZZZZ. The First Officer immediately called for the 2 Relief Officers; who were currently on break; to return to the cockpit. Everyone was briefed on the situation; as we had already turned back to ZZZZ. We informed the Purser of the issue and asked they begin picking up all trays and secure the cabin for landing in approximately 55 minutes. We also informed the passengers of our return to ZZZZ because of the situation. As we continued toward ZZZZ; the oil pressure continued to drop. We then [advised ATC] with ZZZZ1 ATC as it was becoming apparent we would eventually be shutting down the left engine; wanting priority handling to ZZZZ. We also began dumping fuel; which took 31 minutes to complete; to get us below an overweight landing situation. When the right engine pressure dropped to 14; we elected to disarm the left auto throttle and bring it to idle. We descended to FL240. Within 3 minutes of descending; the oil pressure was reading 9; the oil quantity was 0; [using] the ECL [Electronic Checklist] [for] the Engine Shutdown Checklist. We shut the left engine down as per the checklist. The Purser was notified of the current situation (TEST) and prepared the cabin as necessary. We asked ZZZZ Center to coordinate fire trucks at the airport for our return. We briefed an ILS to [Runway] 16R single engine auto land approach. We landed in ZZZZ without incident; taxied to a hardstand gate and deplaned passengers to buses. The ZZZZ Aviation Authority came on board the aircraft; asked us to write an incident report and took photos of our licenses and medicals before releasing us to leave the aircraft. I spoke directly with the [Maintenance Control] and Dispatch just prior to ZZZZ authorities boarding the aircraft; recapping the entire incident. [We] debriefed with our local mechanics of the engine issue and parameters we encountered prior to shutting down the left engine before leaving the aircraft and returning to the hotel. The incident began 53 minutes into the flight. We were back in ZZZZ in less than 1 hour after the incident began.,B777 flight crew observed low oil quantity and shutdown engine and returned to departure airport.

The Captain (PM; Pilot Monitoring) called for a go-around which I executed and we informed Tower we had a gear problem. I continued the go-around; leaving the gear extended and accelerated and called for the flaps to be retracted to 1. I maintained 170 KIAS and climbed to 3;000 turning to a southeasterly heading (130?) as directed by Tower. I reengaged the autopilot and took over ATC radios as the PM Captain began running the ECAM. Running the ECAM basically entails recycling the gear which was unsuccessful. We then proceeded to the L/G Gravity Extension checklist. This checklist basically involves turning the gear hand crank 3 turns to the mechanical stop. This was also unsuccessful. I reached down and verified the hand crank was at the stop.At this time; we initiated a 'Dispatch Call me' and the Captain began discussing options with Dispatch and [Maintenance Control]. During this; I inquired about fuel (I think we had about 6;200 LBS) and we decided we would burn down to 4;000 prior to landing. I also coordinated a flyby of the tower so they could see the gear. During that flyby; tower said the gear appeared down and straight.I did not hear much of the conversation with Dispatch and [Maintenance Control]; but we then moved to the Landing with Abnormal Gear checklist. The Captain ran this while I maneuvered first in the Tower pattern and then out to an extended final. As the checklist was finishing I mentioned we were getting close to 4;000 LBS; so we decided to take a turn to the runway. Since I had been flying we elected to have me do the landing which basically involves landing and holding off the nose until just prior to loss of elevator authority. We also discussed the need to maintain below 1;000 PSI on the brake pressure during the stop. The checklist also mentions moving passengers aft; but since we were close to full that was not an option.I re-configured normal full flap and landed; holding off the nose and gently lowering it to the runway. The full stop was uneventful.After landing; fire and rescue met us as well as [Company Maintenance]. Upon inspection of the nose gear; Maintenance informed us that it was not over center and they could not put the pin in to be towed to the gate. Initially we were going to put jack the nose up; but that was deemed too dangerous with passengers on board and the relatively gusty wind conditions. We then elected to put a jack under the nose to prevent collapse and deplane the passengers via 2L and air stairs and bus them to the terminal. All this coordination took well over two hours.,A320 First Officer reported landing with an unsafe gear indication.

As a result; a rejected takeoff was immediately accomplished. Once stopped on the runway; the purser notified the flight deck that; just prior to the rejected takeoff; FAs (Flight Attendants) and passengers witnessed flames emitting from the exhaust section of the right engine. Tower was notified; Fire Rescue requested; passengers told to remain seated; and all required checklists completed. The right engine was manually shutdown. Fire Rescue visually inspected the right engine and notified flight deck of no visible damage or fire. A return to the gate was requested along with a Fire Rescue escort. Just prior to gate arrival; Fire Rescue gave all clear and safe to continue. Aircraft stopped prior to turning into the gate and remaining engine was shutdown and the aircraft was towed into the gate. At the gate; a visual inspection of the right engine showed pieces of melted metal in the exhaust section of the engine. Dispatch and [Chief Pilot] were notified and maintenance write-up accomplished. Additionally; Tower was notified of the possibility of engine debris on the runway.,B777 Captain reported rejecting takeoff after right engine surging and vibrations.

He was demanding more liquor and called the purser names. He had shown the threat of physical violence by displaying his pumped up biceps and saying he was going get physical. He  announced the he was a One K; he paid our salaries and would sue us and the airline and have our jobs if he was not served. The purser stated that he felt unsafe and wanted this passenger off the airplane. I felt that at this point it would be better to talk to the purser face to face. I hung up the phone and went to the aft galley where the purser was trying to separate himself from the passenger to deescalate the situation. He repeated the story which was confirmed by an additional flight attendant. While they were relating the story the passenger entered the aft galley. I turned to the passenger and told him he needed to return to his seat. He demanded a 'double whiskey!' I continued to tell him he had a choice to return to his seat or he would force me to divert the aircraft. He demanded a double whiskey and started to bow up and flex his muscles. Fearing a physical escalation the purser grabbed me by the shoulder and moved me away from the passenger. Leaving him with the other two flight attendants in the aft galley. He continued his demands and threats. I returned to the flight deck with the purser and we discussed our options including dispatch on the satellite phone. The consensus was we did not want this to escalate. We coordinated a divert with ATC and dispatch. We dumped approximately 10;000 pounds of fuel. Once the cabin was secured I made an announcement that we were diverting at which time the passenger hid in the lavatory for a period of time. He did return to his seat for landing and left the airplane without incidence with the Port Authority Police.,B777 Captain reported diverting due to a threatening intoxicated passenger.

She reported it was aft service area; aircraft right generally; near the coffee pots. She reported a distinct electrical burning smell; and white smoke. I shut off CAB/UTILITY switch and asked the flight attendants to call us with updates. First Officer ran the Smoke; Fire; or Fumes QRH checklist. We [advised] ATC and requested ARFF meet the aircraft after landing. The flight attendants reported that the smoke and heat was dissipating. This all happened about 8-10 minutes from landing at ZZZ. No further smoke or fumes reported. I briefed flight attendants for a precautionary landing; and made a public address. After landing; we taxied to the gate with ARFF vehicles escorting us. Firefighting personnel came on board after gate arrival and checked aft galley; no unusual heat or smoke found at this point. There was a lingering burnt electrical smell; however; especially when Maintenance personnel opened the ceiling access panel. Flight attendants reported that smoke and burning electrical odor filled aft galley and drifted into the last two rows of main cabin before dissipating. There were no injuries reported. After a lengthy delay in ZZZ; we left the airplane in the hands of Maintenance personnel who were still searching for the cause of the smoke and fumes.,B737-800 flight crew reported Flight Attendant notified them of smoke and heat in the aft galley during descent.

Deadheading crew in the back confirmed a burning smell with no smoke. Thought it was coming from the entertainment system. Captain asked the Flight Attendant to turn off the entertainment system and see if it went away. Waited a few minutes and said the fumes still [were] there. At this time a passenger moved because she said she felt ill. Diverted to ZZZ1; Captain gave control to me; while he ran [the] checklist. I flew aircraft into terminal area. Once all checklists where complete and the Captain and I formulated complete game plan; the Captain took back control and flew an uneventful visual straight-in to XXR. Taxied clear; looked over by [emergency crew]; taxied to gate.,B737-800 First Officer reported burning fumes in the passenger cabin which resulted in a diversion.

They reported that the smell was stronger than they had experienced in the past but reported no smoke. I was going to go on break soon; so the Captain sent me to the cabin to assess the situation. Around row 18; I started noticing a strong electrical burning smell. One of the passengers reported seeing a flash above row 18 right before the smell started. I returned to the forward galley to talk to the Captain using the inter-phone. While telling him what I had observed; I thought it looked hazy in the back. I asked the Purser if he thought it looked hazy and he said 'It does look a little hazy.' I informed the Captain that we observed some haze and that I wanted to take one more look. I wasn't able to gather new information; so I went back up to the flight deck. We all discussed it and the decision was made to return to ZZZZ. While the Flying First Officer started the divert back to ZZZZ; the Captain directed me to finish the Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist. He said he had completed the first 5 steps; so I reviewed the first 5 steps to ensure they had been done. We discussed the issue of oxygen masks but decided it would have been a larger threat to communication by donning them; with no evidence of smoke in the cockpit; than not donning them. After finishing the smoke fire or fumes checklist; the Captain directed me to accomplish the Overweight Landing Checklist as we had decided not to dump fuel. I accomplished that checklist and figured the performance limit weight and required landing distance using the performance tab in the QRH. A few times on the descent we received an R HYD SYS LOW PRESS and BRAKE SOURCE EICAS messages. We determined the right hydraulic system had pressure and appeared to be operating normally and reviewed the BRAKE SOURCE QRH even though it ultimately was not needed. Once the non-normal checklists were completed; we gave the flight attendants a briefing and made a PA to the passengers. After completing all remaining checklists; we landed normally in ZZZZ.,B767 First Officer reported being notified by flight attendants of burning smell in passenger cabin.

I (Flight Attendant 1) walked thru the cabin and detected a smell row 8 thru wing area and again in rear galley. I called the Captain and reported [it]. Flight Attendant 2 walked thru cabin and also smelled odor but could not describe. I asked Dead heading pilot to walk thru cabin and he confirmed [the] dirty sock smell. Called Captain again and updated. Captain stated they performed a function to pull air thru/out of the cabin. The Captain called back to ask if had improved? We were strapped in jumpseats for landing (3-4 min out) so; could not confirm. Aircraft was met by firemen and a Mechanic.

Takeoff was smooth with no other indications so we continued. On climb out we were told that ZZZZ found rubber on the runway. At this time we checked the hydraulic page and found the A side leaking. We ran our checklists. Coordinated with Dispatch; FAs (Flight Attendants); and Maintenance. Upon reaching ZZZ1 Center we [requested priority handling] and coordinated with ATC. We manually extended the gear and did a low pass down the runway. We were told by the Fire Chief that our left inboard tire looked damaged. The normal gear indications did not show the left main down. The overhead panel did. We came in for a normal landing and smoothly touched down. [Captain] said his brakes were mushy; so I joined home on the brakes. Mine worked fine. We stopped on the runway and shut the engines down. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) came into inspect us and Maintenance pinned the gear. We were towed to the gate.,B737-800 First Officer reported a failure in the anti-skid system resulting in a blown tire.

Departure from RWY 26L at ZZZ and flew SID with approved deviations to avoid buildups to the Northwest. At approximately [time] EDT; just after leveling off at 33K' and NNE of ZZZZZ; CABIN ALTITUDE warning light came on with audible horn and cabin altitude climbing through 10K'. We donned oxygen masks; established communications; and Captain pulled out the QRC to run the Cabin Altitude Warning checklist. As the cabin altitude continued to rise past towards 12K'; we [notified] ATC (ZZZ Center) and initiated a descent to 10K' and continued with QRC procedures. During descent we turned west toward the shoreline; asked for current/forecast weather conditions and decided to divert to ZZZ1. Captain continued to run the emergency checklist referencing the QRH from the iPad. After cabin altitude was indicating below 10K' we took oxygen masks off. After approximately 5-10 minutes with the masks off; I felt some 'hypoxia like' symptoms and told the Captain I needed to go back on the oxygen. We both donned the masks again until descending through 6K' at which point the symptoms previously experienced had gone away. Captain was in communications with the cabin throughout the event and we both acknowledged and sent messages to the company via ACARS. Both the approach and landing on RWY 17L at ZZZ1 were uneventful and as briefed.,B737-800 First Officer reported a loss of pressurization at altitude and resulting emergency descent.

To get ahead; he conducted walk-around while passengers deplaned. All tires and other items appeared normal during exterior preflight. The aircraft mechanic later confirmed with me; during post flight; that he also checked the tires; with no issues noted. During preflight the F/O wrote down the hydraulic quantities of 92% A; and 87% B. We were near our max structural take-off weight. Load Planning confirmed with me that we could not take an off-line pilot jumpseater; and closely monitored the weight of the last bags; the jetway was even brought back to the aircraft to remove a standby passenger to lower our weight. We needed to burn (at least) 400 lbs of fuel to lower our weight during taxi. We began taxiing with 44.2k lbs; and requested a delay near the end of the runway to reach 43.8k lbs. Our weight at the beginning of the take-off roll was 174.1k lbs.During the take-off roll; Runway XR seemed rough to me; as if it needed repair; especially along the blackened center area during the first third of the runway. No asymmetry noted. I did note a very small; slightly abrupt jolt; upon lift-off. After lift-off we heard the next aircraft tell Tower that they were unable to take-off due to FOD (Foreign Object Damage) on 1R. We had noticed none. A couple minutes later; Departure told us that there were tire pieces on the runway; probably from us. They asked our intentions; whether we wanted to return to ZZZ. With autopilot on; I remained PF (Pilot Flying). The F/O and I discussed our lack of secondary indications; and the seemingly normal take-off. As we were overweight; I was not in a hurry to land unnecessarily. We had many landing options enroute ZZZ1; and could also ask ZZZ1 for assistance if needed; upon arrival. We told [Tracon] we would continue. Within a minute; the ENG1 LOW PRESSURE light; on the A side of the Hydraulic panel; illuminated. We assumed it was related to tire damage.The F/O ran the HYDRAULIC PUMP LOW PRESSURE QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) checklist; and we secured the ENG1 pump. Upon checking the hydraulic system; the copilot first saw 18%; and I saw 14% quantity. Pressure still indicated normal (2900+); but we doubted that would remain within limits for long. We told Approach we would be returning to ZZZ; and began reviewing Loss of Hydraulic System A QRH. A system pressure began dropping within a couple minutes. The F/O ran the LOSS OF SYSTEM A QRH. He also ensured an emergency was declared with ATC. I briefly notified the flight attendants; to not begin service; we would return to ZZZ within 30 minutes; we had a tire and hydraulic problem; and that I would most likely ask them to prep for Evac (Evacuation). Weather was perfect at ZZZ (VMC); winds 290/8; BKN70); and XR and XC were both 11;500 ft. We did not want XR; due to FOD; and planned/requested XC. F/O set up FMC (Flight Management Computer). F/O ensured that Approach knew we wanted emergency vehicles upon landing. I asked F/O to reiterate significant checklist items that would affect landing; and said we still needed approach brief; descent & approach checklists; and time for a PA announcement. He reminded me of the timing of the manual gear extension checklist as well. I also asked him to check FM (Flight Manual) for any guidance on overweight landings; and we found none. Instead; we calculated landing ground roll per emergency checklist (5-6;000ft); and discussed higher speeds (165kts for approach) in comparison to flap speeds. Dispatch additionally volunteered that XL landing would be 5000ft. I gave PA announcement to passengers; explaining problem briefly; plans to safely prep for all contingencies in back; and emphasized that they needed to listen to their very well trained flight attendants. F/O took control of plane while I briefed approach. We ran remaining checklists; reviewed evacuation checklist; and successfully extended gear manually.  F/O emphasized that gear would not retract during go-around. I discussed importance of F/O's 'remain seated' call during landing roll-out; as back of aircraft was thinking extensively about evacuation. We decided we would be spring-loaded to initially say this; and it could be changed later. I had F/O talk directly with F/A's to clarify how he would communicate with them (which he did exceptionally well.) Approach volunteered glideslope was out for XC ILS and offered visual. I requested LOC G/S out; to keep us matched more closely to planned approach. F/O also had box programmed for VNAV vertical guidance. Even though G/S indications were still received; and appeared correct; we referenced step-down altitudes on approach as well. About 3;000 feet; I disconnected autopilot and auto-throttle; and flew manually; to preclude excess automation programming on a VMC day; and focus upon approach speeds. PAPI 3-1 back-up; VNAV profile on FDI (flight Director Indicator); and step-down altitudes provided more than enough guidance. (Plus; we had emergency declared.) I touched down about 2;500-3;000 feet down runway. I sacrificed earlier touchdown; to prioritize rate of descent and a smooth touchdown; to minimize gear impact. Touchdown was very smooth; I used reverse during first 5;000 ft of roll-out; with no asymmetry noted; and brakes during last 3;000 of roll-out. As there was no asymmetry; minimal roughness; and aircraft did respond well to initial use of (alternate) nose-wheel steering; I elected to turn onto taxiway XX; and then stop immediately after hold-short. Approximately 5-10 emergency vehicles were waiting. I started APU immediately. F/O decided to leave flaps in down position. Fire Rescue gave us a contact frequency; and we spelled out we wanted tire inspection; check for smoke; excess heat; and leakage. They found significant tire damage; no smoke; temperatures of left and right brakes at 350F; and leakage. I had them clarify whether leakage was fuel or hydraulic; and it was hydraulic. They also found damage to underside of left wing; and we again asked for clarification on any fuel leakage from wing (there was none.)I was surprised that no tow vehicles were present. As we needed to stay on ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) and Ground frequencies; I ACARs'd Dispatch to request towing. It took 15 more minutes for tow tug to arrive. Beyond that; it took another 20 minutes; for ARFF to finish inspection; and clear out the 50+ people and 10+ vehicles. We made about 4 PA announcements; keeping passengers informed of fire inspection; request for tow equipment; arrival of tow equipment; and arrival gate. I additionally checked with F/A's (Flight Attendants) as to how they were doing; and how passengers were doing. They said all passengers were doing very well; which I believe is due to the excellent job our F/A's did; and the 20+ years experience they had. We were towed to gate X. The tow team requested that we initially request taxi. This led to confusion as to who was communication with Ground throughout the remainder of the towing operation; especially when we entered the ramp. It would be better to just have the tow operator communicate with Ground/Ramp; per their usual procedures; rather than add pilots into the mix. We can easily just monitor the same frequencies. Passengers deplaned uneventfully. Even though F/O did a phenomenal job with every step of this event; he and I decided that we did not want to fly any more until the following day. Chance of distraction was too great; and we needed a break.  I talked with Flight Manager and ALPA (Airline Pilots Association) Incident Hotline.,B737 Flight Crew encountered tire tread failure during takeoff.

Looked out the window to see the first stage fan windmilling and no signs of fire or other damage. Sat tight for a bit to allow everyone to stabilize and then shared our thoughts with the forward cabin crew but also stating that any final word would have to come from the flying Captain and suggesting they just wait for him to call them which he did in a normal timely fashion given the situation. After confirming things in the cockpit were as we expected; engine shut down; no fire; preparing for return; I went to the back galley to make sure the aft cabin crew was fully informed and could expect a normal landing with fire trucks to follow with no need to prepare the cabin further yet be ready for evacuation if signal is given. We proceeded to land normally and have the AFR (Airport Fire Rescue) crews surround the aircraft. After taking the brake temps the left one was found to be hot; around 800 degrees F due to no thrust reverse on that engine and the braking system regulating more pressure to that side. The right brake was normal temp or about 300 F. The guys put a brake fan on it to speed up cooling and we then taxied to the gate with them in tow for an uneventful conclusion. Great job to both the flight and cabin crew in handling a startling event calmly and methodically.,B737 First Officer engine failure in flight resulting in a divert and uneventful landing.

Passengers began to complain. First officer came out of flight deck to observe smell and he could smell the odor as well. FA- 1 came to observe the smell and her eyes started burning. Captain then advised we had to divert to ZZZ. Oxygen was administered to FA-2 because she was lightheaded with burning eyes and a headache.

The MCP panel [was] set correctly after we were on an approach segment. We started getting some wake turbulence from the aircraft ahead of us. First Officer disconnected autopilot to get out of the turbulence. [We were] then told to only descend to 4;000 feet and look for traffic at 2 o'clock. [We were] unable to see traffic and asked to slow due to wake turbulence. [We were] slowed to 180 knots leveled at 4; 000 feet which started to get up high on the glide slope. [We were] than given 3;400 feet; then 3;100 feet and slow down; report traffic in sight. We were high on the approach and unable to see the traffic; so I asked to get pulled off the approach or cleared for the approach. [We were] to turn to a 140 heading and climb to 4;000 feet. High work load as we tried to comply with instructions; fly the aircraft; and listen to ATC. Cleaned up aircraft turned and climbed but went to 4.400 feet as the new altitude was set in MCP panel and leveled off and descended to cleared altitude. Finished the go around procedure and sequenced for another approach. Was told they needed to get the other aircraft ahead of us due to a medical emergency. High work load on the go-around with just a small altitude change.,B737NG Captain reported an altitude overshoot during a go-around at LAX.

The flight was in normal cruise flight at 36;000 feet; approximately .81 Mach approaching the ZZZZZ waypoint; shortly after traveling north. During a scan of the engine instruments; I noticed that the right engine EPR (Engine Pressure Ratio) was reading 1.03 with a reduced fuel flow of about 3.0. The left engine EPR was much higher and the fuel flow was greater than 7.0. I pointed out the discrepancy to the Captain. We began to troubleshoot the problem and determined it was not an indication error. Movement of the right throttle caused no response in the right engine instrumentation nor was [an] engine response was felt or heard. The aircraft was maintaining 36;000 feet but had slowed down to approximately .78 mach. It appeared as if the right engine was stuck in idle. The right igniters were placed in the 'Flight' position; no positive response was indicated by this action. A fuel imbalance was noted so we began to balance the fuel. After a short discussion of available diverts; ZZZ was decided upon if required. Upon reaching waypoint ZZZZZ we checked in with ZZZ Control and informed them of the possible need to divert to ZZZ. I believe it was about 250 miles away at the time. Captain informed the cabin crew and summoned the First Officer that was on break. The Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via SATCOM. I concentrated on flying the aircraft and making radio calls. When the FO returned to the flight deck the Captain briefed her on the divert and the engine status and pulled out the QRH in case the status deteriorated. He also briefed the Purser; who also had to be gotten from break; with the TEST items and that we had 30 minutes until landing. Dispatch sent landing data and weather. The right engine continued to only produce an EPR of approximately 1.03. We informed ZZZ Control of our need to divert because of an engine issue and [requested priority handling]. We were given a vector and descent to 11;000 feet. During our descent to 11;000 feet; passing through 25-30;000 feet; the right engine failed which was indicated by oil pressure in the red. The Captain executed and FO read the beginning of the engine failure QRH. It was determined by an indication on N1 and N2 that the engine re-lite checklist would be accomplished. The EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) showed the relight altitudes and airspeeds and we were within those parameters. The QRH procedure was followed but the engine did not relight. The Captain informed ZZZ Approach that our engine loss of power was now an engine failure and that we were single engine. He also informed dispatch of the change in status and [Maintenance Control] and the Purser. ZZZ controllers gave us vectors to the ILS Runway X at ZZZ. We reviewed the emergency procedures to ensure we didn't miss anything. I briefed the approach IAW SOP. On localizer interception; the aircraft was high and fast so I disconnected the autopilot and hand flew the now visual approach. The approach to land was high all the way until approximately 300 feet. (My 500 foot callout was non-standard: I called out 'Correcting' the high flight path). At about 40 feet the Captain stated 'Flare'; and I did so: I landed the aircraft (normal touchdown and within the landing zone) and came to a complete stop on the runway centerline. The 4 right brakes showed signs of overheating (EICAS display of up to 9) so we exited the runway and executed the QRH Hot Brake procedures. While waiting for the brakes to cool; the emergency ground crew noticed fuel leaking from the right engine. We noticed the right Fuel Control switch was on with one of the lights above it illuminated; we placed it in Cutoff. The fuel leak continued so we pulled the right engine fire handle (but did not fire the bottle) and the fuel leak stopped. Additionally; the two; right; inboard tires deflated as their fuse plugs blew. After waiting the required brake cooling time; the aircraft was towed to the gate in ZZZ. A walk around inspection revealed the two deflated tires but no visible damage to the right engine. Earlier in the flight we did I receive two engine related status messages; one was the R ENG EEC (Electronic Engine Control) C1 and I don't recall the other. During the flight I looked it up in the MEL and it reads 'NOTE: C1 FAULTS ARE ANNUNCIATED FOR MAINTENANCE PURPOSES ONLY' so I disregarded it. I have no idea if this caused the engine malfunction or not.,B767 flight crew reported an engine failure; resulting in a diversion.

My First Officer needed to use the rest room. He called the crew and within minutes; the Flight Attendant entered the cockpit and the First Officer stepped out.I was placing my mask on when I realized that something just didn't sound right. Specifically; when I first pulled the mask out of the stored position. There was no hissing sound or any flow of oxygen. I pulled up the oxygen page and realized that all cockpit crew oxygen was completely depleted. At that point; I did not want to alarm or panic the Flight Attendant that was currently in the cockpit.I waited for my First Officer to return and requested from ZZZZ Control to descend to FL250. I also requested that the Relief Pilot return to the flight deck. I got a hold of Dispatch to inform them of our situations and diversion options. At this point; I had already informed ZZZZ Control Sector that we were working on an issue with the aircraft. I told Dispatch that due to our current aircraft status; we couldn't continue and needed to divert. I mentioned I was looking at ZZZZ1 and ZZZZ2. The Dispatcher informed me that those two airports could only be used for emergency purposes only. I confirmed with dispatch that I would [be advising ATC]; at that point; we both agreed on ZZZZ1.I was very comfortable with ZZZZ1 because both myself and the First Officer had been there in the past and runways and facilities were adequate for our aircraft and passengers. Shortly after [advising ATC] we were asked to squawk 7700 by air traffic control. We were vector to a 15 to 20 mile final for Runway XXC. We relayed to ATC the souls on board of 248 and a total fuel on board of approximately 110;000 [pounds] of fuel. The landing waiting at touchdown was 397;000 pounds. The landing was were smooth and rollout was uneventful. Emergency personnel followed the aircraft to the remote stand. The emergency personnel inspected the landing gear we were given the all clear. I believe that from a CRM prospective; we all (flight crew; Dispatch; Maintenance; ATC; and emergency personnel) worked well together inside and outside the cockpit to get the aircraft safely on the ground.,B767 pilot crew reported at cruise they discovered the crew oxygen system was empty.

ATC instructed us to descend to 4;000 [feet]. I started a V/S descent; at about 4;600 feet; ATC advised 'Stop descent; traffic alert 11 o'clock; 1 mile altitude indicates 3;700 [feet]' I clicked off the autopilot and leveled off at 4;500 feet. About the same time; TCAS issued a 'traffic traffic' call. We sighted the VFR aircraft; which appeared to be close off our left; and maintained visual separation as instructed by ATC.  Our recommended procedure of selecting TA on simultaneous parallel approaches (ZZZ 10-7) sets us up for not having TCAS RAs available following a go-around. We aren't trained; nor did I ever think about; going back to TA/RA after our Tower instructed go-around. It wasn't until we heard 'traffic traffic' that I remembered we were still in TA.  This incident followed a go-around; and we were extremely busy setting up for a new approach to a different runway.  We were never closer than 500 feet from the VFR aircraft to the best of my recollection but was still surprised by the proximity of the VFR aircraft.  Shortly after ATC advised us to descend to 4;000 feet. then cleared us for the visual approach [Runway] XXL.  I contacted the [Chief Pilot] to report the incident shortly after we landed.,A320 Captain reported after an ATC requested go-around; they encountered TA while on the return visual approach.

I was pilot flying; climbing through FL280 on our way to FL350 on the ZZZZZ 2; a loud audible bang occurred; simultaneously the aircraft shook and Engine Number 1 seized. Captain and myself immediately smelled fumes I would describe as acrid. We immediately performed memory items and Captain pulled out QRC (Quick Reference Checklist). There were very strong aircraft vibrations. We decided to run severe damage procedure because of the combination of vibration and fumes. We [requested priority handling] and decided to return to ZZZ. I turned the aircraft around and Captain talked to FA (Flight Attendant)'s and made a PA. On descent back into ZZZ; we transferred control and Captain flew while I coordinated with ATC; Dispatch; FAs and informed passengers. Captain flew an uneventful single engine visual to XXR. We stopped in between the 2 runways and had fire trucks look over the aircraft and brakes; after which they told us they didn't see anything. We coordinated with Ground and returned to our original gate. I entered an ELB (Electronic Logbook) entry at the gate and we verbally debriefed Maintenance. We informed [Chief Pilot] we would not fly another leg this day.,B737 flight crew reported number one engine failure; odor and vibrations; which led to a return to the departure airport.

Shortly thereafter; we experienced multiple system failures and ECAM warning messages. One of which was to land ASAP. The First Officer and I donned O2 masks and started emergency procedures. I [notified] ATC and requested to divert to the nearest suitable airport. After following checklist guidance; ECAM procedures and applying some systems knowledge; the smoke subsided; but the odor remained.Communication with the flight attendants was established and the plan to divert was communicated to the flight attendants. I asked them to prepare the cabin for an immediate landing; which they did. A diversion message was sent to Dispatch advising them of our situation and landing plans. I asked them to advise ZZZ operations of our impending arrival; which they did. A normal landing at ZZZ was made; and after communicating with the fire department; we deplaned. We asked that the passengers deplane; but leave their baggage in the overhead bins; which was later retrieved for them. No injuries were reported; the First Officer and I were quick to don our O2 masks; and neither of us felt any ill effects from the smoke. Contract Maintenance quickly arrived at the airplane and found that the number 1 battery had overheated and was likely the reason we had smoke in the cockpit. One of the ECAM actions had me turning off the number 1 battery; and in hindsight; this action probably contributed to our success more than anything else. Suggestion: Replace NiCad batteries with Lead Acid batteries.,A321 Captain reported diverting due to smoke in cockpit and uneventful landing.

I said that I did. Although it wasn't real strong at first. Captain called the FAs to ask them if they smelled anything. I was on ATC; so I didn't hear conversation with FAs. Things were starting to get busy as we were on the arrival. We donned our Oxygen masks when we thought that the odor had become more noticeable. Captain was running QRH and sending ACARS messages to Company Maintenance and Dispatch Dispatcher. [Notified ATC]. We made a normal approach and landed; taxied up but short of our gate. Then finally we were marshaled into the gate after a long wait. With the information the Dispatcher had (fumes dirty socks smell) we should have been allowed to proceed straight to the gate. The Captain and I both opened our windows in the rain to get fresh air into the aircraft as the smell was very strong by this point.Cause: I believe it was oil aerosol from the engine into the packs.,A319 First Officer reported a 'dirty socks' smell in cockpit which steadily intensified and resulting into an uneventful landing.

We reviewed the N1/N2 vibration indicators and they were well within the normal range. I suggested to the Captain that the vibration may be happening from something other than the engines. The Captain suggested that we review the vibration advisory in the QRH. We reviewed the QRH regarding engine vibration and noted what to do; in the event we had excessive engine vibration. The procedure was not needed under these specific conditions.The vibration was intermittent and hard to concretely sense it was really any concern. However; we did; for our own interest; review nearest airport options in case the vibration became significant.The vibration ended; and we didn't discuss more about it. Then about 10-15 minutes later; I smelled a burning smell towards the rudder pedals. It had the smell of something similar to when you light a match. I also felt some heat from the fumes. I advised the Captain that I believed we had smoke in the flight deck and we immediately donned our air masks. We then called the FAs (Flight Attendants); and they reported that they did not smell any smoke. We advised the FAs that we were keeping our masks on for now because we smelled smoke.  The Captain and I were slightly surprised that the FAs did not smell anything; because we were still smelling smoke. So to troubleshoot; we decided to look at all of our PEDs (personal devices) to see if anything was burning. PEDs were fine. While keeping the masks on; we did each take them off briefly to confirm we still had a burning smell; which we did.There were no indications from any of our instrumentation and advisory system screens that anything out of the ordinary was going on. But; I had no confidence that the burning smell was going to end. Rather; I was concerned that that situation was going to escalate from a burning smell to a fire. I shared my concerns with the Captain and that I felt we needed to divert to ZZZ (we were about 10-15 minutes from Top of Descent to [original destination]) if the smell persisted for 2 more minutes; and he agreed. The smell persisted; we advised Center that we needed to divert to ZZZ. They gave us vectors direct and to descend to 16;000 ft. We then advised the flight attendants we were diverting to ZZZ because we kept smelling a burning smell in the flight deck.Shortly after we started our descent; the FA's advised us that they also had a noticeable burning smell from the Exit Row up to the Flight Deck. Upon receiving this information; the Captain and I concurred that we should [advise ATC]; for priority into ZZZ and to have Fire/Rescue at the field. (Later we would also learn that there was a First Officer in Row 17; who also noticed a burning smell while were descending and asked the Flight Attendants if we were descending because of the burning smell.) I advised the FAs to grab their [emergency gear] at the ready; in case the situation got worse.We [advised ATC of the situation]; which triggered a plethora of ATC scripted questions to us; which workload permitting I answered. (e.g. the nature of the smoke?; where the smoke was?; were we wearing our oxygen masks?; souls on board?; fuel remaining?). Our priority at this point was to get the aircraft on the ground safely; but as quickly as possible. On the descent; I was very busy as Pilot Monitoring. First; we had our air masks on the whole time; which was cumbersome. Second; handling numerous comms with ATC; talking to the FAs; discussing the divert with the Captain; and loading a divert into the FMS for ZZZ. The Captain was handling the emergency descent; which took most of his attention. Center offered us any runway at ZZZ; I asked which way they were landing; they said west; so I requested XXL. The Captain was so busy with the descent that he did not change his instrument approach plates from [theoriginal destination] to ZZZ; nor did he have time to; so I asked for him to hand me his iPad and I loaded the appropriate plates for the divert to ZZZ.Approach checklist was handled through 18;000 feet; as is standard. Flight Attendants advised they were doing okay in the cabin. We discussed how to brief the passengers; FAs asked if we were going to say something to the passengers. But; because we were wearing our air masks; I asked the FAs to give the briefing; as I did not want to raise more panic by them hearing me sound like Darth Vader on the overhead speaker with my air mask on. The Captain advised them to say we were going to ZZZ out of a safety precaution. While getting ready for landing; I did not have time to get ATIS; were too busy; so I asked ATC for the weather; to enter into the FMS for performance. The weather was good; it would be a night visual. We did not have time to ACARS dispatch of the divert; that would have been too much of a time sink and a distraction. I thought about it; but did not see having any time to do it; nor did I think about asking ATC to contact company; was just too busy.When we got lined up for a long final approach; we were still too high; so ATC vectored us out towards the East. They asked me when we wanted to turn back to the field. I advised them that it was too dark in the direction we were flying; that we could not see the airport; we were descending at 3;000 fpm; and if they would help us by calling our turn back to the final approach course. I was also getting task saturated.ATC turned us a couple more times; then switched us to Approach Control. At this point they advised us that Rwy XXL was closed (I wish Center would have told us; since we requested XXL with them; that would have saved me time close in to the field). So; I was busy again loading the FMS for XXR. When handed off to tower; we advised that we anticipated a normal landing; and that we planned to taxi off the runway. Landing Checklist was completed. Fire and Rescue was all lined up; adjacent to the field. Landing was uneventful.Upon landing; we taxied off. At this point there began to be confusion. First; we called Ops and they said they didn't have a gate for us; Second; Ground Control advised that the Fire Department was on a different frequency and wanted to talk about how to scan the plane for hot spots; third; we had a bunch of caution/fault lights just come on after we taxied off the runway regarding Faults with the Avionics Blower and Extract Fan; requiring an ECAM procedure to override; and then the Fault warnings repeated even after we pressed the overrides. While talking with the Fire Department; they advised we needed to pull to a gate to scan the plane. At that moment; the FA's in the back called us and advised that they now; for the first time; were smelling smoke. We told them to update us if it got worse and that we were sorting out getting a gate.We quickly advised Ops that we needed a gate immediately; or we were going to request any gate at the airport. And if we didn't get any gate and if the smoke smell escalated; then the next consideration was to potentially have the air slides deploy to get the passengers off the plane. Ops responded to go to Gate Z. Upon getting to the gate; the ground crew scrambled to get us in; after parking we opened up our emergency windows in the flight deck; to get fresh air in the plane.Fire Department came on the plane first in full gear (while the passengers remained seated); followed by Maintenance in the flight deck where they reviewed the fault lights we had for the avionics. The Captain got real busy with Dispatch; maintenance; and observing the deplaning process.While we were super busy in the flight deck; a [company] Gate Lead popped in and interrupted us in front of maintenance to tell us that Crew Scheduling had us taking another Airbus; that was a RON (Routine Overnight); to take the passengers on to [the original destination]. The Captain politely told the Gate Lead that we did not know that and we weren't sure we were going to do that; and that we had to talk to several people before we consider that.The Captain called the [Chief Pilot]; and apparently the [Chief Pilot] said that we could take the passengers on to [the original destination]; but he had our back either way if we decided not to. At this point; that would have been an FDP (Flight Duty Period) extension. I told the Captain that I was shocked that the [Chief Pilot] would even suggest such a thing; us flying another leg and take an extension; after we had just had an emergency; performed an emergency descent; a divert to ZZZ; and had our air masks on for over 30 minutes. I found it to be incredibly insensitive; and inappropriate. The inconvenience to the passengers should be handled by another flight crew; it appeared to me that Management's view of Safety was getting blurred with operational needs to accommodate the stranded passengers.After the flight had deplaned the Captain; walked up the jetway to greet passengers to see if everyone was okay. There were no health problems. Meanwhile; the flight attendants and I discussed that we did not want to do another leg. One flight attendant in particular had already told the Gate Lead that he did not want to work another leg.While in the jetway; discussing the situation with the flight crew; the Gate Lead came down to talk to us; but she was still on the phone; talking to someone in Dispatch/Ops and telling them that she wasn't sure if the crew was going to continue to [the original destination]; because one of the flight attendants was having issues. The flight attendant told the Gate Lead that it was very insensitive of her to be calling him out in front of everybody as the problem for not continuing the flight to [the original destination]. The Gate Lead did not get what the FA was saying; rather she started to bark at all of us; that all her Managers had gone for the day; they had no real help from the company to accommodate the stranded passengers and that it was going to be a real inconvenience for them; if we didn't continue on with another flight.The Gate Lead left for a moment; and the crew discussed how we felt about flying another leg. All three FA's said they were tired and could do the flight; only because it was short. The Captain said he was fine to continue to [the original destination]; but if other's didn't want to go; he would support that decision. One Flight Attendant said because it was a short flight he could do it; but really didn't want to because earlier this year he had a fume event and got sick from it; and had to get medical attention. The Captain said; whatever you guys want to do; I'll support your decision. The Gate Lead came back again; she looked stressed and then got really pushy and was saying 'I don't know what's the hold-up; are you going to do the flight?' At this point I said that the Gate Lead was too overbearing; that she was smothering us and becoming the problem; pushing us after we had just handled an emergency; and we still needed time to decompress. The Gate Lead would not leave; and I told her that we were not going to make a decision until she gave us some space.After the Gate Lead left; I reflected on the day (three legs; and not wanting to do an FDP extension for a 4th leg; after an emergency). While I knew I could go to [the original destination]; I was now irritated by the Gate Lead singling out the FA that didn't want to go; and then being way too pushy to us to work the next flight. So; I told the Captain; there's no way I'm doing another leg; and we need hotel rooms in ZZZ. The Captain told the Gate Lead.While waiting for Crew Scheduling to figure out hotels; the Gate Lead approached me and said she was sorry; that she realized we have a very busy night; and she was wrong to push us.[Company] pushes crews after an emergency to work extra flight.,A320 First Officer reported mild airframe vibrations followed by a burning odor and fumes; which resulted in a diversion.

Departing from gate.  This was my fifth right seat leg in the LCA training. My first leg out of ZZZ and on this ID. All preparations flows and checklists went well and the performance data was loaded for a reduced takeoff from XYR at [taxiway]. The final WT manifest showed:TOG: 159234TOW CHG: -615 ZFW: 130634 CG: 23.6 TAKEOFF DATA MSG SHOWED: 3KT HEADWIND 8KT CROSSWIND TOCG/TRIM 23.6 REDUCED NUMBERS WERE V1 147 VR 149 V2 153 On taxiout we were given taxi instructions for a XXL Departure. RWY XXL via [taxi route]. [En route during taxi] I reported going heads down to load the new runway and get new performance numbers. Ground traffic was light with minimal delays and minor ATC distractions encountered except for slowing to wait for a maintenance truck to move off and clear to the right as we turned onto Victor taxiway. The new runway was loaded; Performance requested and loaded; checklists completed; lineup and wait and takeoff clearance given. Takeoff roll and call outs were normal. As I recall; after the rotate call; the rotation felt normal. With the wheels still on the runway; and as rotation continued I felt an abnormal thump. We became airborne; began to climb and raised the gear. Initially; the Captain thought we must have blown a tire on the right side and reported that possibility to the tower. We noted that the gear came up normally and that all the gear lights were out (normal indications). Tower informed us they would inspect the runway and report the results through ATC.I thought initially that it might be due to dissipating wingtip vortices from a B777 that had landed recently on XYC [intersecting runway]. While waiting for a response from ATC the Captain called the flight attendants and ask if they felt the same anomaly. They confirmed that they felt the thump. We both suspected that ATC would confirm a tire failure. Somewhere close to the top of climb (FL340) ATC passed the word that ZZZ had completed a runway sweep and that no tire debris was located. We began to troubleshoot other options. Bird strike and cargo shift were briefly discussed and dismissed. I briefly considered tail strike but since my tendency is to rotate between 2-2.5 degrees per second; and my departure pitch is normally between 5-5.9 degrees (I can never recall more than 6.3 degrees); I thought it unlikely. However; since we were still stymied by the lack of tire failure confirmation I checked the [Flight Data Unit]. To my surprise Departure pitch was 11.2 degrees. On a B737-800 tail strike can occur at 11 degrees. I reported the discovery to the Captain and he immediately informed Dispatch as I pulled out the QRH. The Captain suggested a return to ZZZ (nearest suitable). Dispatch wanted a Conference Call with [Maintenance Control] and the [Chief Pilot]. Ultimately the decision was made to divert to ZZZ1 (nearest suitable after the conference call).The landing in ZZZ1 was uneventful and upon gate arrival maintenance confirmed a tail strike with the tail shoe scraped. Red and green lines remained visible on the cartridge. While airborne and after we determined that a tail strike was the suspected event I retrieved all of the departure paperwork and reviewed it for errors or anomalies. What I found was: TAKEOFF DATA FOR RWY XXL that was loaded AND EXECUTED was: 8KT HW 3KT XW CG 23.6 FLAPS 5 BLEEDS ON ASSUMED WT 130.8ASSUMED TEMP 65CREDUCED EPR 89.8V1 127 VR 133 V2 138I had loaded and requested ZFW as my TOG wt. What's worse is that after executing those TO speeds we received an ACARS msg that said: ************WARNING'************ REQUESTED TAKEOFF DATA MESSAGE ASSUMED WT 130.8 LESS THAN FINAL WEIGHT MANIFEST TOG 159.3 I recall getting that message about the time the maintenance truck was becoming an issue. WhenI returned to look at the message my eyes went straight to 130.8 and I failed to read the entire message. I confirmed 130.8 on the TOW page and accepted and executed the speeds for takeoff.This was clearly a costly error on my part and I make no excuses for my lack of attention to detail in this matter. Lack of experience in the right seat and ACARS performance work is no excuse. I also should have shown the Captain the message which would have slowed me down and; I am confident; would have prevented the tail strike.,B737 flight crew reported tailstrike after having loaded incorrect takeoff data that went undiscovered.

Fairly heavy B737NG at 174;000 lbs; 35;000 lbs of fuel bound for ZZZ1. At approximately 2;000 MSL I began to detect a burning or melting plastic odor; smelling identical to what a piece of Tupperware that had fallen onto the heating element in a dishwasher and melted would smell like. I asked the First Officer if he smelled it and he replied 'YES'. We were still sterile cockpit; but the flight attendants called from the back and were very concerned with the same odor that was 'filling the cabin.' I told them to search the cabin to see if the source of the odor could be isolated; lavatories; ovens; coffee maker etc.; and call back. We had leveled at 5;000 feet and when ZZZ Departure issued us another climb; I declined the climb and told ATC we had an issue and would get back with them. At this point the First Officer's audio control panel went haywire with extremely loud static being broadcast into his headset and speaker; regardless of what radio was selected and he was unable to transmit. The Purser called back and said that the source of the odor could not be determined but it was strong; and she now smelled what she described as 'burning paper.' This aircraft had just returned to service after a change of the #2 engine and this was the first flight after the change. The engine in terms of performance was operating normally but the possibility of it being involved in creating this situation did give me further concern. With the combination of the unidentifiable odor and failure of communication equipment; I made the decision to [advise ATC] and return back to ZZZ.Once [advised]; ATC was very efficient in getting us back around for a landing on one of the long western facing runways and things happened rapidly. We were landing overweight and I wanted a long runway for braking and winds which were quite gusty with a crosswind component. The First Officer remained as the Flying Pilot and executed a normal approach and landing to Runway XXR. Upon exiting the runway; we had fire and emergency personnel inspect the aircraft for a potential fire source. No abnormal heat source could be detected; and we returned to [the] gate without further incident.,B737NG flight crew reported a return to departure airport due to smelling a 'burning plastic' odor throughout the aircraft during initial climb.

After lengthy delay for weather and ramp closure; taxi to and departed RWY XXR ZZZ on ZZZZZ2 RNAV SID. After hearing windshear alerts/warnings being issued by ATC; we pulled out of line to check performance numbers and decided to use improved performance with TOGA and APU on for an abundance of caution given the weather and takeoff weight of the aircraft. Departed XXR without incident on heading 340 for weather avoidance with subsequent radar vectors to rejoin the departure. APU was shut down normally as part of after takeoff flow. Approx. climbing through FL210 to FL300; two ECAM caution messages illuminated (AIR ENG1 BLD ABNORM PR and AIR ENG2 BLD ABNORML PR). FO retained control of the aircraft and assumed radio communications; I (CA) began completing the ECAM action items; which did not correct the malfunction. The QRH was referenced for follow up action which allowed for two reset attempts since the takeoff was completed APU on. However; the QRH was not clear in the event of both EBV failing. We attempted the EBV resets with no resolution of the malfunction. Noting that there was no air being directed to the packs; the cabin altitude was beginning to rise; and started the APU to mitigate the pressurization issue as an added barrier for safety. The cabin altitude then stabilized normally. I (CA) then contacted IOC via the sat phone app for other maintenance guidance and discussing a likely return to ZZZ. During that call an additional ECAM caution message air APU bleed fault and noted then APU bleed valve also closed to the packs and cabin altitude began to rise rapidly. At that point; a request was made with ATC to return to ZZZ along with an immediate descent with a pressurization issue. We began a left turn to heading 180 and began emergency descent to FL100 while monitoring cabin altitude which peaked at 8;900 feet. I briefed cabin crew; passengers and dispatch with emergency and plan return to ZZZ. The flight crew discussed and determined an immediate overweight landing was the safest course of action given the multi-system failures; current aircraft weight of approximately 175;000 lbs; and unstable weather in the area. Completed QRH overweight landing procedures and reviewed landing performance data for ZZZ RWY XYR. A request was made for ARFF [airport rescue firefighting] to be available during landing and taxi in the event of a hot brake complication. Normal flaps full; low auto brakes landing was made with vertical descent rate of less than 100 FPM. Full reverse immediately applied at touchdown and auto brakes off about halfway down the RWY with stopping distance assured. ARFF reported nothing abnormal with gear and followed aircraft to gate. With brake fans on; single-engine taxi procedures used to reduce further brake load. Peak brake temp of 290 c. Flight parked at gate without further incident; appropriate maintenance write-ups entered in AML and Maintenance Techs present to meet aircraft were briefed. No injuries or reports of passenger discomfort with the changing cabin altitude.,A321 Captain reported a pressurization failure during climb.

The [Relief Pilot] who was then on his break and readily available; proceeded to pull the CBs (Circuit Breaker) associated to the mid galley section. Within a period of time the fire receded. Considering the gravity of the situation; and the potential for the fire to restart; we elected to return to ZZZZ. We contacted ATC with the 'pan; pan; pan' radio call and requested radar vectors to ZZZZ. Upon arrival in ZZZZ; in order to get on the ground ASAP; as a crew; we decided to land the aircraft overweight as per QRH.,A330 First Officer and Flight Attendant reported a galley electrical fire associated with a faulty coffee maker; which resulted in an air return to the departure airport.

We departed Runway XX at ZZZ. After rotation Captain called 'Positive rate; gear up'. About the same time the Tower called and handed us off to Departure frequency. We checked in with Departure and he gave us a climb to 6000 feet and at about the same time we got an ECAM. The ECAM was for gear not up locked. While we were following the ECAM for the gear not up locked; Captain called for Flaps 1 and we got another ECAM for flaps locked and continued following the ECAM. While dealing with both of these ECAM messages we [advised ATC] as we realized we had multiple hydraulic issues as more ECAM messages popped in. The first was the green hydraulic system overheat. While addressing that we got the yellow system overheat and began to realize we had a serious hydraulic issue. We followed ECAM protocol and had a red 'Land ASAP' message along with several others. As we received vectors for ZZZ1 which was our request for our [situation]; we quickly assessed that we could have full flight control failure and asked to turn to Runway XXL immediately to land as quickly as safely possible. We had to gravity drop the gear; we had flaps jammed at Position 1 and we finished all ECAMs. ECAMs complete; screens normal. Ran landing checklist; let cabin attendants know we were diverting to Newark and to remain seated with seat belts fastened.The landing was normal and smooth. As the plane touched down I noticed the left side was a little lower than the right but the Captain was able to keep it on the centerline as he decelerated. Braking felt normal. As it slowed down we began to drift to the right and the Captain was able to keep it mostly on the high speed taxiway with just a small portion of the aircraft off the side. We completed the evacuation checklist per SOP and evacuated the aircraft. Both Captain and I followed checklist and SOP for verifying the aircraft was clear; and evacuated ourselves.,A319 flight crew reported multiple hydraulic failures shortly after departure resulting in an uneventful immediate diversion.

We were in ZZZ on an originator. Runway XXR was the active runway.  During takeoff at approximately 90 knots the First Officer and I both started to smell a faint odor in the cockpit.  We briefly discussed it as it continued to intensify and I made the decision to continue takeoff.  As we passed through 500 feet AGL; the odor turned into heavy burning oil-like fumes.  I could noticeably feel tingling in my fingers and a slight light-headedness.  We both went on oxygen.  At approximately 800 feet AGL; the flight attendants called and reported significant fumes throughout the cabin.  I notified ATC; [advised]; and requested vectors for a return to Runway XX. We stopped the climb and while the First Officer flew the aircraft; I ran the Smoke; Fire; or Fumes Checklist using the QRC.  After completing that; the QRC directed us to the QRH; Smoke; Fire or Fumes Checklist.  The QRH checklist seemed designed for electrical fire/fumes; as it called for shutting down multiple electrical components. The First Officer and I agreed that what we currently had was not an electrical problem and decided to stop that checklist and prepare for the return.  We gathered landing data via [weight and balance system] and completed the Descent and Approach Checklists as well as quickly referencing the Diversion Checklist.  The First Officer flew the aircraft and prepared the FMC and cockpit for a landing on Runway XX at ZZZ. When I talked to the flight attendants a second time they reported the fumes were still very strong and I could hear them coughing while trying to talk.  We focused on getting the aircraft on the ground as quickly and as safely as possible.  I briefed the passengers on the PA and told them we would be returning to ZZZ.  When we were established on final approach; I took the aircraft from the First Officer and we made a normal landing (we were under max gross weight for landing).  We stopped on the runway to allow the Fire/Crash Crews to inspect the exterior of the aircraft.  They did not see anything out of the ordinary and we asked them to follow us to the gate.We pulled into the gate and had the passengers exit normally using the jet bridge.  The First Officer and I were on oxygen from 500 feet AGL after takeoff until engine shutdown at the gate.  After all passengers had deplaned; I debriefed with the crew.  All five of us reported symptoms that included headaches; numbness in fingers; soreness in throat/chest; shortness of breath; dry cough and light-headedness.  We went to a local emergency room and were released five hours later after continuous oxygen treatment and carbon monoxide blood tests.After the flight; Maintenance told us they had performed an engine wash the night before the incident and that it is possible that it had something to do with the fumes.  If that is the case; then perhaps the engine wash and subsequent engine run procedures need to be reviewed in an effort to prevent this type of event from happening again.,Flight crew flying 737-700 encountered fumes in the cockpit after takeoff.

Capt (PF) (Pilot Flying) gave me (PM) (Pilot Monitoring) the controls and said he would take the radios and I would fly the a/c (Aircraft). We sent MRM (Maintenance Reporting Manual). Right after that; we got an ELAC (Elevator Aileron Computer) # 2 fault. We followed the procedures in QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). After the process of QRH steps; we got a Left ELEV fault. We followed the steps in the QRH for that. At the same time ATC (Air Traffic Control) cleared us to descend via the ZZZZZ-3. With possible flight control issues; we agreed we should declare an emergency with ATC. The QRH referenced do not use Speed Brakes and possible Direct Law at gear down. So ATC cleared us straight to ZZZ for the RWY X ILS (instrument Landing System). The Capt took back the controls and I assumed the PM duties. We landed safely at ZZZ the and taxied to the gate.,Flight Crew flying A320 encountered multiple system failures prior to landing.

I was the Pilot Flying. Flight was routine until we were about 170 miles out of ZZZ1. My First Officer was having problems with his radios when answering. We finally figured out that the problem was his ACP (Audio Control Panel) panel. It was causing problems with his speaker and Mic. He could only hear out of my side. I told him to make the landing and I will do the radios. It was just after that time we got a F/CTL ELAC 2 PITCH FAULT ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). We got the book out and went through the reset procedure. When we reset the ELAC (Elevator Aileron Control) we received a FLT CONTROL ELAC 2 FAULT and F/ CTL L ELEV FAULT. I should also mention that on takeoff on [Runway] 28L in ZZZ when I rotated the aircraft it felt unresponsive with pitch initially. I even mentioned to [First Officer] that the CG must have been wrong; so this now got my attention. Descent was now upon us and we started down. When reading the notes in the book about no use of the speed brakes and Flaps 3 landing with a note that said we would lose normal law and revert to direct law when we dropped the gear. I decided to try to communicate with Dispatch and Maintenance. I had them call me and with the radio issues and was able to confirm what we had read in the handbook. The work load was really starting to increase at this point. I told [First Officer] I would take control of the aircraft. With the degradation of the elevator system along with being unable to use the speed brakes to meet ATC constraints on the STAR; I decided to [advise ATC]. I briefed our Purser about the situation but did not prep the cabin. ATC got us right in and we landed on Runway 9 with no issues. It should be noted that when we dropped the gear we never did go to direct law. We did have elevator flutter on the descent however.,Flight crew flying A320 encountered multiple system failures in flight.

Dispatch was notified of intent to declare an emergency; flight attendants were briefed and brief description of situation provided to the passengers. [Advised] with ATC and coordinated with dispatch for emergency equipment to be available upon arrival at ZZZ1. Requested relief from ATC from the ZZZZZ1 STAR and requested an ILS to Runway XXR. Landed without incident and cleared Runway XXR at Intersection Q. Stopped between runways XXL and XXR and waited for tow to gate.

No warnings or instrument indications of anything wrong were ever presented from the aircraft. As speed increased and we cleaned up and accelerated on an NADP1 schedule; vibrations became greater and wind noise very loud.  We got as fast as 240 knots indicated. I directed the First Officer (Pilot Flying) not to accelerate any more. At FL150; we leveled off and I directed the First Officer to slow the aircraft. I worked with ATC to allow us time to investigate. Engines; doors; windows; packs and pressurization were all normal. Discussed with the First Officer; and decided to return to ZZZZ and check the aircraft on the ground. No fuel dump required; no emergency was declared. We put the gear down at 25 miles to touchdown; and the noise and vibration reduced significantly. All gear indications were in the green. Landing by First Officer was uneventful.  The brace from the nose gear to the left nose gear door had broken; and the door was swinging freely on its two hinges. The gear door had a crack in it near the rear hinge.,B777 Captain reported after gear retract; noise and vibration were heard/felt; resulting in a return to airport.

I asked fight attendants to look at Number 1 engine for indications of streaming fluid. First Officer with concurrence pulled back Number 1 engine to idle. Oil pressure started to fall and was soon highlighted. Oil temperature on Number 1 was slowly rising to match Number 2 which had a much higher power setting. QRH consulted for engine low oil pressure; recommending engine shutdown. Flight attendants reported no visual streaming. I assumed Pilot Flying duties and engine was shut down in accordance with QRH procedures directed by First Officer. First Officer sent message to Dispatch informing of situation and declared an emergency with ATC (TRACON).I informed flight attendants of engine shutdown and expectations of normal landing; rollout; inspection by ZZZ Fire Department; and then taxi to gate. I made similar PA to Passengers. The flight attendants calmly secured the cabin for arrival. First Officer got 15 flap numbers from [weight and balance system] and directed the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist in the QRH covering all contingencies. Flight touched down uneventfully on Runway 30 in ZZZ. I intentionally rolled past [first taxiway] high speed to [second taxiway] to meet awaiting fire truck and not shut down arrivals into ZZZ. First Officer retrieved the brake cooling requirements and determined the Safety of inspection by ZZZ Fire and ability to taxi to gate. Fire inspection observed small amount of oil smoke from oil in the aft engine area and recommended they follow us to gate which they did.,B737 flight crew reported the loss of the Number 1 engine oil pressure during descent; which resulted in a an inflight engine shutdown.

We both selected the Localizer in our active NAV radios. I don't know when he switched his frequency to the VOR after his brief. I verified I was 'tuned and identified.' Approach gave us the final turn to intercept the localizer and cleared us for the ILS PRM Approach. After the clearance; I saw that his Localizer frequency wasn't tuned correctly and I verbalized he needed to switch back to the Localizer frequency. VOR/LOC was engaged prior to him switching to the localizer frequency. While he was selecting the localizer frequency; I was verifying it was tuned and I did not notice if he had re-engaged VOR/LOC. Approach switched us to Tower. As I switched frequencies and selected the Final Monitor in VHF 2 we received a TA.I saw Company turning onto their Localizer for the left runway; then I saw we had blown through our course and verbalized he needed to correct back to the right. At the same time; Final Monitor asked if we were on frequency. I responded with an affirmative; and he cancelled our approach clearance and instructed us to descend to 3;000 feet and then said to report re-established on the Localizer. The Captain disengaged the autopilot; but was not descending. I verbalized 'descend now' and I engaged Vertical Speed at a 1;000 FPM descent to give him guidance. The Final Monitor asked; 'Do you have the runway in sight?' We did. He cleared us for the approach; and I noticed the aircraft was turning left again. The Captain didn't realize he had not re-engaged the autopilot. I told him 'you are still hand flying; turn right.' At that time; the Final Monitor queried us again. 'It looks like you are lined up for the wrong runway.' I confirmed we were correcting. He issued our landing clearance. After landing; we were cleared to taxi via the [Taxiway] loop. Upon reaching Taxiway and prior to my check-in with Ground; we heard a stuck MIC on frequency. The Captain continued to taxi while I attempted to contact Ground. I contacted Ramp to inform them of the stuck MIC on Ground frequency. The Ramp Controller cleared us in and queried 'So you didn't contact Ground?' I confirmed that we hadn't because of the stuck microphone. We taxied in and parked.,B737-700 flight crew reported their aircraft overshot approach into a TA with parallel traffic. Also; First Officer reported a stuck MIC on Ground Control and was unable to make contact.

During taxi; before takeoff checklist was accomplished; incorrect weight was not caught by crew.  During takeoff; pilot flying rotated at VR (Takeoff Rotation Speed) on the FMC (Flight Management Computer) takeoff page and speed tape.  Rotation was recorded at 11.4' and tail strike occurred.  On climb out airspeed was low; stall warning activated; PM (Pilot Monitoring) called airspeed; pitch was lowered; aircraft accelerated and departure was continued.  All altitude constraints and SID (Standard Instrument Departure) routing were met.  During climb out flight attendants contacted cockpit and confirmed a tail strike.  Crew continued departure; cleared terrain; completed QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) tail strike checklist and coordinated descent from 19;000 feet with ATC (Air Traffic control).

First flight was to ZZZZ in Aircraft X. During my walk-around I took a picture of the tail skid; which had a small amount of green visible on the warning decal. I showed this to the CA (Captain) when I returned to the cockpit for SA (Situational Awareness). All phases of ground ops were normal. Captain was PF (Pilot Flying). We got to know each other more during cruise and found out we lived very close to each other. He thoroughly briefed the planned arrival and landing into ZZZZ. We reviewed all Jepps thoroughly and complied with all checklists. He flew the ILS Runway 07 to a very good landing. We had normal ground ops at ZZZZ. [The next day] when we arrived at the aircraft our FAs (Flight Attendants) from the prior day were on board. During my walk-around I found the tail skid had the same small amount of green visible on the warning decal as the day prior; so I did not take a picture as it was exactly the same as the day prior. I updated the CA with this info when I returned to the cockpit. My preflight ops were normal. I got departure clearance and final weights came in. I rejected the FMC (Flight Management Computer) takeoff data because the GW (Gross Weight) was 160.7 and the TOW (Take-off Weight) was 160.2. I requested ACARS takeoff performance for 160.7. I was expecting to do this because the CA had added on an extra 1000 fuel for weather. During pushback and engine start ACARS alerts were received by both of us and the FMC was updated. I checked the take-off data for correct altitudes. I set flaps 1 and called ground for taxi. During taxi; the before takeoff checklist was accomplished. I was verbalizing ACARS printouts on my yoke and verifying on the FMC pages. I set V2 of 130 in the speed window. I said that was a low V2. I adjusted the trim. We gave way to an aircraft crossing on 'G' as we taxied down 'A' and monitored Tower. When we got to the end of the taxiway; the CA asked if we were all caught up and I said we were. We transferred aircraft control lined up on centerline for Runway X. I held the brakes with my feet. Once cleared; takeoff roll began and I rotated at VR of 124. The aircraft felt light and different during my slow pull back on the yoke; so I slowly pulled a little more. It felt like a long time for the aircraft to lift off. I felt and heard a thump. I saw the taxiway for Runway XX to the right. Once airborne; the gear was retracted; I said that we met 3460 ft; then the CA said to watch my speed. I lowered the nose and the stick shaker activated. I lowered the nose again and we began to accelerate and continued turn and climb for ZZZZZ above 5000 ft in VNAV/LNAV. An FA called and confirmed the tail strike. We cleaned up the aircraft; accomplished the After Takeoff checklist and checked in with Departure. We wanted to get above the MSA (Minimum Sector Altitude) of 12900 ft before accomplishing another checklist. The autopilot was on and the CA started the Tailstrike checklist. We were above 18000 ft when the CA was able to coordinate a descent and fix for a holding pattern to burn fuel. We did not declare an emergency because we were unable return to ZZZZ due to our weight. Once below 10000 ft we manually depressurized the aircraft and entered a holding pattern at ZZZZZ1 at 9000 ft and 230 kts. ATC moved the holding pattern to ZZZZZ2 at 9000. In the holding pattern when the Tailstrike checklist was complete; the CA talked to the FAs; Dispatch and the passengers. The aircraft was stable - we aviated; navigated and communicated; so I started reviewing the ACARS print outs and ACARS messages. I found my error of 106.7 vice the correct weight of 160.7. I found the ACARS take off data warning message of assumed weight 106.7 less than final weight manifest of TOG 160.3. My heart sank! As weather moved in ATC reassigned the holding pattern to ZZZZZ1 at 9000 ft with 10-mile legs. We accomplished the Descent checklist and the CA briefed his approach andlanding for flaps 40 and autobrakes 3; ILS Runway X. ACARS comms were intermittent; so we manually checked landing distance for weight 146.0; applied corrections and verified runway length was greater than 7200 ft needed. The CA flew the ILS Runway X to a very good flaps 40 landing. We had normal ground ops to the gate at ZZZZ. The flight was just over 3 hours. The station wanted to know the CA's plan on what to do with the passengers. They gave the CA a message to call the Chief Pilot. I wanted to do a walk around to see the tail but moved quickly because there were so many people. There was a small amount of red visible on the warning decal on the tail skid. When I returned to the cockpit the Ops General Manager asked the CA to fill out a form and took pictures of our licenses for the [local aviation authority]. Later two [local] officials; who identified themselves as [aviation authority]; wanted information. They did not present any identifications. We asked FA to interpret. After all the passengers deplaned; they needed to move to the aircraft. We coordinated to complete our paperwork in the Operations office. We were delayed exiting Customs because the general declaration from the previous date was not acceptable and required extra coordination. After the CA completed the form for the General Manager; he helped to interpret the additional paperwork for the [local] officials who had followed us to Operations. After coordination with Scheduling we took a taxi to the hotel.,B737 First Officer reported entering an incorrect gross weight into the FMC for obtaining takeoff performance data. Subsequent takeoff resulted in a tail strike.

There was an alternate and I added 1000 lbs of fuel. The aircraft was preflighted and we briefed. The brief included taxi; terrain; engine failure/t procedures and takeoff profile. The station and ground crew were ready to close/push early. I felt as though they wanted us to push early. We did not push until 5-10 min prior push time. The takeoff data was initially rejected the GW was greater than the TOW. The First Officer entered a takeoff weight of 106.7 vice the correct weight of 160.7. Also the takeoff data was for a flaps 1 takeoff. Both engines were simultaneously started after push. The taxi is relatively short and there were only 1 or 2 aircraft waiting for takeoff. During the taxi; the before takeoff checklist was completed; the incorrect weight was not caught by the crew. We held on the taxiway for a prop aircraft to clear. We took the runway and the aircraft was given to [the First Officer]. There is an upslope [this runway]; however; I did not feel the acceleration was unusually slow. During takeoff roll the aircraft was on centerline but the runway/roll was bumpy. I called out V1; Rotate. The pilot flying initially rotated to 6 degrees at a normal rate and momentarily stopped rotation. Then the rotation continued. The pitch was recorded at 11.4 degrees and the tail strike occurred. With a positive rate the gear was raised. On the climb out I believe the pitch was high greater than 15 degrees and the airspeed was low (and decreasing). At some point during this time the stick shaker activated. I called out airspeed; [First Officer] lowered the pitch and airspeed increased. We continued climb out flying the departure; all altitude and speed constraints were met. During climb out the flight attendants contacted the flight deck and confirmed a tail strike. We continued to fly the aircraft; [after] clearing high terrain I opened the tail strike checklist in the QRH. The aircraft leveled at 19000 ft. [and] was pressurized. We coordinated with ATC for a descent first to 12000; then 10000 ft. and eventually 9000 ft. At 9000 ft. via the checklist we set the outflow valve to manual. We held as shown on the approach charts. We held to burn fuel to the max limit landing weight. We talked and decided not to landed overweight and risk structural damage. We held for over 2 hours. ATC; the company/dispatch; flight attendants and passengers were notified of our situation and intended return to [departure airport]. The aircraft landed (flaps 40 brakes 3) without further incident. The passengers were boarded off the aircraft and handled by station personnel.,B737-800 Captain reported a tail strike occurred on takeoff when the First Officer entered an incorrect takeoff weight that was not caught by either pilot.

It was then MEL'd so we had to use the APU in flight.  On our fourth leg; (ZZZ to ZZZ1) during the climb to FL410; the APU shutdown disconnecting the autopilot and leaving us with only the #1 generator.  We ran checklists; coordinated with Dispatch and contacted ATC with intentions.  We diverted to ZZZ2 [advised ATC] (since we were unsure why the APU shutdown) and landed without incident.,A B737 pilot reported that after being dispatched with an inoperative engine driven generator; the APU shut down in flight for an unknown reason; which necessitated a divert due to single generator operation.

Several passengers noticed to odor as well. The flight attendants began their efforts to determine the source and we began the 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes' Checklist. A Company Pilot was in the back and after several minutes; the flight attendants and the pilot determined the odor was increasing. We [advised ATC] and were given direct to ZZZ. I then advised the passengers of the situation and that we were a [priority] aircraft. The flight attendants prepared the cabin for landing and the First Officer and I determined a diversion to ZZZ2 was not warranted. We landed on [Runway] XXL without incident. As we cleared the runway; CFR inspected the aircraft and found the left main landing gear brakes were glowing. We proceeded slowly to the gate with CFR in tow. We called Ops to inform ground personnel to avoid the aircraft until it could be determined safe to approach the aircraft.In retrospect; I should have briefed the flight attendants in the cabin for normal landing. On final we heard the commands from the cabin; which was not warranted at that time which surprised us because I had the First Officer check on the situation just prior to base leg one more time and the odor was stable. Earlier; I had informed the flight attendants an evacuation was not warranted. Although; if I had just asked them to secure the cabin and the situation escalated; we would regret not preparing the cabin. Also; a BRACE! BRACE! BRACE! command was not warranted or given over the PA; so I am not sure the 'Heads Down Stay Down' commands were correct procedure.  There was a breakdown in communication and of overall knowledge of cabin procedures on my part to have the proper game plan in place before arrival.,B737-700 flight crew reported strong burning rubber smell throughout the aircraft resulting in an uneventful landing at destination.

Captain requested priority handing; received vectors back to airport and landed uneventful with CFR crews following us to gate.  On ground with brake fans on; temperature stayed around a max of 400/420.

Unable to visually locate the aircraft; I briefly glanced back inside at my display and saw that the intruding aircraft was just off our right side at 800 feet below. I returned to scanning for the traffic and advised ATC that it was not in sight. A few moments later; we received an 'Adjust Vertical Speed' TCAS advisory; with the intruding aircraft now displayed in red at 500 feet almost directly beneath us. The captain shallowed our descent rate; and the other pilot subsequently advised ATC that they had us in sight; although I never visually acquired this aircraft.,A319 flight crew reported an RA while on an ILS approach.

Captain asked her to keep us apprised if temperature increased while crew checked ECAM and overhead for fire; heat or smoke indications. Several minutes later; the Number 1 said it was even hotter; too hot to touch. I [Captain] asked for cart to be in place and went out to feel it as we had no other indications of an issue. It was hot but not burning. Attempted to contact Dispatch via iPad application and dispatch direct; but had difficulty and used SATCOM instead. The First Officer kept flying while I discussed with Maintenance.Maintenance explained about the NEO (New Engine Option) floor heat in front of 1L Door and we agreed it was safe to continue. 5 minutes later while deviating around storms FA 1 calls up and said she smelled electrical smoke. First Officer continued flying while also talking to ATC and used Pan Pan in accordance with procedures and [advised ATC] requesting CFR (Crash Fire Rescue). Diverted to ZZZ behind us. On the ground approximately 10 minutes later.  No excessive thermal heat noted by ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting); nor any issues noted once they boarded.  Maintenance did a complete check and was able to defer floor heat and flight continued successfully to ZZZ1.The event occurred because either the floor heat malfunctioned or the crew was not properly trained on what to expect with the floor heating system on a new airplane.Better functioning floor heat or proper crew training on the expectations of how the new floor heating system works and what it will feel and smell like for cabin crew.,A321 flight crew reported cabin floor heating system malfunction in-flight.

The Captain was already there; we said hello; [and] I did my walk around then started my preflight duties. As we were boarding; we were having the standard (where are you from) conversation. Captain told me he lives out of base and is relatively new to ZZZ. He then said he was actually thinking about changing bases soon because he can't take the attitudes of ZZZ First Officer's. Personally; I have been a ZZZ First Officer for 5 years and have never heard of a problem. Being concerned; I asked what's been going on. He never really gave me an example; but he basically said that these First Officers have a problem with challenging the Captain. Then he said that he is sure that we won't have that issue on this trip because I don't seem like that type of guy. Then he continued and told me that if I do want to play the game of who knows more; that he promises that it won't end well for me. I assured him that I don't play those games and I only speak up if it's a safety issue or I feel it necessary. And that was about the extent of my briefing from the Captain. I thought it was odd that at this day and age; my briefing was basically 'don't challenge the Captain'. I then told him that he can't hurt my feelings and to please speak up if he sees me making a mistake.At this time; Maintenance comes into the flight deck to tell us a tire that was questionable was well within their limits and that we were good to go. Maintenance questioned what guidance we had and we explained our guidance is much different than theirs; usually more conservative. I gave the mechanic the example of the hydraulic fluid quantities and their 'normal fill' range. The book states if it is at all outside of those limits; even for thermal expansion; that we are required to call Maintenance. The Captain then spoke up and said that wasn't true as they've added a note saying that as long as we don't have any ECAMs that we don't have to call Maintenance. I was surprised he said that and asked when it changed. He said it changed a long time ago; probably 6 months ago. I said that I must have missed the change and we moved on. During the taxi; we had a crosswind that was technically a 1 knot tailwind. I said ok no problem; TOGA take off and I'll go to the TPS and work the number. Captain told me not to use the TPS but to just request a new TPS using 'request T.O. Data' and put the tailwind in there. I said that doesn't work. You can compute the tailwind penalty manually or call and have a new TPS sent with the tailwind penalty added. He said 'oh really; well you're the only First Officer that seems to think that'. He then continued and told me that about 30 of his last First Officer's requested a new TPS with the tailwind. I said that I found that odd because they make it every clear in training that you cannot do this. I asked if I could just do this manually for now and we could talk about the tailwind and the TPS during our flight to ZZZ1. He agreed. As I was heads down doing the penalty; the Captain was swerving down the taxiway because he was also heads down doing the same thing. I said I'll take care of this so you can taxi. He said no it's ok; I'm good at taxiing. So a short time later; I said ok we have a TOGA take off and our penalty is 970 LBS. off MTOW. He said; not its 1;050 [LBS]. I said ok maybe I looked at it wrong. I looked again and it was in fact 970 lbs. He looked again and agreed as he saw his mistake. We were legal to take off. Once we were on our way and not busy with ZZZ; I looked up the note about the normal fill for the hydraulics. I read the note and it still says we are required to call Maintenance. I showed the Captain. He read it and was surprised that it said what it said and that he must have missed the last sentence. We moved on and I said let's look at the TPS. I said that; like the hydraulic issue; I'm looking this up for my own personal knowledge. Things change all the time and who knows; maybe [Company] pushed the button that allows us to grab a new TPS with a tailwind. So I said I'll request a new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind and see what it says. He said; we are in flight; you can't request a new TPS because we are in flight. I said sure you can and pushed the button and spit it out. I showed him the new TPS with a 10 kt tailwind compared to our original TPS and both were identical. The Captain was in the TPS flow chart in the QRH and was in disbelief that it didn't say that you could request a new TPS with a tailwind. He then said 'damn it if I'm going to lose a beer over this'. At this point; I stopped him and said the he wasn't going to lose a beer because we aren't playing a game of who knows what. There have been a ton of changes and if something as important as when to call Maintenance or how to know if we're legal for takeoff; I want to know. That was it. At this point I realized that tension was building. The Captain was irritated that I was challenging him. I decided at this point that I wasn't going to speak up unless I absolutely had to. Now one thing I didn't mention was that the Captain briefed the flight attendants to stay seated for 1 hr and 30 minutes after takeoff as a precaution because of what was left of the hurricane. We were routed around to the north of it but he still kept them down. I thought that was excessive. The ride was smooth. I didn't say anything. Nor did I say a thing when we had to deviate around cells. He would do an all call and tell everyone to take their seats. We were deviating a long way around these cells and I had absolutely no doubt that it would be a smooth ride. We even had reports from other aircraft that the ride was smooth. The other thing I felt was odd; was that less than one minute after he called the flight attendants; he was surprised that they were still dealing with their carts and not already in their seats. I honestly don't think he has any idea what the flight attendants have to do to clean up and sit down. The flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 was mostly smooth. We have specific guidance in regards to the ride quality when it comes to flight attendants and passengers.Either way we had an uneventful flight to ZZZ1 and we had good conversation. The next morning we were getting ready for our leg back to ZZZ. We were ready for departure but I believe we had to wait for traffic behind us. The Captain put the delay for pay purposes into ACARS. I was just making small talk and said I heard there was a potentially easier way of doing it that might save him time. This set him off. The Captain kept saying; almost yelling 'it's amazing when you upgrade everyone tries to prove you wrong. Just you wait; it's amazing. Everyone just tries to prove you wrong.' This little rant went on for an uncomfortable amount of time. I finally stopped him and said that is absolutely not what I'm trying to do and that I'm sorry that I somehow came off that way. I said that there have been so many big changes that it's very difficult to keep up and so easy to miss. I told him how just last month I was told that I was doing a checklist incorrectly. We looked it up and sure enough they were correct. I told him there were no hard feelings and I was glad it was brought to my attention. That was the end of that conversation.  I want to be clear the reason I wrote such detail about the events leading up to the diversion is because I think it's important and can better understand how we ended up in ZZZ2. It's my leg to ZZZ from ZZZ1. We are in a full 320. We have been airborne for less than 20 minutes. The Captain is eating his kung pow kitty as the Flight Attendant calls. She said she turned the oven on and about 1 minute later smoke started coming out. Captain asked if she turned it off and she said she did. He instructed her not to open the oven and that we are diverting. He hangs up with her; looks at me and said smoke in the cabin; we're going down now! Before I could say a word he grabs the mic and [advises ATC] and said we needed to get on the ground immediately. He then dons his O2 mask even though there wasn't even a hint of smoke or even a smell in the flight deck. Because his was on; I grabbed mine. After about 2 minutes; the Captain realized he couldn't communicate very well and he takes it off; as do I. Now I can't remember if we knew on initial contact that the oven was no longer smoking or if it was just a few minutes later. Either way; the Captain and I knew that there were dinner rolls in the oven; it started smoking 1 minute after she turned it on and that it stopped smoking as soon as she turned the oven off.I could not believe we were diverting....for toast. The Captain was busy running the smoke in the cabin checklist and I was flying the plane and talking to ATC. I strongly considered talking to the Captain and asking if we should possibly reconsider the diversion since it doesn't seem to be a safety of flight issue. Considering the way he has responded to any type of questioning; and the fact that he was currently deep in the yellow and headed for the red; if I questioned his judgement; it would have put him through the roof and that would have been very unsafe in any phase of flight; especially a diversion. I decided the safest course was to just go along with his diversion and not question him. During the diversion; he must have fired off a text to Dispatch saying we needed to divert. I don't know what his message said. Initially I suggested we turn back towards ZZZ1. So we did. I then realized we were far too heavy for the short runway. I pulled up ZZZ3 and it was too far for the Captain. At this time Dispatch responds and said to divert to ZZZ2. I plug it in and it was 40 miles to the East. I said Dispatch said to go to ZZZ2. He said that's where he wants to go also. I told ATC and we started to head that way. I slowed the plane down to give us time; changed destination and set up for the ILS. I did the landing distance for our weight and it said around 8;000 feet; we had 13;200 feet. I briefed the Captain and told him I was doing flaps full with manual auto brakes. Since we had such a long runway I was going to stay off the brakes until under 100 kts to keep them from getting too hot. I told him I already spoke with ATC and said we'd either make a right turn off or back taxi. He cut me off and said we were going to be stopping on the runway and having the trucks look us over with their equipment and look for any hot spots and to also check our brake temps. I had a nice touchdown and used the brakes as I briefed. We came to a stop and watched the trucks surround us. As we sit there we put the brake fans on; the temps never got over 220. Minutes go by and I said I'll use this time to call Tower and ask exactly where we are parking. I got snapped at by the Captain once again. He said I needed to calm down and to stop interfering with their emergency procedures. A short time later; Tower called us asking if we were ready to taxi yet. Captain responded that after the fire trucks have looked us over and checked our brake temps that we'd then be able to taxi. Tower said he were completely fine. Again; our brake temps were never above 220. Captain tells Tower we are ready to taxi and we do. There were ramp personnel waiting for us and they parked us on the ramp just before where they park the RJ's so we don't block them. Air stairs are brought to our plane and the fire fighters confirm there is no fire and they leave. At this point we haven't deplaned. Captain looked to me and said he said he was done flying and that it would be unsafe for us to continue due to the nature of the high stress emergency. I said that I think we should consider just getting fuel and continuing. Of course we needed an overweight inspection. He said we were done. So now we needed to get the passengers to the terminal. The Captain deemed it unsa,A320 First Officer reported less than optimal CRM combined with smoke in the cabin caused by dinner rolls in the oven; which ultimately led to a diversion.

Turning base to final the autopilot started crisscrossing centerline trying to establish. I took over manually and was having a hard time concentrating on flying the airplane. I felt like I was woken from a REM sleep. I had been awake for over 2 hours. I had a difficult time doing two things at once. I wasn't scanning; just staring. My FO (First Officer) and [Relief Pilot] were offering guidance but sounded like distant voices. Around 700 ft. AGL I managed to force myself to concentrate and made a pretty sweet landing and turnoff. Upon setting brakes after a short 4 minute taxi I ran back to the bathroom and threw up a significant volume. The nausea hit me immediately. I threw up several times in a bag in the crew van and also a few more times at the hotel. I don't know what happened. I think I was developing physical symptoms of illness in the terminal area. Not the nausea which hit after parking the brakes. Maybe my blood pressure dropped or something but I was mentally out of it mostly on the approach. I didn't take any medicines or supplements but I did eat 4 hours before I got sick. It was clear and a million on the approach and though I only have been in the 777 [for several months] I have flown into ZZZ a couple dozen times. I felt OK; about 80%; the following morning and just slept all day. By pickup that evening I was fine. Though my chest was very sore from dry heaving. On the approach I think I exceeded flaps 30 max speed of 170 KIAS as well. The IAS was plus or minus 15-20 knots as it was very gusty from 4000 ft. to touchdown. I also had a glide slope warning at about 1500 ft. AGL I was told but I don't remember it. I think I experienced an initial insidious physiological sensory degradation from food poisoning. As I descended onto downwind. That's all it could be. I was so sick for the rest of the evening and the vomiting started maybe 8 minutes after the awful approach I conducted. I just do not fly an airplane that bad.,B777 Captain reported feeling partially incapacitated during the final phase of flight; possibly due to food poisoning.

He described the odor localized at row 22; AC left. He further stated that one other Flight Attendant was feeling dizzy. He went on to say; that Flight Attendant was well familiar with the odor as he had experienced four previous events. We quickly established sat phone contact with Dispatch and Maintenance. I advised them that I would keep them informed; especially should the situation worsen. Shortly thereafter; the lead Flight Attendant called and said the smell was expanding to cover approximately four rows around row 22; now AC left and right. He further stated that more flight attendants were feeling ill with dizziness; coughing and headache symptoms. At this point; I made the decision; with the help of the lead; First Officer and [Relief Pilot] (he had quickly been summoned back to the flight deck from break) to return to ZZZ. I asked the Flight Attendant to keep me informed. The decision to return to ZZZ was based; in part; that the smell was localized and pax and crew had been moved out of the affected area. Shortly after informing ATC and reversing course; the Lead informed me that the majority of crew were now suffering symptoms and that one was vomiting and on O2. At that point; I made the decision to [advise ATC about a medical event] and land ASAP which was ZZZ1. At that point we were approximately 60NM north of ZZZ1 at 37;000 feet. Through CRM; duties were assigned; and we began our descent. Because we were so close to ZZZ1; the complete QRH procedure was not completed. Without being too rushed; we got the airplane on the ground approx. 25-30 minutes after the decision to [advise ATC]. A smooth overweight landing (413;000 lbs.) was accomplished with the requisite parameters entered in the logbook. After the pax were removed; our flight attendants and [Relief Pilot] were taken to the hospital for evaluation.,A330 flight crew reported executing medical divert due to 'dirty socks' odor in passenger cabin which resulted in the majority of the flight attendants experiencing health issues.

Left engine just rolled back and basically shut down. I took control of aircraft and radios as PF (Pilot Flying) and FO (First Officer) performed quick reference card and then we moved to ECAM. Left engine was shut down per ECAM then completed ECAM follow up in QRH as I took vectors back to PHX [advising ATC] and requesting Runway 08. FOB and souls were stated. After ECAM follow up was completed FO did landing assessment. Flaps 3 was briefed for single engine return. Weather was VFR. Airport was in sight and home base for both pilots. I talked to FAs (Flight Attendants); precautionary return landing was briefed and return to airport in 10 minutes. I made PA to passengers. Aircraft was slowly configured and made visual approach to Runway 08. Landed overweight at 142;200. Normal stop and right turn off. We never had fire indications and no smoke all engine indications were normal. We released fire department and proceeded to gate. On after landing inspection no noticeable damage to left engine. Left reverser remained deployed as both were selected as per operations for using both thrust reverser's on landing. Aircraft was written up for engine failure at altitude it occurred at (13000 ft.) max EGT of 792 C was noted and overweight landing noted in [logbook]. My First Officer did an excellent job and was well trained prepared and communicative!! My cabin crew did an excellent job also! Crew contacted director of PHX who is an incredible Director!! Crew was released.,A319 Captain reported a loud bang and aircraft jolt during climb out; with the left engine failing; resulting in a return to departure airport.

Checking the engine instruments I saw that Engine 2 EPR had fallen to zero thrust (1.0); and that the EPR discrepancy indications were in view. Shortly thereafter the ECAM announced (I believe) 'ENG 2 FF DISCREPANCY'. I announced the failure; checked the Quick Reference Card; then confirmed that the FO (First Officer) would continue to fly the aircraft while I performed the ECAM actions. I complied with the ECAM action; and began to search for follow up action when the FO announced that airspeed was decreasing. I broadcast a 'Pan Pan' and advised ATC that we needed an immediate descent. ATC cleared us lower and I continued to look for follow up actions; which I failed to find in the QRH - although I did find them on subsequent review. ATC advised ZZZ was nearby; and with the support and information provided by the FO I elected to divert to ZZZ; and informed ATC of that fact. Meanwhile ECAM messages for generator failure; then engine failure were displayed; and acted upon; I notified the flight attendants and the passengers; and sent a diversion message to Company Dispatch.While I was thus engaged; the FO copied the ATIS; reprogrammed the FMS for the new arrival and provided supplemental information about runway length; etc.We completed ECAM actions; reviewed the non-routine landing considerations; updated the cabin crew; performed the Descent and Before landing checklists as appropriate; and the FO executed a smooth; overweight landing. After clearing the runway we communicated with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) and confirmed that there were no unusual indications exterior to the aircraft; then proceeded to parking on the hard stand and deplaned the passengers.Event occurred due to a loss of thrust from Engine 2.Throughout the early stages of this event I was presented with multiple demands on my attention from different sources in quick succession - primarily cascading ECAM warnings. I found myself frustrated by my inability to quickly locate information in the QRH. The multiple indexes and non-alphabetical organization of the 'alphabetical' index; combined with the location of the indices several pages deep in the QRH; made it difficult to quickly confirm whether further action was required; or available; and resulted in considerable back-tracking and re-assessing. Additionally; the listing of the system (i.e.: ENG 1(2)) before each individual ECAM item makes it difficult to pick out the relevant issue; since the identification of the specific issue only begins in the middle of the listing. Under the pressure of time and stress it is far too easy to miss the particular line applicable to the immediate problem.Another issue of note is that the engine failure follow up procedure in the QRH fails to refer to the 'Drift down and One Engine Cruise' procedure located elsewhere in the handbook. Further; the initial ECAM warnings (Fuel Flow and Generator issues) failed to address the primary issue; which was the loss of thrust from the #2 engine. The actions called for during the first couple of ECAM warnings were largely irrelevant to the larger issue of the engine failure; and attempting to work through those procedures served no purpose other than to delay and distract from the more important matters at hand. When the 'ENGINE 2 FAIL' message finally displayed - and it was notably delayed - we were well into the descent; and had already decided to divert to ZZZ. The fact that the initial ECAM warnings very obviously failed to address a far more serious issue only served to exacerbate the existing stress and confusion as I sought to locate guidance for an issue that the ECAM had not identified (though I had). Given a design philosophy that prioritizes the ECAM for emergency and non-normal procedures; coupled with a QRH that is not particularly user friendly; the failure of the ECAM to annunciate the engine failure until well into the diversion was a significant hindrance to timely; correct response to this significant failure.,A320 Captain reported a loss of thrust on the #2 engine which resulted in a diversion and landing.

By the time I was back up front; the Captain and First Officer had already made communications with ATC and Dispatch to return to ZZZ. During this time; communication with the cabin crew continued. The Captain asked me to go back and check on the odor and crew. I was told the odor was concentrated on aircraft right; by the mid lavatory. As I walked towards the rear of the aircraft; it was as though I walked into a bubble of gas. Approximately 10 feet more and I was out of it. The smell was very strong and concentrated; fitting the descriptions in our QRH; [though] I would not categorize as transient (during cruise; descent and continuing until past sundown at landing). I would also categorize it as a STRONG Category A (sweet; sour; musty; dirty sock smell; irritating to the eyes). All of the cabin crew complained of similar symptoms (headache; nauseous; dizziness). Upon returning to the flight deck; I briefed the Captain and First Officer. I used periodic oxygen for the remainder of the flight as I too had some mild symptoms. The #1 Flight Attendant relocated several of the passengers. With symptoms continuing and the odor not diminishing; we decided that it was safer to land at ZZZ1. A medical emergency [was advised with ATC] and an overweight landing was executed to [Runway] XXL. Some observations were upon arrival at the gate; several emergency vehicles were inside the aircraft area. The most disturbing thing was that there was no urgency to get the passengers and crew off the aircraft.,A330 First Officer and four flight attendants reported a fume event during flight as well as experiencing health symptoms resulting in an uneventful divert. Entire crew received medical treatment after landing.

I went back to investigate. The smell was intermittent; however; it was pungent and verified by all 4 flight attendants and numerous pax in the vicinity. After concurrence with Dispatch; it was decided to divert to ZZZ1 which was below us. [Advised ATC] and we diverted. The landing to [Runway] XXL was uneventful; we were under max landing weight. After landing I checked with the flight attendants. Everything was OK; so we taxied to the pad.,A321 flight crew reported 'fuel pungent' odor in the passenger cabin resulting in a diversion.

She believed the passenger needed emergency medical attention. I returned to the frequency and advised the First Officer of the situation and that I was going to ask ATC to arrange for EMS to meet the flight. ATC acknowledged our request and gave us a vector for RUNTS and cleared us direct to the fix. As the First Officer was programming the FMC for the new clearance; I said; 'We're going to be high; I'll slow you down;' as I selected the Speed bug to the MASI UP bug. The First Officer acknowledged what I had done and I verified RUNTS on the LEGS page. The First Officer executed the change and selected LNAV. As he was doing so; ATC cleared us to 3;000 feet. The First Officer immediately called for flaps 1 because we could see that we had some excess energy; but the situation remained manageable. Just below 4;000 feet ATC asked if we had the field in sight. I asked the First Officer if he had the airport and he said he did. I called the field in sight to ATC and he cleared us for a visual approach. I felt we still had extra energy but did not say anything because I felt the situation was easily recoverable with speed brakes or landing gear. The First Officer then selected direct HOBEL on the FMC; asked for verification and executed the change. We were then immediately high on the VNAV profile. The First Officer called for flaps 5. Speed was about 200 knots and I thought we needed flaps 10/speedbrakes/landing gear. Again; I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be thought of as a micromanaging Captain. A few miles before HOBEL I finally said; 'Gear?' and the First Officer called for the landing gear. By then we definitely had excess energy. The autopilot overshot the final in the turn over HOBEL and the First Officer disengaged it and flew manually. I focused my attention inside the cockpit on glideslope proximity and airspeed. We were configured at 1;000'= feet but a little fast. I didn't call for a go-around because I was concerned about the ill passenger and we were correcting nicely. At 500 feet we were stable and I looked up to see that we were aligned with Runway 31R (the wrong runway). I called for a go-around. The go-around was poorly flown and I (finally) became much more directive; giving the First Officer headings and altitudes. We were cleared for closed left traffic. The First Officer configured early and got the aircraft slowed to 170 KIAS; but he was aware that he was descending quickly through 1;200 feet AGL much too early. I then took control of the aircraft; leveled off at 1;200 feet AGL and got the aircraft completely configured and on Speed. We completed the Before Landing Checklist and I stabilized the aircraft on the glideslope and localizer. Just above 1;000 feet AGL; I gave the aircraft back to the First Officer. The subsequent final approach and landing was within Company limits. I should have been much clearer much sooner that we were carrying extra energy. Later; I should have been far more directive in getting the aircraft slowed and configured. When the situation first happened; before I said anything to ATC about the ill passenger; I should have said; 'Let's not rush this; take your time and do this right.',B-737 Captain reported having to execute a go-around after expediting the approach due to an ill passenger.

Flight was dispatched from ZZZZ to ZZZ2 with Pack 2 on MEL. Normal take off; on climb I noticed cabin altitude at 13;000 ft.; I yelled out cabin altitude is high; emergency descent. We descended to 10;000 ft. no masks dropped. At 10;000 ft.; we assessed problem. Pack 1 now failed. I told Captain [to advise ATC] and divert to ZZZ1. Captain agreed and [sent] ACARS [message to] Dispatch. Dispatch said no; go to ZZZZ. Now we are overweight. We held for a while to burn off approximately 22;000 ft. Landed uneventfully. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) called out as well as paramedics. Cabin was getting hot. Captain kept calling FA (Flight Attendants) to check up on them and passengers due to heat in back. We landed underweight. Also no ECAM warning was ever received as pack 1 failed. No warning; no bells; no horns; etc. My ears were normal on climb out. No popping until I caught the cabin climbing.,A319 flight crew and Dispatcher reported loss of cabin pressurization due to failure of only operating pack during single pack operations.

A short time later; the #1 engine oil pressure reading dropped; turned red; and stabilized around 7 psi. Moments later; the #1 engine low oil pressure annunciator illuminated. The F/O (First Officer) remained Pilot Flying; while I; as Captain; performed the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) Checklist. The #1 engine was shutdown per the QRH. I then contacted Center; [requested priority handling]; stated our situation; and requested a divert direct to ZZZ. We were given clearance direct to the airport and descent to lower altitude. I contacted Dispatch via ACARS (Automatic Communications Addressing and Reporting System) to inform of our engine shutdown; [priority handling by ATC]; and divert to ZZZ. I contacted the flight attendants to have them secure the cabin for landing in 20 minutes. I informed the passengers of our situation and divert. The remainder of the flight involved preparing for our single-engine landing; including QRH Checklists; briefings; obtaining weather; landing performance and brake cooling data due to the overweight landing. I requested ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) meet us following a full-stop on the runway to ensure the safety of further taxi. I; as Captain; assumed pilot flying duties 20 miles from landing. Approach cleared us for a visual approach to Runway XX; and Tower cleared us to land. After stopping; ARFF inspected the aircraft; reporting no issues. We obtained clearance and taxied uneventfully to the gate. I wrote the discrepancy in the logbook; and left the aircraft with our local Maintenance Personnel. Despite [requesting priority handling]; I felt no need to exercise emergency authority. However; we did land intentionally overweight. The landing performance and brake cooling data supported that decision.,B737 Captain reported that during climb; #1 engine oil quantity dropped to zero; followed by loss of oil pressure; requiring an inflight shutdown of the #1 engine and diversion with priority handling.

I was Pilot Monitoring and the First Officer was Pilot Flying. It was a beautiful morning with clear skies and no turbulence. Suddenly we had an ECAM message 'OVER SPEED' accompanied by flashing master warning lights and a continuous repetitive chime. We accomplished the FIX strategy; with the First Officer maintaining aircraft control. We initially crosschecked our airspeed indications; but all 3 were in agreement with no abnormalities. I verified that the flap handle was up and the aircraft indicated a clean configuration. The only ECAM procedure indicated was 'VFE....235'; which was obviously impossible at our altitude. We discussed the situation and decided to execute the Unreliable Speed Indication/ADR Check procedure in the QRH. The Pilot Flying disconnected autopilot; A/T and flight directors and we double-checked pitch and power; which were appropriate for our flight regime. We did not turn off any ADRs because all flight instruments appeared normal and I did not want to 'compound' the emergency by taking the aircraft out of normal law at that time. At no time were we within 15-20 knots of Vmax.We were able to silence the repetitive chime by pushing the EMER CANC button but the ECAM message and flashing master warning light remained. I instructed the Pilot Flying to declare an emergency and turn toward ZZZ2; the closest suitable airport. In coordination with ATC; he began a descent and slowed to 280 KIAS; then 250 KAIS at 10;000 feet. I notified Dispatch; the flight attendants and the passengers; then discussed an overweight landing with the First Officer. After slowing down; the OVER SPEED warning would intermittently extinguish for a few seconds and then return (again with flashing master warning lights and continuous repetitive chime). After evaluating all relevant circumstances I determined that it was safer to land overweight than to continue flight until at or below maximum certificated landing weight. Because the OVER SPEED warning was not associated with an actual over speed condition I was concerned about possible alternative causes (e.g. an ADR problem or other unknown malfunction) that could affect aircraft controllability. The First Officer flew a textbook ILS approach to Runway XXC and executed a flawless overweight landing (185;000 lbs.); touching down at less than 200 fpm rate of descent and delaying brake application (with the brake fans on the brake temperatures never rose above 150 [degrees] Celsius after landing). We taxied to the gate; shut down the aircraft and deplaned the passengers. Aircraft mechanics arrived and conducted over speed and overweight landing inspections; finding no damage. [Maintenance Control] decided that since no actual over speed had occurred; all that was required was to reset the warning system by lowering and retracting the flaps (which the mechanics did) and the aircraft would be returned to service. I discussed the matter with the [Maintenance Control] representative and expressed my concern that this would not identify or address the actual cause of the problem. [Maintenance Control] stated that the only way to troubleshoot the aircraft would be to download and analyze the FDR data; but that the required personnel and equipment were not available at ZZZ2. They offered to reset the ADRs and Flight Warning Computers instead. At this point I told [Maintenance Control] that I would not fly the aircraft again unless further investigation was done; and made an entry in the aircraft logbook to that effect. The First Officer and I subsequently requested to be removed from flight duty for the remained of the day.,Captain reported ECAM Message OVER SPEED with all three airspeed indication reading no over speed; diverted for a precautionary landing at an airport without the technicians or equipment available to return aircraft to service; so flight crew refused the aircraft.

I told the FO to continue as the PF and also assume ATC. I would eventually assume ATC while performing the QRH. Initiated and completed the QRH without the light extinguishing. The QRH directed an engine shutdown and that checklist was also completed. [We advised ATC]; FAs (Flight Attendants) advised multiple times and with TEST; without an evacuation directed. Multiple passenger announcements made as well. During these procedures a PPOS (Present Position) hold was performed to assess the situation and initiate the checklists. A lower altitude was requested due to single engine altitude being approximately FL200. We were quite heavy; approximately 165;000 lbs. Dispatch was contacted and the decision was collectively made to proceed to ZZZ. Dispatch was queried regarding landing data; single engine at this heavy weight and the information was received expeditiously. All checklists were completed; cabin informed and advised; multiple PA's; Dispatch included; [ATC advised]. A safe and smooth landing was performed by the LCA and we were approximately 20;000 lbs overweight. Exited the runway; and stopped the aircraft without setting the parking brake. Solicited the assistance of ARFF (Airport Rescue Firefighting) to determine the condition of the gear and brakes. Some light smoke; but no fire. Decided to proceed to an area in the ramp to wait for brake cooling. Passengers and FA's constantly informed and the final passenger reception was excellent. After brake cooling; I directed a tow in to the gate. [Chief Pilot] was also contacted while awaiting for the cooling.,B737 flight crew reported an engine shutdown due to an oil filter bypass indication; resulting in a diversion to the nearest suitable airport.

On GS about 4 miles from the FAF; I requested the gear down to start the speed reduction from 210 kts to 180 kts. When the gear handle was placed in the down position; nothing happened. Three red lights appeared; but no other warnings. We cycled the gear handle with the same result.  A soft go-around was initiated and [advised ATC]. Fuel on board was 5.8. Side of Body was 111.Contact with Dispatch was established with a 'call me mayday' request. [Maintenance Control] assistance was requested to help with troubleshooting. Of note; communication was difficult as it was hard to hear them on the frequency. We switched radios to try to remedy. No help. I flew the plane and handled ATC. Captain coordinated with Dispatch; [Maintenance Control]; and the cabin crew and made the appropriate PAs to the passengers.Once we exhausted all options for an in flight remedy; the appropriate checklists were completed and a gear down-and-locked indication was achieved after the manual gear extend procedure was accomplished.  ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) equipment was requested; and dispatch contacted ZZZ operations facilitating the anticipated tow-in to Gate XX upon landing as our nose-wheel steering was rendered inoperative after the manual gear extension.ATC assigned us Runway XXR and after landing; the aircraft was brought to a stop on the centerline.  The ARFF inspected the aircraft for any hydraulic leaks and we communicated via a dedicated control frequency. The APU was started; and engines were shut down. Tow-In checklist was completed; the gear pins were installed and we were towed to the gate. Block in fuel was 3.5.,A320 pilot reported a failure of the landing gear to extend normally.

On final approach to Runway XXC; Pilot Flying called for 'gear down'. I moved the landing gear handle to the down position…three red gear unlocked lights indicated on the forward panel...gear indicated UP on the wheels ECAM page with an Amber L/G CTL message. There were no other ECAM's or warnings. Cycled the gear handle up; then back down; same indications. All hydraulic systems indicated normal. [We advised ATC and that] we wanted to be vectored out to downwind again to work a 'landing gear issue'. Designated the First Officer as Pilot Flying and ATC communicator while I advised the flight attendants and passengers. Fuel on board was approximately 6;000 lbs at this point. I referenced the L/G Gear Not Down QRH. Completion of this checklist sent us to the L/G Gravity Extension QRH. At some point here; gave the flight attendants the briefing. Discussion with First Officer resulted in consulting [Maintenance Control] (through Dispatch) to see if there were any other options prior to manual gear extension. [Maintenance Control] did not have any other actions to recommendWe reviewed the Gravity Extension checklist which stated nose wheel steering would not be available on landing. ATC; ARFF; and the [Company] station were all advised of this.  Approximately 25 miles from the airfield; we were cleared for the visual approach to Runway XXR. The landing gear was manually extended per the QRH. Flap extension and remainder of the approach and landing were normal; with the exception of nose wheel steering. The aircraft was brought to a stop on the runway centerline...brakes set...APU started; and then engines shut down. ZZZ ARFF examined the aircraft and advised there were no obvious issues. We were eventually towed to the gate with an ARFF escort. Fuel on board at the gate was 3;500 lbs.,An Airbus 320 Captain reported a failure of the landing gear to extend normally which necessitated the use of the alternate manual system to extend the gear.

We determined that we were losing oil at rate that we would not be able to continue to ZZZ1. We informed ATC (Air Traffic Control) of our intentions to return to ZZZ. As pilot flying it was now 'My aircraft; my radios' as the Captain went to work contacting everyone he needed to. We landed back at ZZZ on Runway XX below max landing weight. ARFF did a quick inspection of our engine. We shut the right engine down taxied to the gate. AML entry was made and maintenance confirmed we lost a significant amount of oil.  At some point during the climb some mechanical part of the engine must have failed to where we were leaking oil.,A319 flight crew encountered engine oil leak and returned to departure airport landed uneventfully.

[Advised ATC]; decided not to delay landing; and landed overweight. Landing was uneventful. ZZZZ emergency crews inspected aircraft; and determined it was safe to taxi to gate. Cockpit access system electronics overheated. Maintenance found system circuit breaker open.,B777-200 Captain reported a divert due to smoke in the cockpit and business class cabin area.

Shortly thereafter; they called again and said that other flight attendants smelled the electric smoke smell as did [the] passengers. We were a few miles north of ZZZ at the time and elected to divert. Both the Captain and I smelled an electric smell and donned our oxygen masks. The smell cleared in the cockpit and when we checked in with the flight attendants they said it had also cleared in the cabin. We [advised ATC] and asked for radar vectors to final approach to Runway XXR. We coordinated with the flight attendants deciding not to do an evacuation and unless we heard from them that the condition worsened; we would land normally and have the fire trucks follow us to the gate where we would deplane normally. We landed and taxied to the gate as we planned; and the smell never returned. The entire crew did a great job coordinating and executing this abnormal event.,B737 flight crew reported a fume event during cruise resulting in an uneventful divert.

I jumped out of my jump seat to investigate where the origin of the fumes may be coming from and looked out passenger window to make certain the engines were not on fire even though this smell was not of that nature. I didn't see anything. I did not see any smoke. I tried to locate the source of fumes by smelling the vents in galley and lavatory as well but found nothing. I looked to forward cabin and noticed the C Flight Attendant motioning me to pick up the handset. I picked up the handset and she told me she smelled fumes up front cabin as well. With the two of us on the handset we called the Captain and he also confirmed that the pilots both smelled the fumes up in cockpit as well. He told us if the fumes got any worse; to call him back. Within a minute or two later I couldn't breathe in the back cabin and was chugging water to keep my throat open to even breathe. I also got wet paper towels to cover my nose and mouth even though I could not see fumes. My throat and chest were burning; and I had a pounding headache and was coughing profusely. I immediately called the Captain and told him what was happening; and he told me that they were already in an [priority] landing pattern back into ZZZ and it would be another 5-10 before we were back on the ground. Before our Captain made an announcement to our passengers; I noticed that some of our passengers had emergency briefing cards already in their laps. We were back on ground in ZZZ about 10 minutes later. We stopped abruptly on the runway and were surrounded by many emergency vehicles. Our Captain made announcements to all passengers to remain seated loudly 4 times and listen to the commands of the flight attendants. We ended up going back to gate and deplaning all passengers at gate. The Fire Department came onboard and checked out the aircraft after we exited the aircraft. As a crew we all were feeling horrible and many symptoms and all the same symptoms simultaneously. Headache; nausea; burning in throat; burning in chest; dizziness; faint; shortness of breath; coughing; numbness in extremities; etc. Our Captain had the entire crew pulled from the flight duties and we all went to the hospital together to get checked out medically for anything we may have ingested as far as fumes that were making us feel so poorly. I do not know how the passengers were treated in regards to this situation. I commend the Captain and First Officer both on how they handled this situation. They were both remarkable.,B737 Flight Attendant reported strong fumes shortly after takeoff which were confirmed with the pilots and resulted in a return to departure airport. Crew were treated at local hospital.

The vibration was in excess of 9.9 on the vib display and a very noticeable vibration was felt through the airframe. We notified ATC; leveled off at 10;000 feet; and referenced the QRH for troubleshooting and guidance. The Captain was the flying pilot while I read through the QRH. The captain disconnected the auto thrust and reduced the power on the number one engine resulting in a decrease in vibration. All other engine parameters were operating in the normal range. We elected to keep the number one engine running at a reduced thrust level with the vibrations higher than usual; but within the normal range as indicated by the QRH.ATC vectored us back around to runway XXL where fire crash rescue was standing by in the event they may be needed. The approach and landing were non-issues and we landed about twenty minutes after departure; underweight at around 121;000 lbs. Fire crash rescue shadowed us back to the gate in the event they were needed. Once parked at the gate; a visual inspection of engine number one was conducted by the fire personnel; the flight crew; and maintenance; there were no obvious signs of damage or what may have caused the high vibrations.,A320 pilot reported high engine vibration and an air return.

While in gate area; downloaded flight plan weather and Jeppsen routing. Once on aircraft; made first call to Maintenance to get log book. Called Operations to get correct security form. Maintenance personnel came out to aircraft and I told him I need log book. We both looked around flight deck for log book. He left aircraft to go look for log book. Operations personnel came to flight deck to give me a correct security form. First Officer was quick called and arrived 35 minutes prior to departure. Mechanic came back and said he couldn't find log book. I was interrupted several times on flows due maintenance log and trying to get security form. Maintenance found log book prior to departure time and gave us log book. We both reviewed log book.Taxi out noticed wind sock indicated tail wind take off. Set parking brake and First Officer called Dispatcher for new numbers for Runway 36 R with 5 knot tailwind; had to call Dispatch again to get correct temperature on TPS. Completed all checklist. I was Pilot Flying. Takeoff Runway 36R just after rotation aircraft tried to abruptly yaw hard left and then to the right. My focus was on maintaining aircraft control. I queried First Officer positive rate and he said do you really want to raise gear I think we have gear problem. I was hand flying and aircraft was climbing good. We elected to maintain configuration gear down. We [advised ATC] and made right traffic for [Runway] 36C.We had no ECAM cautions or warnings or messages all systems indicated normal. Communicated with flight attendants; Dispatch and passengers. We set up for approach and briefed and accomplished checklists. Advised Tower we would be full stop on runway for inspection. On base; spoke with flight attendants again to confirm no changes plan on precautionary landing; they told me everything was good and confirmed precautionary landing. Normal landing [Runway] 36R came to stop on Runway 36R and made PA this is the Captain remain seated remain seated remain seated.Told passengers aircraft would be inspected prior to taxiing to gate. On Tower frequency communicated with Fire Chief told him we may have a gear and or engine issue; he said he heard loud bang observed back fire from our right engine on takeoff. He inspected aircraft and engines and landing gear he said we were all clear and good to taxi to gate. We shut down the right engine and checked all systems everything checked normal. Taxied clear of runway.Was told part failure on right engine. We had brief rhythmic banging. No ECAM warnings.,A319 Captain reported engine problem during takeoff; resulting in a return to land.

I immediately realized that I could smell 'something' and the flight attendants described the same observation. I immediately directed my First Officer to don O2 masks. It was a flaps-15 takeoff; so we continued the cleanup process while I hand flew the aircraft while donning my oxygen mask. We continued to fly the SID to the 4;000 hold-down; while notifying ATC of our [situation] and request for vectors for an immediate return.The remainder of the flight was uneventful. We launched off Runway 15R and recovered via a 'figure-8' left turn to downwind for the RNAV Runway 10. I touched down very gently; with the power up; because I knew that this would affect the overweight landing inspection procedure. I was easy on the brakes. The aircraft decelerated well in maximum reverse. Fire trucks followed us onto the runway and surrounded the aircraft. They looked the aircraft over and used an IR camera to examine the aircraft. After declaring no unusual observations; they then followed us to the gate.Once we donned oxygen masks; we were committed to making an expeditious recovery. Although we did not know the source or origin of the detected odors; we 'assumed the worst' and I was personally convinced that it was necessary to return as soon as possible. (I was later informed by Maintenance Control that they found a failed static inverter.)My First Officer; who is very experienced and ready for upgrade; was a great partner to fly with during this [situation]. He was eager to divide responsibilities. He flew the aircraft and talked with ATC as I read the QRC then QRH. Knowing the systems and the likelihood of the air conditioning packs as a source of trouble; I directed the First Officer to secure both packs. As we worked through the QRH; the checklist confirmed that shutting off the packs was going to be part of the troubleshooting process.We made one error which I would like to highlight for the purpose of enlightening other Crews to be on the lookout for repeating this same error: We were given quick vectors to recover to landing in a short time. This left us short on time to 'properly' prepare for landing in an orderly fashion.Adding to this self-imposed sense of urgency was the fact that we were wearing oxygen masks. The desire to 'end' the evolution with a sense of urgency led us to accept a prompt set of vectors to land. Since it was a 'Smoke; Fire; Fumes' Checklist; there is an ever-present sense of urgency and desire to get back on deck as soon as possible. This is my 'General Safety' concern.Specifically; while slowing and configuring for landing on final; approaching 150 knots; we realized that we had failed to set VREF and VARGET. This reminded us that we had not retrieved landing data via ACARS; as we would 'normally' do. My First Officer quickly selected the FMC default values; which I judged to be satisfactory; especially as we knew that we were intentionally performing an overweight landing owing to the nature of the [situation].In hindsight; I allowed the aircraft to slow without a solid plan and without having communicated a set plan for the approach. This 'speed error' was trapped; but we could have easily gotten slower; given all of the distractions. We also failed to use [weight and balance system] to gather requisite landing data. This is a procedural error; which we accepted owing to task prioritization.Needless to say; using oxygen masks is a huge and primary distraction. It makes communication of all sorts very problematic. It impedes and precludes 'normal' conversational speech to which we are accustomed. This is my first; ever experience in the 737 flying an approach and landing while wearing an oxygen mask.I think that we failed to 'assess the risk' associated with not running a normal Descent-Approach-Landing Checklist sequence. Also; because of the difficulties in communication while using oxygen masks; we restrained ourselves from speaking; excessively (or 'normally').I want to add that once we were established and had found our rhythm of breathing; then keying the MIC to speak; we felt very comfortable and confident. We both felt like we were completely unimpeded by the oxygen masks - i.e. no problems with vision obstruction or clarity nor mobility in the cockpit. It was almost like we weren't wearing them; except for the fact that we wanted to speak as little as possible!Simply put; the oxygen mask usage causes simultaneous failures to communicate; the loop is left open and the sender does not know if the receiver even heard what was said or if it was heard correctly. Once using oxygen masks; one must very deliberately repeat; interrogate and confirm that messages have been received; understood and acted upon. It takes deliberate follow-through and demands excessive communication at a time when both pilots are seeking to minimize conversation and distracting sounds/noises.,B737-800 flight crew reported a fumes event shortly after takeoff resulting a return to departure airport.

With that said;How can I verify this for transparency; for each aircraft that I am flying on?1. ZZZ-ZZZ1; Flight # XXXX Serious illness work environment safety concern. After two hours of flying on this aircraft I started experiencing chronic symptoms (Listlessness; Headaches; Fatigue;) are just some of the symptoms I was experiencing as well as C-Flight Attendant and the inbound B- Flight Attendant briefly told me of her illnesses she was experiencing as well. I noticed that when we were on the ground and the galley doors were open; the symptoms went away. This continued all day to the point that I thought I was going to have to call scheduling to be pulled. I believe that this aircraft should be examined for whatever made me and my colleagues work environment physically fatigue.2. ZZZ2-ZZZ3; Flight # XXXYThe crew experienced jet fumes from the aircraft on takeoff from ZZZ2. When we landed in ZZZ3; the A and B Flight Attendants brought it to my attention how severely heavy the fumes they experienced on takeoff. These fumes weren't as heavily present in the back of the aircraft as the A and B Flight Attendants were experiencing. These aircraft fumes side effects caused me to experience a slight headache and pain in my eyes.3. Flight # XXXZ; ZZZ4-ZZZ5After 45 minutes into this flight; I started feeling symptoms; headaches; eye pain; feeling if I was going to faint; and nauseous. No; I am not pregnant! I woke up that morning feeling perfectly fine. Like I said before; the symptoms didn't start until 45 minutes after my first departure. The odor didn't appear to be as prevalent to me as it were for the inbound crew. I'm sure that whatever product they use to disinfect the carpet for that aircraft probably contributed to my temporary illness. In between flights I would step off the aircraft to get fresh air; this helped alleviate the symptoms and when my shift was over and I was off the aircraft I noticed the symptoms disappeared; so I know for a fact that the aircraft cabin environment was causing my symptoms.,Flight Attendant reported three prior fume events resulting physiological issues.

I; at the same time; smelled a 'Dirty socks odor'. This is the 2nd time that in flight I have smelled this odor. [The First Officer] called the flight attendants and they reported the same odor FWD and Aft in the cabin. I told the [First Officer] to don his O2 mask and put mine on also. As I was the Pilot Flying; I handled ATC and flew while [the First Officer] contacted Dispatch through ACARS and sent a return to field message. I told ATC we needed to return to ZZZ and was quickly given a vector back to ZZZ. I noticed my mask's face shield was rather cloudy/dirty and hard to see out of. We returned fairly quickly. At 1;000 feet AGL I had to remove my mask in order to see well enough in order to land the aircraft. My mask was off for approximately 5 minutes. After clearing the runway and stopping I put my mask back on. We taxied to a gate where we were met by paramedics.After deplaning and speaking to paramedics on the jetway; I noticed several symptoms. I felt dizzy and lost my balance approximately 4 times; where I had to hold the wall of the jet way to steady myself. I could think of what I wanted to say but the word would not come out of my mouth. I could talk but not say exactly what I wanted to. I also had a sore throat. I felt disoriented and overwhelmed. I finally sat down on the edge of the jetway. I saw three men in suits standing together a little ways further up the jetway. None of them introduced themselves or offered any assistance. The whole crew was taken to [a local hospital] by ambulance. I was released approximately 5 hours later. I have had multiple health affects since that day. It was determined that the APU had an internal oil leak. The aircraft had another fume event on the line during passenger operations on a [recent flight]. This is an ongoing and known problem. This problem can be addressed by taking seriously the health risks caused by TCP (Tricresyl Phosphate) in the engine and APU oil. The Airbus aircraft have a high risk to the bleed air system because the APU air inlet is on the bottom of the aircraft and is easily able to ingest oil into the bleed air system where it is heated up and can enter the cabin and cockpit as a neurotoxin. To this day; I have no memory of actually landing the aircraft.,A319 Captain reported a fumes event shortly after takeoff which resulted in an uneventful return to departure airport. Captain experienced physiological issues which were treated at local hospital.

It ruined a couple settings as well. I was completely blinded and in shock for the first two minutes my eyes and my face were burning and I was shaking with fear; pain and shock. After I realized what happened I immediately called the crew and FD (Flight Deck) and grab some ice and towels. I went to the lavatory to assess my face hands and arms. I have burns and will continue to treat myself until I finish this trip. I was up until XA:00 am doing laundry of my uniform van was at XI:00 am. I noticed many red burn spots on my face; hands and arms. My eyes still sting and are red. I will seek medical treatment when I get home from this trip if symptoms worsen; I will get help right away.We need to be incredibly careful and vigilant about opening the thermos of soup. I believe this experience will and should warrant a service/safety bulletin immediately.,Flight Attendant reported a soup canister exploded as it was being opened and resulted in burns.

A few minutes later she calls back to advise me that several other passengers are also noticing the same smell and that it is coming and going. At that time; we decide to divert to nearest airport.

We also had a [deadheading] FO in the main cabin during this flight and event. I briefed all my FA's before the passengers boarded as I do each and every flight. FO did the walk around no issues noted. Logbook review noted #4 tire replaced on [date]. Later review of logbook while completing abort info noted the #2 brake assembly was replaced 10 days prior to this flight on [date]. All briefs; checklists; engine start; ramp taxi and ground taxi to Runway XXR was completely normal. Tower issued us takeoff clearance and I taxied the aircraft onto the centerline and gave [FO] the aircraft. It was his takeoff and leg to ZZZ1. He flew the leg to ZZZ2 to start the trip sequence and I flew the return leg to ZZZ.Takeoff roll; engine power setting and acceleration all normal to 80 knot callout. Immediately after that the aircraft pulled/yawed to the left and [FO] returned the aircraft to runway centerline with right rudder. Wind was down the runway so this was somewhat unusual. Shortly after 100 knots the aircraft pulled/yawed even more violently than before to the left and this time I heard some kind of noise from the left side. My initial impression was a possible blown tire or some kind of mechanical malfunction based on the sound I heard. Our FO [deadheading] in main cabin told me afterward he felt the aircraft yaw two times and heard the same mechanical malfunction noise on the second pull/yaw as well. [FO] again used more right rudder to realign the nose of the aircraft to the runway centerline and simultaneously stated out loud 'Something is wrong.' We were approximately midfield and 135 -140 knots and I elected to reject the takeoff based on the second more severe pull; sound and [FO]'s statement of the aircraft's condition. I announced 'Abort; Abort; Abort' (as I said I might say on our first leg initial brief just because that is what I have used in my aviation career) and 'My Aircraft.' The abort was instantaneous with the throttles pulled to idle. The ground spoilers deployed immediately and the autobrakes grabbed on just like a 'max brake' landing. With very little correction runway centerline was maintained during the abort procedure and brake chatter started around 100 knots on the deceleration. I elected to override the brakes due to anti-skid cycling and manually stopped the aircraft on centerline around 8500 feet down the runway. [FO] contacted ZZZ Tower announcing our abort. After the aircraft was completely stopped I made a PA to both the FA's and passengers. This was my first high speed abort in my aviation career and I am sure for [FO] and the FA's as well. We asked Tower if they could see if we had a blown left tire. They said no.  No blown tires; no hot brakes; no fluids and no damage to our aircraft [was reported]. After communicating with ZZZ OPS for a ramp/gate we [were] cleared to taxi to the ramp. The aircraft didn't move. Attempted to taxi again with no movement. I cycled the parking brake (which has NOT been applied during this entire event and never was until aircraft shutdown) just to be sure it was NOT engaged somehow. Informed Ground Control we would have to call for a tug and get maintenance assistance. ZZZ OPS was notified of our situation. During the 20 minute wait we contacted our Dispatcher about our rejected takeoff on Runway XXR. We didn't need any further assistance from him at that time. Maintenance arrived with ZZZ Maintenance Supervisor hooking up on the ground headset. He and I communicated for the next 30 minutes or more on the remainder of procedures they tried. First they confirmed no flat/blown tires; no hot brakes; no fluid leaks and no damage. They had me 'pump' the brakes while brake technicians looked over our wheels. Second they hooked up a tug and tried to push the aircraft backward to either release the brakes or remove any debris from failed brakes. No movement. Then they tried to pull the aircraft forward. No movement. We 'pumped' the brakesagain and tried a second time with the tug. No movement. Supervisor said the brakes may have failed; fused; locked or been damaged somehow. He also stated we have had many similar situations with these particular brakes in the past. I explained to him what we felt and heard during the takeoff roll. He said he expected to find some kind of failure after they performed an inspection.Supervisor and I communicated more about the AML write ups for the abort and the aircraft info that needed to be included. He was outstanding in communicating what was happening under our aircraft and later what they found with the #1 and #2 brakes. We rejected our takeoff between 135 and 140 knots; our weight was 153;000 LBS. and our fuel weight was 24;000 LBS. I rejected the takeoff because of many quick decisions. A) The aircraft yawing/pulling left (harder the second time) with the unusual noise either a blown tire or mechanical failure; B) [FOs] direct comment 'Something is wrong' justified the aircraft was unsafe to fly in my opinion and C) We were halfway down [the runway] approximately 15 knots below V1. [FO] and I were shown brakes #2 by the Maintenance personnel who already had the aircraft on jacks left side and wheel #2 off. There are 5 or 6 brake elements and the outer two could rotate but inner 3 or 4 damaged; fused or failed somehow. The mechanics suspected that brakes #1 were going to be the same. Later [name] told me that in fact brakes #1 were the same failed; fused or locked. We were called by ZZZ Chief Pilot on Duty who came down and debriefed with me. We contacted Crew Tracking and informed them we were finished for the night. [Deadheading] FO later contacted me about this entire rejected takeoff event. He confirmed to me exactly what I recalled during this abort and he told me he actually expected us to abort the takeoff based on what he felt and heard sitting back in main cabin. He also verified how professional our FAs performed and interacted with our passengers during the entire time. My thanks to [our] First Officer. He was on top of everything helping with decisions and doing most of the communications.I suspect that there was a brake failure on either or both of the left side brakes #1 or #2 during our takeoff roll based on the aircraft diversions from runway centerline in a very noticeable pull or yaw two different times as the aircraft accelerated. Also the noticeable noise that I heard from the left side of the aircraft during the second more pronounced aircraft pull/yaw. We occasionally get a rejected takeoff scenario in our [recurrent] training that may be given with a 'blown tire scenario.' I; personally; have never experienced a blown tire either. I believe we have many documented cases of blown tires with aircrews on both takeoff and landing. I also believe we have had 737 brake failures of many different kinds either during taxi or takeoff/landing rolls. We might need more discussion about the feel; sounds and expectations associated with both of these type of events because I believe most of our [Company] aircrew have never experienced either of these events as well.,B737-800 Captain reported an RTO due to a brake failure/seizure.

At about 1 hour into the flight; the humming and vibration tone would momentarily lower; as if an electric motor was struggling; followed shortly by an electric burning smell. The sound and smell would resolve in seconds. These episodes happened 3 times until it the tone of the hum dropped permanently; followed by much stronger and persistent electrical burning fumes. We donned oxygen masks; [advised ATC]; and informed ATC that we were diverting to ZZZ1. A minute later we received an ECAM caution for VENT EXTRACT FAULT.ATC gave us a heading to fly and a descent towards ZZZ1. Pilot Flying prepared for the approach while Pilot Monitoring performed Smoke/Fumes/Avionics Smoke QRH procedures. Pilot Monitoring also performed Overweight Landing QRH.ZZZ1 Tower cleared us to land [Runway] XXL and we touched down and stopped on the runway without incident. We were inspected by Crash Fire Rescue by thermal cameras to determine if we had a fire or other threat coming from the avionics bay. They reported there were a 'few hot spots' but nothing they deemed dangerous.We cleared the runway and proceeded normally to the gate.It was determined by ZZZ1 Contract Maintenance that the Avionics Bay Extract Fan had seized and was the source of the noise and fumes.There is a noticeable trend of MEL and NEF items on these aircraft. These airplanes need more thorough maintenance checks and adequate time on the ground to find preventable failure points like this.,A319 Captain reported executing a diversion due to electrical burning smell accompanied by an apparent Avionics Exhaust Fan failure.

She was instructed to check out the area. She did not notice anything at the time. A few minutes later she called and said that multiple passengers were again smelling something electrical burning. The decision was made to divert. Dispatch was contacted and the diversion went without incident. Fire crew met the aircraft and observed no external issues; then boarded the aircraft to confirm the cabin was safe. Shut down and disembarking was normal from that point on.,B737 First Officer reported that during cruise a Flight Attendant notified them of a 'burning smell' in the passenger cabin; which resulted in an uneventful diversion.

The adult women were rude to the Flight Attendants. The Flight Attendants (with many years of experience) felt they saw several indications of human trafficking and notified the flight deck of their observations. The flight deck contacted Dispatch and the Flight Operations Duty Officer and declared a Level 1 security situation to Dispatch. Dispatch advised the arrival station (Tampa) of our onboard situation and that a Ground Security Coordinator would meet the flight on arrival. The rest of the flight and arrival proceeded without incident; and Tampa airport police and the Ground Security Coordinator met the flight at the gate. The flight crew was not advised of any further issues and finished post flight duties normally.,B737 Captain reported that Flight Attendants believed they saw a child who was the possible victim of human trafficking.

I asked the First Officer to get the fire extinguisher ready and I donned my oxygen mask. Shortly thereafter; the window popped and shattered. I called for the window overheat QRH and [advised ATC]. After the situation stabilized; we advised ATC that no assistance was required and briefed the Flight Attendants; Dispatch; and Airport Operations.,B737 flight crew reported a flight deck window failed; resulting in a diversion.

We decided it was a flameout and ran the QRH procedure for Engine Fail Checklist. We notified Approach Control and [Requested Priority Handling]; completed the checklists and asked for vectors to Runway XX. At this point everything ran as normal and after a successful landing we taxied to the gate without any further incident. Igniter's need to be checked by Maintenance as we were told it could have been a failure of both igniter's on the affected engine.,B737 First Officer reported loss of #2 engine N1 and N2 with a #2 engine failure light during descent.

The engine still had N1 rotation with no fuel flow. I [advised ATC] and asked for delay vectors to run our QRH engine failure checklist. We did one box pattern in doing our checklists and headed into land. Switching from Runway 7R to the longer Runway 8. On final I sent a quick ACARS to Dispatch we had an engine failure. Since we were task overloaded I gave the arrival check late. Which was on our way inbound on final. I finally had time to talk to the flight attendants but they were doing their arrival announcements. So I chimed them 4 times. The A continued with the announcement and I believe I talked with the B. I informed him we had an engine failure; it would be a normal landing and would we will be on the ground in 5 mins. The A called back up under sterile cockpit and talked with my First Officer. He asked what he needed to do. My First Officer said nothing we were landing normally just with one engine.We landed uneventfully on Runway 8 and taxied off. We stopped to run the [manual] for brake cooling. I talked with the fire chief and told him we didn't need any assistance. The numbers came back that we could taxi to the gate. Which we did. I didn't inform the passengers of the engine failure since I didn't feel the need to since we train for the situation and it's not a big deal and didn't want to cause alarm.The engine failed do to a fuel nozzle filter assembly had broken loose starving the engine of fuel thus causing the engine failure. We didn't chose to restart the engine since we were so close to the airport and it wouldn't have.,B737 Captain reported a failure of the engine fuel nozzle filter assembly during descent; resulting in an engine failure.

The SD screen showed blue hydraulic level was nearly empty; well into the amber (though still with 3;100 PSI of pressure in the blue system). We followed the ECAM actions and turned off the blue engine and electrical hydraulic pumps. Shortly thereafter; we received another ECAM for HYD B RSVR LO AIR PR; as well as loss of the blue system pressure. We went through the ECAM procedures; then contacted Dispatch and Maintenance; brought the Relief Pilot back to the flight deck; looked through the FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) and QRH; and decided that the unexplained loss of fluid; complete loss of blue hydraulics; and our proximity to ZZZ made an air turnback the prudent course of action. ATC was notified via CPDLC; we [requested priority handling] and were routed back to ZZZ. The Captain spoke to the flight attendants and the passengers; and the Relief Pilot and dispatch both did landing distance calculations. We used an early descent; speed brakes and an early gear drop to burn additional fuel and ensure we landed under max weight. After landing; we were met by emergency trucks who verified there was no additional leakage under the aircraft; then we taxied to the gate; being pulled in by the tug as a precaution.I thought the process worked as well as could be expected. The Captain solicited input accordingly and demonstrated good leadership. The cabin crew; dispatch/maintenance and ATC all did a very good job accommodating the air return and planning accordingly. I felt like we all worked together to mitigate the risk of the malfunction and bring the plane safely back to ZZZ.,A330 First Officer reported loss of hydraulic system pressure during cruise; resulting in a diversion.

I suspected oil gulping; but the oil quantity in ZZZ was 95% and I thought that that condition happened with lower oil quantity. I had the flight attendants visually check the engine for anything abnormal; i.e. fluids. They noted nothing unusual. I coordinated a phone patch with Dispatch to discuss the situation and options. Dispatch conferred with Maintenance Control regarding the low oil quantity. Based on the absence of any further abnormal indications; the decision was made to continue. I continued to advise Dispatch of further decreases in oil quantity via ACARS messages. The First Officer; a probationary Pilot; did an outstanding job flying the aircraft and handling ATC COMMS throughout these stages of the flight. Ultimately; the oil pressure started to fluctuate. I; again; contacted Dispatch for a diversion. We decided on ZZZ1. I coordinated diversion to ZZZ1 with ATC and informed the light attendants and passengers. On descent; the fluctuations worsened with decreasing average pressure. I [advised ATC.] Shortly thereafter; pressure dropped to 'red line' with Low Oil Pressure light. I took control of the aircraft and the First Officer assumed ATC communications. Per QRH procedures; we conducted an engine shutdown. We advised ATC that we were single engine. Given the position on approach; increased tasking required for the engine shut down and single engine landing and expecting an uneventful landing; I did not notify the flight attendants or Dispatch that we were single engine. The landing was uneventful. After taxi back to the gate; I contacted Dispatch to advise them of the single engine landing and [priority handling]. The Chief Pilot pulled the rest of our flying for the day and we deadheaded home; which I think was an excellent idea. I wrote up the 'discrepancy' and overweight landing in the logbook.,B737-700 Captain reported loss of engine oil pressure that resulted in an inflight shutdown and precautionary landing.

The A Flight Attendant came to the back and said she couldn't see due to the customers (full flight). We decided to ask them to get up we needed to observe something. We had to ask 3 different rows of passengers in order to fully observe the entire engine casing. We reported we didn't see any oil that looked fresh. We all agreed to stay informed of any changes and continue to watch for any oil. We then got a call from the Captain to suspend service. Things were declining and he was on the radio with Dispatch approximately and hour from my understanding. We all three shut down galleys and double latched in preparation for things to possibly not improve. We then got a call we were diverting.We contacted the cockpit as to inquire what actions to take. The Captain was still on radio with dispatch. Clean up and be seated was all he was able to relay as they were very busy. We gathered our planned emergency cards and reviewed our responsibilities to be prepared for the worse. I messaged my family with 'I love you' just in case things turned out bad. Our descent was abrupt due to the air breaks. The customers were deeply concerned and asking questions. The internet was turned off. The cabin was quiet and things felt very surreal and tense. We made our landing safely and stopped for a bit on the runway; then taxied to the gate. Our pilots were pulled and scheduled to deadhead. No one contacted the flight attendants AT ALL. We were sent to gate XX to continue on with our day on a different aircraft. Our C Flight Attendant was visibly shaken; her knees felt weak and she was on the verge of crying. She called scheduling and Company Communications System and she was pulled when we arrived in ZZZ. After speaking with the Captain who was deadheading; he came to speak to us during the flight to ZZZ. After finding out how dire the situation was and how rapidly things declined; that he shut down our engine; it hit me.I began to tremble; I became very distraught that we were not taken into consideration of how this may have affected us. We worked the flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 in a daze. My service was horrible. My thoughts were everywhere and I felt extremely distraught when we learned neither Dispatch nor anyone else EVER inquired about the Flight Attendant crew. I couldn't think and fought back my tears. I can tell you our crew WAS affected. It was frightening and intense. I was made aware that the Company Communications System told our C Flight Attendant that they were told there was NO impact on the flight attendants. NO ONE asked. Our A Flight Attendant lost her place in the opening PA on the segment to ZZZ due to the stress. We could not think. If there is an incident and pilots are pulled the entire crew should be given the same consideration. I would like to believe we are just as valued as them. It is after all our job to get these people out should it come to that.We all are a crew; we all are in this together as a crew; every one of us should be valued and cared about equally. With the initial event the adrenaline kicks in along with our training you can put on your A game. Once the event is over and the adrenaline has subsided; the incident along with all the possible outcomes begin to sink in along with the anxiety; fear; and associated post traumatic issues. Then you are hustled over to carry on and work another flight. What state would a crew be in to handle another event? If one crew member is pulled we all should receive the equal.,Flight attendant reported being required to work after a flight diverted due to an engine failure; causing emotional distress.

This was confirmed by a flight deck crew member. We air interrupted and returned to ZZZ [advising ATC]. The smell confirmed to dissipate after selecting recirculating fans; gasper switch and lFE/seat switches to off. A successful over weight landing was completed in ZZZ. Possible failure of recirculating fans contributing to strong electrical smell with unusual sounds. No suggestion except to say flight deck crew and cabin crew performed duties as true professionals.,B777-200 Captain reported  'strong electrical burning fumes' accompanied by 'unusual noises.'

The FO (First Officer) was the Flying Pilot on this leg. The FO asked first; if I smelled smoke. I said I did. I finished the after takeoff checklist and called the flight attendants on the inter-phone and asked if the ovens were on and asked if they smelled anything. I think at first they said no and the ovens were off. I turned on cockpit dome light to see if I could see smoke. I could not. The FO said he is going on oxygen. I said good idea. I called the flight attendants again and now they smelled something burning. I told them we are turning around and we'd be on the ground in a few minutes.I [requested priority handling with ATC] and put on my oxygen mask. The FO took over the radio and told ATC we need to return to ZZZ. I was having trouble communicating to the FO. He was on oxygen and head set; I was on oxygen and speaker. I heard ATC clear us direct to ZZZ. I tried to change destination in the FMGC. It was not immediately apparent to do this so I instead put in direct to ZZZ. I then put on my head set and confirmed communicating with the FO. [It] wasn't until this point that I actually stated you have the aircraft and radio. I sent an ACARS to Dispatch. All I had time to text was [7700 ZZZ SMOKE].I finally loaded ZZZ as a new destination and I put in XXL in the FMGC then asked what runway he wanted. He ask for XXR. I changed it to XXR. He asked me for direct ZZZZZ. The FO asked if I wanted to drop the mask for passengers. I said NO - I explained why later. ZZZZZ wasn't line selectable so I gave him ZZZZZ1 instead. I took over the radio and notified ATC that we were now direct ZZZZZ1. I asked ATC to have Crash Fire Rescue meet us on the runway. I saw we were below 3;000 feet; so I switched the weather radar off and put terrain on and asked FO if he'd like 2;200 feet in the altitude window for the approach fix floor instead of 2;000 feet. He said yes.At about 1;000 feet AGL; Tower asked us to switch to XXX.XX to speak directly to CFR (Crash Fire Rescue). I also started the APU at about 800 feet and called XXX.XX. We landed and stopped straight ahead on the runway. I commanded the FO to say REMAIN SEATED on the PA. He did I think three times. I asked the CFR guys to check us out and use the heat gun for hot spots. I set the parking brake and took off my mask. The FO took off his mask. I tried to call the FAs (Flight Attendant) but there was too much side tone to hear because [of] our oxygen mask; though off; were on intercom. I needed to know if we had actually smoke or fire so I directed the FO to jump in the back and have a look.CFR called as soon as the FO left the flight deck and said no fire or hot spots but a little smoke from bottom of engine one. I shut engine 1 down normal. No flight deck indications of smoke or fire at any time. Just smell. I got the speaker set and intercom off and talked to FAs. They said everything was okay. I made my first and only PA explaining CFR around us. With the FO back we decided to taxi to the gate with CFR to follow. The smoke smell was gone. With engine two running we started to taxi and I turned the APU bleed on to run both packs. The FA called and said the smoke smell is back so I decided to shut off all bleed air switches front engines and APU. The CFR guys called taxing up to gate and said we have a small hot spot under our APU. I shut down engine two at the gate. We got ground power and shut down the APU.The CFR and Maintenance guys came into the flight deck right after we did the parking checklist. I called Dispatch on the phone; then the [Chief Pilot]; [and] then [Technical Support Maintenance Control]. We deplaned the passengers normally at the gate. I never saw the people. By the time I got out of the flight deck it was crew. We debriefed with the flight attendants; CFR and Maintenance. It should be noted I never actually wrote the aircraft up. [Technical Support Maintenance Control] said the FMGC timed out and they would take care of it. I did complete and fill out a maintenance smoke checklist for them.,A319 Captain reported smelling smoke in the cockpit and elected to return to departure airport.

Since it was safety related; I called the Captain under 10;000 feet.  He said he would get back with me shortly. When he contacted me; he stated we were returning to the gate and to do prepare the cabin for a normal routing landing back in ZZZ. The flight deck was on oxygen masks. Flight attendants passengers were having difficulty breathing from the intense fumes throughout the cabin. The oxygen masks should have been deployed to aid with the breathing difficulties we were having in the cabin. We were exposed to intoxicating fumes in the cabin and flight deck for approximately one hour. The oxygen masks should have been deployed in order to assist with breathing under these conditions.,A330 Flight Attendant crew reported to the pilots 'intense fumes' in cabin immediately after takeoff.

I noticed that the cabin duct temperature had gotten to 25 degrees C. I turned the passenger cabin temperature to cooler. Not long after that the flight attendant calls back and says she sees and smells smoke around the exit row that filled the ceiling. The passengers noted this as well. She described it as a fine mist that smelled like electrical wires burning. The Captain then went back to investigate. He could also smell the burning smell but the smoke had dissipated. After he returned to the cockpit we discussed returning to ZZZ or going to ZZZ1. We decided to do a bit of troubleshooting to be able to give maintenance more information when we landed. Since we had been using the engine anti ice during climb we wondered if the smell had come from that system. The Captain then went back into the cabin and gave a signal to the flight attendant for me to turn the anti-ice back on so he could observe whether there was any more smoke or smell. He did notice some additional smoke and burning smell. After he returned to the cockpit he [notified ATC] and coordinated with Dispatch to divert to ZZZ1. We requested that the fire trucks be waiting for us. We landed in ZZZ1 about 25 minutes later with no incident.,B737 NG flight crew reported Flight Attendant notification of cabin electrical fumes and associated smoke in passenger cabin.

Noting there was no loss of thrust and the engine temperature was not excessively high; we requested a heading from ATC and a climb to 5;000 feet. We followed the ECAM procedure and after reducing thrust to idle in the first step; the ECAM cleared. There was also a write up from the previous flight for one of the Engine Fire loops so we quickly discussed if that may have factored into the issue. Upon reaching a safe altitude; airspeed; and configuration; the Captain increased power in the Number 1 thrust level and we noticed no issues with the engine. It was. A few moments later; with both thrust levers in the climb detent; we attempted to climb and when the engines returned to full power; we noticed the Number 1 EGT slowly creeping up towards 790 degrees; about 40-50 degrees higher than the Number 2 engine. The engine Fire ECAM returned again and the Captain pulled back the Number 1 thrust lever which rectified the situation again. We decided to divert to ZZZ1. We ran all appropriate checklists; including the overweight landing checklist and a landing assessment. The Captain made an uneventful landing on Runway XXR and; after an inspection by the fire department; taxied to the gate.,A321 flight crew reported Engine 1 Fire Warning on climbout.

Approaching approximately 4;000 ft. ATC issued a Traffic Warning 'pop up traffic 5 miles 4;000 ft. converging; moments later I had visual on the traffic and requested a hard right turn to avoid. We turned approximately 90 degrees right. When clear of traffic we were vectored left turn back to the airport. The First Officer (Pilot Flying) who was familiar with the airport said he had the airport I called the field insight and we began approach to Runway 4. Initially we were on glideslope and PAPI but no Localizer. I verified that ILS frequencies were correct. Then glideslope started showing us low still on PAPI. I concluded something was amiss and called for a go around with ATC. ATC said they suspected we were lined up on Runway 5 at GHY approximately 10 miles to the west with no previous warning. We were given vectors back to a 19 miles downwind cleared to OXBY and cleared ILS Runway 4 at GSP. Approach and landing was normal and standard. I canceled IFR clearance on the ground (Tower was closed) and continued to the gate.There were several circumstances that contributed to this event; first and foremost was the traffic alert at low altitude that required evasive action. After being turned back to the airport a bit task saturated led to some navigational and situational awareness being a bit behind. This is why I elected to initiate a go around. This gave us the crew time to set up the approach with no traffic distractions and conduct a normal standard approach and landing to the airport. In addition this was the First Officer flying first line trip after completing IOE with 29 hours in the B737. As pilot monitoring; I needed to be more attentive than flying with a pilot with more experience. Had the Tower been open and operating may have also helped in this situation.,B737 Captain reported distraction and workload due to a traffic conflict that caused them to line up with the wrong runway.

The smell is hard to describe but I thought it smelled like a sort of chemical burning smell. Or like iron. It kinda smelled like how blood tastes. A girl in the cleaning crew smelled it as well and thought it was strange. After the safety demo; The B and C FAs (flight attendants) told us they smelled something in the aft galley. The A and I went back to check it out. We all got headaches. We smelled in the oven; lavs; and vents and determined the smell was not coming from them. The passengers did not seem bothered. Together; we determined it was safe to fly. Once in the air; the smell did not go away and headaches persisted. I experienced chest tightness and a few short breaths twice while I was in the trailing edge/aft on the cart. My symptoms cleared up about an hour before landing. I experienced chest tightness and a few short breaths twice while I was in the trailing edge/aft on the cart. Make sure this is not an air quality issue.,B737 Flight Attendant reported fumes of 'burning chemical or iron' during preflight which persisted during flight. Entire Flight Attendant crew experienced temporary physiological symptoms.

An A320 was given clearance to cross the landing runway from right to left when I was approximately 900 ft. AGL. Crossing aircraft was slow to cross and cleared the landing runway when I was 100-200 ft. AGL. During flare with thrust levers at idle the aircraft rolled uncommanded to the left. I countered the roll with right aileron correction and a balloon ensued. I chose to go around at that point; but due to energy state; engine spool up time and ground proximity the main landing gear touched down before becoming airborne again. Almost immediately after becoming airborne we got master caution alerts and ECAM advisories of flight control malfunctions. Being the Pilot Flying I maintained control and asked what was going on. FO (First Officer) informed me that the autopilot was inoperative and he believed us to be in Alternate Law. We cleaned up the aircraft and both verified the ailerons were inoperative on the F/CTL page and roll control was available via spoilers. The aircraft had reverted to Alternate Law and was verifiable by indications on the PFD.I gave FO the responsibility of flying the aircraft and ATC as I referred to QRH pg 62 F/CTL L(R) AIL FAULT. The procedure simply states that if both ailerons were deflected we would use more fuel. I did a landing assessment with our current state and verified we needed approximately 5700 ft. of runway. I [Requested Priority Handling] and since I had no idea why we were in Alternate Law; I felt the safest course of action was to return ASAP to ZZZ for a landing as opposed to trying a computer reset. I had full roll and pitch authority and didn't know what would happen if I tried to reset the computer; nor did I know which ELAC was inoperative. A normal approach and landing was made to Runway XXL. No limitations were exceeded. I attribute the whole scenario to the slowly crossing aircraft. I have never had an uncommanded roll in the flare during landing. From now on if a crossing aircraft has not cleared the landing runway by the time I get to 400 ft. AGL I will initiate a go around.,A321 Captain reported a go around after an uncommanded roll at 100 ft. AGL and loss of an ELAC.

The painted red plastic cover was missing and the bottom appeared scraped. The indicator decal on the skirt of the tail skid was showing green. The aircraft proceeded through the flight without disruption and arrived without further incident. As the damage went unknown through the flight; if it had been we would have executed the procedure established in the QRH directing us to depressurize and land at the nearest suitable airport.Upon further review of performance details and recollection regarding the flight afterward; it appears as though the aircraft was in an overweight situation on takeoff. I have recalled at the beginning of climb; the stick shaker vibrated very briefly and back pressure was decreased to compensate for this abnormality. When executing performance inputs via the company iPad performance software; both pilots verified the input details and CG corrections and the software accepted it. The corresponding data was entered into the FMC and reviewed by both pilots.ATC had advised us through a relay from the Panama departure ATC of a possible part left on the runway and were unable to provide a description. As there were no tactile indications or other; the damage to the tail skid went unknown until postflight checks were completed.On takeoff too much back pressure was applied. Lack of recent and continual experience with the NG (Next Generation) may have contributed to this; as prior to this flight I had only flown the NG once this year; and with the last recorded entry. Further analysis of performance indicates an unintentional overweight takeoff that contributed to this event. A notation in the logbook was made for Maintenance and company was contacted regarding the event.,B737-800 flight crew reported over-rotated during takeoff resulting in tail strike.

I as relief pilot told the Captain that I would go back and assess the situation. When I arrived in the aft galley there in fact were several smoking ovens with real smoke. We immediately de-powered the galley and removed all food from the ovens. I called to Captain and told him that I was concerned that it was an issue different than spilled food because 6 of the 8 ovens were billowing smoke. There was no sign of spilled food or grease in any of the ovens. At that point the Captain advised ATC and made a turn to return to ZZZ for landing. I maintained coordination with the flight attendants and had them de-power all the galleys in the airplane including pulling the circuit breakers. I returned to the cockpit and took over all communications with Dispatch; the flight attendants; the passengers; and Crash Fire Rescue on the ground in ZZZ. On final approach into ZZZ the flight attendants called and said the ovens were smoking again. This was 15 minutes after power had been removed. I instructed them to shoot the ovens with the Halon extinguisher. They did and arrested the smoke. We landed without further incident. Taxied to the gate and replanned the passengers.,B777 First Officer reported that a faulty oven in the aft galley resulted in smoke and possible fire and resulted in a return to land.

I asked the IRO to run back and check out if the smoke was burning food trays or something else. When she called back all ovens were pouring out smoke and they were in the process of de-powering the galleys. I gave the aircraft to the First Officer and [requested priority handling]. Aircraft X turning back to ZZZ with an onboard fire. I got the IRO back up and we coordinated an [expedited return.] Dispatch was notified; ATC was helping us in; Flight Attendants were briefed; and passengers briefed. We completed over weight checklist and had Crash Fire Rescue in place for a long landing and possible bailout. I told the Flight Attendants to empty every Halon bottle in the airplane. Smoke dissipated but returned after 15 minutes. I took control of the aircraft and flew an overweight landing to Runway XX; rolled to the end; turned off and were greeted by Crash Fire Rescue. We were given a frequency for the fire crew and they checked us out as nominal. Since the smoke was dissipating we decided to get to the gate and let the fire crew on board.,B777 flight crew reported a galley fire that resulted in an air return and overweight landing.

Approximately 5 miles to the visual to Runway XXL we heard a pop and then felt a vibration throughout the aircraft. Engine indications indicated rollback on #2 engine; yaw; and roll were observed. Captain was flying; turned off the auto pilot and auto throttles and hand flew. Captain and First Officer verified #2 engine failure. First Officer immediately [advised ATC]. Captain and First Officer assessed the engine; did the immediate action items for severe engine damage; followed up with the QRC; and completed the checklists in the QRH. Tower continued; rightfully; for more information (souls; fuel; state of engine; etc.). Captain took the radios; passed the pertinent info as well as requesting fire truck support; and continued to fly the airplane. First Officer continued with the checklists. QRH severe engine damage was completed including pulling the fire handle. At step number seven we verified we still had vibrations at 230 kts. with the engine secure. We went to the one engine inoperative checklist. We completed all checklist at about 1;000 ft. AGL and cleared to land. We completed a normal engine out flaps 15 landing and roll out and cleared the runway onto the parallel taxiway. On Taxiway X; facing east; we stopped at XX where the firetrucks met us. A discrete frequency was given; and the First Officer talked with 'Red Dog' (Crash Fire Rescue); and Ground Control. Captain talked with the passengers explain the situation; to remain seated; and we would taxi back to the gate. A separate call to the Flight Attendants confirmed people were seated. Crash Fire Rescue indicated the engine looked secure and we single engine taxi back to the gate with one fire vehicle following. The only out of order steps that the Captain chose to do after [requesting priority handling] was to start the APU immediately. While the First Officer was completing the extensive checklist the Captain also turned off the flap inhibit switch; selected flaps 15 speeds in the FMC and turned the engine ignition on the good engine to CONT. The Captain decided to use Captains Authority for this checklist deviation as configuring for a single engine landing was more preferred than a complex high altitude go around with terrain at Las Vegas. The First Officer followed up with all of these items as he completed the checklists at 1;000 ft. Upon debrief with Maintenance it appeared through data link that it was #4 engine bearing seal failure and N1 seized.,B737 flight crew reported an engine failure during initial approach to landing.

On climbout; the Captain's trim switches would not work. He gave me the aircraft to see if mine worked. They did not. I engaged the autopilot; because that is another way that stabilizer trim gets an input. That didn't work either. Ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative Checklist. Requested priority handling with ATC. Manually trimmed unintended handles on trim wheel. Flaps 15. Overweight landing. Touchdown very smooth. Equipment followed us to Ramp Area. Wrote up stabilizer trim electric inoperative and overweight landing. Chief Pilot onboard and talked with us; no issues about continuing our trip. Deplaned. Got a different airplane and flew to ZZZ1. We followed all SOP. Uneventful with highly successful outcome. Trained well to handle this type of event. We had both noted that this was written up before. So; neither were surprised when it did happen again.,A321 First Officer reported both sets of stabilizer trim switches became inoperative after takeoff.

At approximately XA:45 near ZZZ1 airport and approximately 40 minutes from landing; we received the ECAM Cautions HYD G RSVR LO LVL; G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR; AND G SYS LO PR. These indications of a loss of Green Hydraulic System Quantity were confirmed by the Hydraulic page indicating no quantity in the Green system. I stated 'my aircraft' and we proceeded with the FIX (Fly Identify Execute) strategy. The FO/PM (First Officer / Pilot Flying) checked the QRC (Quick Reference Checklist) and determined it was not an Immediate Action or ECAM exception. I transferred aircraft control to the FO and accomplished the ECAM procedures. Then referenced the QRH for follow up procedures. We also received a call from a flight attendant informing us that they heard a loud noise that sounded like the hydraulic pump and then it stopped. I asked if she could see any fluid or other indications and she said she didn't. I thanked her for the information and informed her we were running a procedure and to contact me if she noticed anything further. After completing the ECAM and QRH follow-up procedures we formulated a plan. We would [request priority handling] with ATC. We were now just a few minutes from start of descent into ZZZ; and we determined a landing at ZZZ would be the safest and most appropriate point of landing. From the procedures; we knew that we would have to gravity extend the gear; the flap/slats would be slow; we would need to accomplish an abnormal landing assessment; normal braking was INOP (Inoperative) but we had alternate braking with Anti-Skid; and nose wheel steering was INOP. This would require at least a 15 mile final to accomplish the Gravity Gear Extension Procedure and to account for slow moving Flaps. Due to inoperative nose wheel steering we would not be able to taxi and a full stop on the runway with a tow in to gate would be required. We also wanted Fire Equipment standing by and wanted to be inspected upon stopping regarding the fluid leak. I instructed the FO to send a message to dispatch to communicate our emergency and plan; and to prepare for arrival/landing at ZZZ. I [requested priority landing] with ATC and communicated our problem and plan; including our intention to full stop Runway XX and require a tow in. After this; I ran the Non-Routine Landings Consideration Checklist in the QRH. I contacted the FA's and communicated our emergency and our plan for a precautionary landing and tow-in. I made a PA to do the same for the passengers. We performed a normal descent on the ZZZZZ arrival to Runway XX. At the appropriate time I gave control of the aircraft back to the FO and extended the landing gear using the QRH L/G Gravity Extension Procedure. I resumed aircraft control after the gear was down and locked and the procedure was completed. We made a normal landing. Aircraft control was noticeably more difficult than I was expecting decelerating through 80 kts. with only differential braking but we maintained centerline just fine. After coming to a stop I made the PA to remain seated and that we would be inspected by safety vehicles. The safety vehicles performed their inspection and informed us of an obvious hydraulic leak on the number one engine. After performing the after landing flows; we shut down both engines. Dispatch had already coordinated with operations for the tow in crew and they met the aircraft within a few minutes. We were towed into the gate with one of the fire vehicles following us. The FO; flight attendants; ATC; fire crews; dispatch; operations; and ground crew all did an exemplary job throughout this event.,A320 flight crew reported a leak in the green hydraulic system prior to top of descent.

I heard the Flight Attendant make a PA for medical personnel to ring their call button. A few moments later; we got a call from the Flight Attendants. The Captain answered. The Flight Attendant told him that a passenger was unconscious in the back. We began to prepare for a possible medical diversion. I pulled up the QRG Medical Guide and Diversion Planning Guide and we starting reviewing. The Flight Attendant called back a short time later and said that medical personnel on board believed the passenger was having a stroke and recommended landing. We immediately sent a message via ACARS and started discussing diversion option while trying to reach Dispatch and Medical. The Captain began pulling weather; etc. After not getting a response from Dispatch; we sent another message via ACARS and continued discussing options. I'm not sure how much time went by; but it was too long. We sent one more 'call me' via ACARS and I queried ATC to get an ARINC frequency. She was able to provide one. I called ARINC and requested our dispatch and desk number. At this point; the situation in the back with the passenger had not improved. We got Dispatch on the radio and tried to discuss what was happening and requested Medical; but we were having extreme difficulty understanding and communicating with dispatch. Given the medical situation and our inability to adequately communicate with dispatch; the Captain suggested that we go ahead and divert to ZZZ. I fully agreed with his suggestion and he implemented the command decision. We diverted and landed. We had to work around some weather and set up for the approach. Also; [we requested priority handling]. We fully prepared; briefed; ran checklists as well as referred to the diversion guide for guidance. All items were completed and we kept our speed up below 10;000 ft. as we felt the [situation] warranted expediting to the field; we informed ATC of our speed.The major concern in this incident was our inability to effectively communicate with Dispatch. We never received an answer to our 3 'call me' ACARS messages; and when we got them on the radio; we couldn't understand due to poor radio coverage. In the debrief; we discussed it and both expressed that we felt like we were somewhat on our own making the decisions. Given our resources and time constraints; we chose ZZZ as we felt it was a close 'sure bet' for providing care; as well as suitable to land; on the list of serviced airports; etc. It would have been helpful to converse with Dispatch on these decisions; and also; to speak with Medical prior to diverting; but it wasn't feasible given the Comms. Given the challenges; the Captain did an absolute superb job commanding the situation. I would say that our crew effectiveness and CRM was excellent and we worked the problem together successfully.,B737 pilot reported an inflight passenger medical emergency that resulted in an immediate diversion.

Jumpseating off-duty [pilot] was riding in the back. Departed on Runway XXL; normal operations with no indications of any engine abnormalities. Passing through 27;000 ft.; [there was a] loud bang; [the] aircraft shuddered; and yawed slowly to the left. After the bang; ENG 1 N1 rolled back - [the] trend arrow for N1 on engine indications decreased to near idle. Due to our high deck angle; being heavy; and at an altitude where we normally lose a lot of available climb thrust; there was an immediate loss of airspeed. Although FO was flying; CA (Captain) reached over and selected 20;000 ft. to start and pulled open descent to prevent any further climb and lowered the nose. We then called ATC to [request priority handling] and initiated a 180 degree turn back to the airport. ECAM actions were started for the ECAM 'ENG high engine vibrations.' ECAM directed us to apply High ENG Vibrations QRH. While in the middle of QRH; FA (Flight Attendant) had called to ask us questions. I quickly told her that we were having some engine issues; plane was under control; but I would need to call her back with a TEST since we were still taking care of the situation. ATC then gave us direct to ZZZ and descend to 10;000 ft. Descent rate was normal and did not exceed approximately 2;500 fpm.At this point; about 2-3 minutes had elapsed since the initial bang. N1 on engine #1 never got above approximately 40-50% N1... thrust seemed minimal. ENG #1 then failed and auto shut-downed for about 10 seconds; then auto-restarted as we noticed the AVAIL light appear. I resumed the high vibration QRH and were about to coordinate reducing engine #1 thrust to control the vibrations when ENG #1 failed again. FA called again and quickly told her I'd call her back. We decided to switch gears and do ECAM actions for ENG #1 Fail. We secured ENG #1 per ECAM and completed ECAM actions. Due to the loud bang and initial high vibrations; we elected to blow the fire protection squib as well. Yaw of aircraft was affected with thrust changes from engine #1 failing and restarting.Weather and numbers were pulled up to confirm that we could land safely in ZZZ on XYL and weather was still ok. I then called the FA to brief her on the situation and gave her a TEST briefing. She then informed me that there was smoke in the cabin and passengers reported fire coming from engine #1. I told her that was probably residual smoke from the engine failure but if the smoke persisted then to call me back and we would reassess the situation from there. There were no fire indications in the cockpit so I proceeded as planned. [The Jumpseater off-duty pilot] at this time had made FA's aware that he could be of help and we let him in with the door keypad. CA briefed him on the situation and asked him to call Dispatch and specifically watch our ENG #2 for any abnormalities. Made a PA to passengers sometime during this time advising them we had an engine failure; aircraft was flying fine and that we would be returning to ZZZ in 25 minutes.We needed more time to finish last QRH's for overweight landing and SE (Single Engine) straight in approach. I requested a PPOS (Present Position) hold for 5 minutes. We then continued and finished the overweight landing QRH and single-engine straight in approach QRH's. We then held in the vicinity of ZZZ and expressed to crew that if there was anything that happened to our #2 Engine that we had ZZZ1 MCAS at our disposal. At this point; Engine #2 displayed no abnormal indications. CA set up the approach; briefed approach; then switched controls so CA was now PF (Pilot Flying) for remainder of flight. Approach checklist was completed and we advised ATC we were ready for the approach as well as confirming that ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) would be standing by for us. CA also checked in with FA's to see if smoke was still an issue since crew didn't smell anything. They confirmed that the cabin was clear and everyone was ready for approach. I also made one last PA to passengers advising them our ETA and that fire trucks will be assessing us on the runway.Turned on APU Bleed to power packs as per overweight landing checklist. LDA XYL approach in to a normal landing. Full stop; made a PA for passengers to remain seated. We had requested a discrete code for ARFF but it was not working on ground so we just talked to firemen on Tower. Firetrucks looked us over with particular attention to engine; gear; tires and cabin damage. Firemen gave us the ok and we elected to remain emergency aircraft and taxi back to gate with trucks following us in the case of any other issues. We also elected to leave flaps down in full position as I wasn't certain if there was any damage to flap fairings or flap area. Taxied to the gate; canceled emergency with ARFF reaching alley; pulled into Gate XX; and shutdown secured aircraft per SOP.,A321 flight crew reported experiencing a compressor stall and subsequent failure of the #1 engine resulting in a return to the departure airport.

An hour into the flight; we were cruising at FL380. We received a call from the Number 1 Flight Attendant letting us know that there was an odor in the back of the aircraft that smelled like burning wire. He said he could smell it from about 3 rows from the aft galley. No smoke was seen. The Captain asked about the 2 flight attendants in the back. The Number 1 stated they felt a little nausea and headache; but they were doing okay. At that point; the Captain elected to [advise ATC] and land at ZZZ1. We were about 40nm from ZZZ1. I continued flying while the Captain coordinated with ATC; the Company; and the flight attendants. Captain also made a PA to the passengers. We were given radar vectors to land on RWY XXC. We landed uneventful on [Runway] XXC and stopped on the runway. We talked with ARFF and had them check the aircraft for smoke and anything out of the ordinary. ARFF said they saw nothing and we continued to the gate with ARFF following us. Once parked at the gate; the passengers deplaned. The two flight attendants in the back deplaned and were met by the EMTs and checked out. Maintenance boarded and checked the aircraft for possible sources of the smell. In the end; they said it was a power port that was overheating.  Throughout the event; there was no change reported in the strength of the odor.,B737-800 First Officer reported Flight Attendant notification of 'burning wire' fumes in the passenger cabin. Captain executed an uneventful diversion after flight attendants in aft galley reported physiological symptoms.

Normal taxi-out and departure from runway. Climbed to FL330 in smooth air and first 45 minutes of flight unremarkable. FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying) and Captain PM (Pilot Monitoring). Engine 1 experienced a stall accompanied by partial EPR rollback on ENG 1 and an ECAM 'ENG 1 STALL.' FO retained control of flying and took radios and Captain began ECAM and QRH. Engine recovered itself with no action required and remained stable with no further indications of a stall.Crew resumed normal PF/PM duties and we reviewed the ENG 1 STALL QRH to ensure all considerations taken. We discussed monitoring engine and reviewed the driftdown QRC items to be prepared should another event occur. FO reviewed our single engine performance capability to confirm capability at present weight. Captain shared event information with [Company] Maintenance via ACARS and notified Dispatch. All parties believed it was a momentary event and engine was operating normally.A second; deeper Engine 1 Stall occurred about 35 minutes later and again FO remained the PF and took communications so Captain could run the ECAM and QRH. Per the procedure when thrust was slowly brought back up on Engine 1 further vibrations and stalls began and thrust lever was returned to idle where engine idled with normal indications. We coordinated a driftdown with ATC while we completed our analysis of the engine status and advised ATC working a degraded engine situation. Dispatch was also advised; and closest airports were reviewed with consideration to single engine performance ability as well as overweight landing performance for a weight of 150;000 pounds.Captain decided safest plan was to land in ZZZ; [Requested Priority Handling] with ATC and advised Flight Attendants of plan. Dispatch was advised of diversion to ZZZ with degraded engine. A brief passenger announcement was also made. Flight attendants advised Captain passenger was not feeling well and oxygen was being administered. A medically trained passenger was assisting crew with the ill passenger. A pass-rider Flight Attendant also stepped up to assist cabin crew for balance of flight.We prepared and briefed a descent to ZZZ and requested Runway XXL. Performance data received from Dispatch and Captain elected to fly the descent and approach. FO provided excellent PM and callouts. An uneventful landing on ZZZ XXL completed with [airport rescue and firefighting] equipment positioned on the adjacent taxiway. Aircraft was able to safely taxi to gate with a fire truck escort.Maintenance release codes were sent for ENG 1 STALL ECAMs and a used oxygen bottle. A phone call to [Technical Support Maintenance Control] was made by Captain as well to log the overweight landing and describe events. Captain and FO debriefed in ZZZ to review CRM elements and outcome. Crew deadheaded back to ZZZ1 later in the afternoon.,A320 flight crew reported a divert due to compressor stalls on left then right engine.

We were given safety instructions; including the brace position; which we need to hold during landing. Before takeoff; we were told that there were computer and HVAC problems. There were clearly electrical wiring problems and I would like to know if there has been an investigation on this plane; and what is the outcome of the report.,Passenger on flight reported 'burning fumes' resulting in a diversion.

It was immediately followed by a loud impact noise. The smell of an animal through an engine entered the aircraft. Additionally a change in air noise happened. Almost like a panel was open. A check of the engines indicated that they were both operating normally; and I also checked the pressurization which was also normal. The FO and I quickly agreed that we should level off; which ATC granted. We told them we had hit a bird and would probably be returning to ZZZ1 or maybe ZZZ. At that time the FA (Flight Attendants) called about the smell and that we had hit something on the number two engine. They indicated that there was a hole or dent in the thing that goes around the engine. I asked if everyone was alright and they said 'yes'. I told them I would get back to them with more information. When I returned; the FO indicated that ATC had requested priority handling for us. We then agreed to stay in the area while we got a plan in order. We believed (based on our aircraft being approximately 8000 lbs over max landing weight; and the possibility that there could be some issues with the leading edge devices); we decided ZZZ was where we wanted to go to. I called ZZZ1 Operations and had them have Dispatch call us on frequency. Once on with us; we told him our plan and he agreed and said he would get things coordinated at ZZZ. With the FO flying; I ran the Diversion Checklist; and also got landing information for ZZZ. ATC planned for us to land on Runway XXR. We briefed the approach and talked about it again to make sure we had done everything; and were not missing anything. I also read the overweight landing information from the AOM out loud. When all checklists and notifications were complete (and on the approach) we transferred controls so that I could land the aircraft. After landing; we cleared the runway; shut down the number 2 engine; and had airport rescue inspect the aircraft for any smoke or liquids coming from the aircraft. They said all was normal. We the completed the performance [calculation for] brake cooling and found that no special restrictions were needed and we could cool at the gate. We taxied to the gate and deplaned all the Passengers into the terminal.,B737-700 flight crew reported a diversion and landing after a bird strike to the right engine.

We could [smell] some of it in the cockpit also. I immediately notified ATC and requested priority handling and CFR equipment standing by. ATC immediately gave me direct ZZZ. I let the First Officer continue flying while I ran the emergency checklist for fumes and continued contact with the cabin. A strong smell continued all the way until landing. I conferred with the First Officer and flight attendants and they felt there was no reason to evacuate at that point and I agreed. However; I requested the firetrucks to follow us all the way to the gate just in case.,B737-400 Captain reported cabin fumes during cruise and requested priority handling at destination airport.

During climbout; passing approximately 4;000 feet; the Number 2 engine power reduced to approximately 35% N1. Tried closing and advancing the Number 2 power lever with no effect. Advised ATC and requested priority handling. Turning right to the west; realized that we were in a good position for an almost straight in approach to Runway XYR. Wind was light and almost a direct crosswind to the parallel runways at ZZZ; so I requested landing on XYR. No unusual engine indications were noted other than the lack of thrust. Left the engine running to maintain electrical and hydraulic systems. Landed normally with 15 degrees of flaps.CRFF (Crash Rescue Fire Fighting) inspection showed no leaks or other problems so we taxied to the gate. The landing was made at less than the max landing weight. On the ground; the engine idle remained at 30% N1. Probably could have slowed down and more thoroughly run the checklists but position and conditions were conducive to an immediate landing. Other than the lack of thrust the aircraft operated normally.,B737 flight crew reported the engine rollbacked to approximately 35% N1 during the initial climb; resulting in an immediate return to the departure airport.

I proceeded to call the cabin to inquire if they could smell the odor that we were experiencing. The number one flight attendant informed me that she could smell it and passengers were complaining about the odor as well. It was a very strong odor that I have never experienced before. It had a chemical smell to it and we could not determine the origin. I proceeded to identify as a priority handling with departure and we returned for landing. The total time in flight was 10 minutes and the landing was uneventful. After being checked by the ARFF crew we proceeded to the gate. An entry was made in the logbook and maintenance was notified. It is also important to note that two days prior; this aircraft had to return to the gate due to an odor on the aircraft and according to ZZZ maintenance the aircraft had another logbook indicating an odor in the cabin. There were no health issued with the passengers; and the flight attendants declined to be checked in ZZZ.,B737-800 flight crew reported strong fumes on flight deck during takeoff; consequently; they returned to the departure airport.

It looked inoperative but with the side light it was hard to tell. So I looked at the right side to compare what it should look like and confirmed that the left side was out. So at that point I continued on with my walk around. Once I got back up to the flight deck I informed the Captain of the inoperative landing light where he then completed the MEL with Maintenance Control. After pushback and engine start; it was noticed that the Captain's pitot heat light was illuminated. I continued with my After Start Flow and then we did the Before Taxi Checklist. Once that was completed we ran the QRH for the Captain Pitot light and determined it needed to be MELed. Once the paperwork was completed we continued to the runway.During the takeoff roll; where I was the Pilot Flying; the Captain called for the reject around 70 kts. We cleared the runway and ran brake cooling and determined it was safe to proceed back to the gate. Once at the gate the Captain asked me to do a quick walk around of the aircraft. As soon as I got down to the aircraft I noticed that the Captain-side pitot tube was missing from the aircraft. I was not part of the conversation that determined when the pitot tube may have departed the aircraft; but was informed that I must have missed that it was missing during my walk around. Shortly after that I recalled that after looking at the lights I must have never went back to the Captain side of the nose to start the preflight from my normal starting point. This event was a great reminder that when doing [an] important task; once you get distracted you should always start from the beginning and start the task over again so important items aren't missed.,B737-700 flight crew reported a rejected takeoff due to a lack of airspeed indication on the Captain's side.

As Pilot Monitoring; I immediately pointed the warning to the Pilot Flying and reached for QRH. While I began the appropriate QRH procedure the Pilot Flying continued the approach. At this point I believed this was safest course of action as we were already in the valley between the mountains. I told the Pilot Monitoring there was no way to complete the procedure during the approach and we agreed to go missed. Because of our flap issue we could not perform the full missed approach procedure; flaps were locked less than 1. Once established outbound to the hold I continued the QRH. The Leading Edge transit lead me to several other procedures. We were able to extend the Leading Edge devices; but trailing edge flaps were locked and asymmetrical. Left flap at 1/4 and right flap about 1. We both agreed in the asymmetry. We ran the final QRH checklist (trailing edge flap up) because the left and right flaps indicated less than 1; test the flight attendants; [advised ATC] and performed approach to landing with the Leading Edge devices extended and the trailing edge devices indicating less than 1 degree. The landing was in the touchdown zone and on centerline. We exited at Taxiway Delta and requested airport fire rescue examine the brakes and landing gear. The scene commander determined due to our brake temperature we could not park at the gate. We were escorted to a remote stand. Fans were placed around the main gear and once the brakes reached a safe temp passengers were deplaned via air stairs and bussed to the main terminal. We completed our post flight duties; contacted Maintenance; Dispatch and the Chief Pilot. A transmitter breaker popped was determined to have been the cause of the malfunction.Lastly our decision to land in ZZZ was influenced by several factors. Limited options in the area; ZZZ1; ZZZ2 or ZZZ3 and weather. While ZZZ has its challenges due to terrain and optical illusions I believe it was the best runway given our situation. My first choice would have been ZZZ2; but we were down to 7;000 lbs. of fuel and with the leading edge devices deployed; I feel we would have burned too much fuel en-route and would have painted ourselves into a corner in ZZZ2. ZZZ1 runway is to rough for the high Vref and ZZZ3 had weather in the area.,A Boeing 737 pilot reported a trailing edge flap malfunction which resulted in the flaps being locked out in a slightly asymmetrical position.

We accomplished the ECAM procedure and consulted the QRH; which stated that the normal brakes were inoperative also. I chose to go around because of the short runway and immediately asked for a diversion to ZZZ; which was our designated alternate. Passing through 2;000 feet; a Flight Attendant notified us that a passenger was having a seizure. We notified Dispatch and coordinated with ATC and ZZZ1 Operations; requesting paramedics to meet us at the gate. Things were very hectic during the 10 minute flight; but the First Officer and I worked well together.,A320 Captain reported that a brake system failure and a passenger medical emergency resulted in a diversion.

The item was noted to be tested and reset. On climbout from ZZZZ; the right tank quantity and totalizer once again blanked. The crossing of the Atlantic was normal; with the fuel burn and quantity tracked on the FMC. Approximately 1:30 from landing; the right tank quantity and totalizer came back but showed a fuel imbalance of more than 4;000 lbs. between the left and right tanks. The fuel configuration EICAS message was displayed and the two First Officers ran the appropriate checklist as I; (the Captain); was on my scheduled rest break. I returned to the cockpit and the First Officers informed me of the situation and what they had done with respect to the checklist. We discussed the fuel situation and we determined that we really didn't know our exact fuel quantity and location with the conflicting information from the totalizer and FMC generated fuel. A Satcom call to Dispatch and Maintenance was initiated and it was determined that the best course of action was to [advise ATC] for unknown fuel quantity and receive priority handling to expedite our landing in ZZZ1; as we were only about 90 miles from ZZZ1. An uneventful landing was made in ZZZ1 and the aircraft was taxied to the gate.,B767 Captain reported that a failure of the fuel quantity indication system resulted in an expedited landing.

While I did notice it; it was not particularly concerning to me as I was aware the engine had work done recently and the packs had been off as the aircraft was in MX all night prior to us accepting it. Climbing out of ZZZ prior to flap retraction we received an inter phone call from the rear FA XX_11 XX_16 stating that there was a fire and the cabin had a burning smell that was worsening and there was a little smoke or haziness. My FO (First Officer) confirmed the FA (Flight Attendant) said there was a fire and I immediately let ATC know that we would need to return to ZZZ ASAP. I did not specifically declare an emergency; but I did exercise my emergency authority. We were immediately given vectors for a downwind for 26. We continued to clean up the aircraft and I transferred control and ATC to the FO and I called the cabin again. I questioned the FA further who then indicated that there was no fire; nothing was hot; but there was an extremely strong odor with a burning like smell. With the urgency slightly reduced; I elected to call MX (Maintenance) and ask if the work they did may have created the odor and if it should clear up. MX indicated the work accomplished should not have created the odor; but that if it cleared up; we would probably be okay as long as we confirmed there was no fire. I again called the cabin and was told the smell was dissipating slightly but was still quite strong. I elected to return to ZZZ. We were vectored for a visual/ILS to Rwy XY and landed uneventfully underweight and taxied to the gate. AARF (Airport Rescue Firefighting) followed us to the gate and met the aircraft. After all pax (passengers) deplaned; AARF went to the aft cabin and confirmed no fire or heat but they did smell the odor. No passengers showed any ill medical effects and all deplaned normally. Nice job by the entire crew!,B737 flight crew reported Flight Attendant notification of burning odor; smoke and possible fire in the passenger cabin shortly after takeoff. Flight crew executed an air return.

My copilot and I have done this several times in the last 30 days while not together but both very experienced with the procedures and the airport. We followed the procedures to the letter and fully briefed the take-off. After being cleared for take-off and lining up with the runway I advanced the throttles to 40%. After they were established at 40%; I hit TOGA. Just as the aircraft started rolling it suddenly surged to the right and at the same time the co-pilot called out the #2 engine not accelerating. By then the #1 was at full 27K 103.1 N1. I was able to retard both engines and was able to keep the aircraft on the runway. We taxied back to the gate and called for Maintenance to come out and inspect the tires and write up the #2 engine slow to accelerate after 40% power setting. The inspection showed no damage or wear on the tires and no faults on EEC or any other systems.We talked with TECH in ZZZ and they said that this has occurred several times on the 737 and was usually the cause of having one engine that is new and the other engine having a lot of time on it. The older engine is 'looser' and may not accelerate like a new engine but when 2 older engines are matched up they accelerate at the same rate so you don't notice the acceleration rate. He said that was the case with our aircraft. Our #1 engine was just installed 2 months ago. Our #2 engine was the original engine installed NEW recently. The #1 engine has 253 cycles; the #2 engine has 12;588 cycles and is 10 years old compared to a brand new aircraft. I was told by the Technician that they just watched a video on this subject and in the video it recommends after the power is set to 40% to leave it there for 20 seconds prior to hitting TOGA. I told him that is not something we were told about or trained to do.I believe that as our aircraft are getting older and engines are getting changed with high cycles; we should be tracking this combination and have a procedure in effect such as the 20 seconds at 40% N1 prior to TOGA especially when high N1 is required such as 27K BUMP; to avoid what could have been a more serious outcome had this crew not acted so quickly and communicated so quickly regarding the #2 engine not accelerating after TOGA.,B737 Captain reported a rejected takeoff after #2 engine would not accelerate to match #1 engine.

Uneventful pushback; engine start; taxi and takeoff from XXR at ZZZ. On initial climb-out; I smelled a very faint odor in the flight deck. It smelled sweet; and I didn't think much of it at the time because I've smelled plenty of strange odors before and just assumed it was something galley or lav-related. As we continued the climb; the smell became a little bit stronger. It smelled almost exactly like Play-Doh. I asked my (First Officer) if he could smell something and he said no. To see if I was just imagining things; I put on my oxygen mask with 100% oxygen flow selected; and breathed with it for approximately 5 minutes. I no longer smelled the odor. Upon removing my mask; I immediately smelled the odor again. A few minutes later; we reached our cruise altitude of FL350. We completed our cruise duties. I could still smell the odor; and within a few more minutes; my eyes began to feel slightly irritated. The (First Officer/PF) reported that he could smell a faint odor; but reported no physiological effects from its exposure. To get a third opinion; we called the cabin and asked if the Flight Attendants could set up a barrier and if our #1 could come up front to see if he smelled something strange. Upon entering the flight deck; our #1 immediately reported a strong 'sweet' smell and a feeling of 'heaviness' in the air that was not present anywhere in the cabin. After leaving the flight deck; he walked to the aft galley and back to the forward galley and confirmed that the smell was only present in the flight deck. By this time; the 'Play-Doh' odor was a bit stronger; the (First Officer) began coughing; and we agreed that we were experiencing a fume event. We both donned our oxygen masks with 100% flow selected. We [notified ATC] with Center and told them we would be diverting to ZZZ2; which was almost immediately due south of us and within 60 miles. They cleared us to ZZZ2 via direct and we began our descent. The (First Officer) flew the aircraft and took the radios while I ran the QRC for fumes in the flight deck; which directed me to the QRH (chapter) to continue the procedure. I was extremely task-saturated nearly the entire remainder of the flight because the (First Officer) did not have any free hands to do anything but fly the aircraft (he was descending with full speed brakes and coordinating with ATC); so I also programmed ZZZ2 into the box as our new destination; got the ATIS; set landing field elevation; and then built the approach for Runway X. I set the inbound course and frequency for both me (Captain PM) and the (First Officer PF). He handed me his iPad so I could pull up the approach plate for him. I did so; and also gave him a quick briefing on the pertinent items for the approach. I ran the Descent and Before Landing Checklists. While completing these tasks; I was also running QRH for fumes in the flight deck. Step [XX] of the QRH procedure (as well as common sense) directed us to not delay landing in an attempt to complete all of the checklist items; so we prioritized landing at ZZZ2 ASAP over completing the entire checklist. Our masks began to fog up; so we switched to Forced Flow 100% (they cleared up quickly). I called the Flight Attendants as instructed by the QRH procedure to notify them that cabin lighting would be extinguished; but that passengers would have reading lights available. Communication was challenging; as the masks allowed us to talk to only one person at a time (i.e.; if I wanted to talk to the FAs; I couldn't communicate with the (First Officer; PF) while doing so because the mask muffled my voice); which made proper CRM absolutely crucial so that nobody was left out of the loop. The irritation in my eyes was no longer an issue (it only happened when I had my mask off) but my First Officer reported chest pains and painful breathing; even with the mask on. I asked if he felt okay to land the aircraft; and he said he was; but I stayed alert and ready to assume control should he become incapacitated. As we would be landing 6;000 pounds overweight; I also ran the QRH procedure for an overweight landing. ZZZ2 approach vectored us for a visual approach and landing on Runway X; which was conducted without incident. The timespan from initiating the diversion at FL350 to touchdown at ZZZ2 was 20 minutes. My (First Officer) touched down smoothly in the touchdown zone and on centerline. We exited right and stopped the aircraft to ensure the situation was under control and that we were safe to taxi to the gate. After agreeing that we could taxi in without further incident; we notified ATC that it was safe to release the emergency vehicles; and taxied to the gate & deplaned the passengers. None of the passengers or Flight Attendants reported any adverse physiological effects from the fume event; although our #1 said that after landing; they could also smell the odor in the cabin as the aircraft depressurized and the fumes were sucked aft to the outflow valve. After contacting the company; Maintenance and Dispatch; we were sent to a hotel; and from there the (First Officer) and I immediately went to the ER; where we were treated for our respective symptoms we reported during the fume event. After 4 hours of observation; we were deemed to be medically OK and released from the ER.,B737-800 flight crew reported a fume event in the cockpit which resulted in a diversion.

There was a line of weather to our east and south and we were IMC and started getting turbulence. It was enough that we had some power fluctuations. Within a minute I smelled the smell; hot; sour; musty odor. My eyes and throat felt dry and burned. Within a minute of that; we got a call from the cabin that they were smelling the fumes also. I told them I would call them back as soon as we addressed the issue. Because we were still in radar contact; I told First Officer (FO) to get the checklist up and I sent a message to Dispatch to let them know before we got to class II. My thought was they would turn us around or send us to ZZZ or ZZZ1; but they wanted us to continue. We ran the isolation checklist; but the smell was dissipating so we were never able to isolate it. All the while were in turbulence and deviating. Over the next 2 hours we had 10 or more fumes events where it was a burst of smell then dissipation. 4 of the events led to FO and I putting on our oxygen masks. Right before reentering ZZZ2 airspace; we got a message from Dispatch that they were considering sending us to ZZZ1. We felt that was the best and safest course of action; but then they said they wanted us to press on. Because we didn't feel incapacitated and there was no guidance to divert. We felt pressured to continue on to ZZZZ knowing that wasn't a decision made with safety as a priority. We continued to ZZZZ; our conscience bothering us; and had a couple more fumes events. The last being when we transferred the bleeds from the engines to the APU. Upon reaching ZZZZ; we contacted Medlink and relayed our symptoms. Symptoms of exposure were: headaches; burning eyes and throats; nausea; light headedness; and numbness in extremities. I was told by Medlink that my symptoms warranted medical attention and that mine weren't even the worst symptoms. Every person on my crew should call them. I was not comfortable with going to an emergency room in ZZZZ so I agreed to do subsequent phone evals with medlink and get back to anywhere in the US for evaluation. In the end; medlink released me; but recommended seeing my doctor at my earliest convenience. I was alarmed at the onset and severity of the symptoms. They did seem to ease fairly quickly after getting fresh air and more water; but never completely went away. Another concern outside of all of this was inflight leadership response. The conditions that two of them were suffering were far more severe than mine. But they were actually afraid to call medlink or get checked out because they spoke to two inflight supervisors. One of those two supervisors told our inflight: 'under no circumstance are you to contact medlink.' and 'you are only allowed to contact medlink if you are incapacitated.' In the end they contacted medlink after receiving guidance outside [company] inflight leadership that they should follow FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) guidance and 'take personal health seriously.' My biggest concerns are the reoccurring fumes events and the downplay by the company. Being pressured to continue the mission despite safety. Finally; feel of repercussions for taking one's own health into consideration.,A320 Captain reported an intermittent fume event resulting in physiological symptoms by entire crew. Reporter stated he felt pressured to continue to the destination in spite of cabin crew symptoms being more severe than flight crew. Entire crew received medical evaluation after flight.

I reviewed the MELs in OPS. Per 28-XX knew to look for a fueling slip and a form XXXXX; though I was not familiar with that form. Once at the aircraft during preflight we did receive both forms from different fuelers. Release was 14;612; fuel slip showed a total of 14;800 lbs. At the gate the #1 tank showed 7.40; the center 0.00; the #2 tank was blank; and the totalizer was blank. Spending some time attempting to understand the form XXXXX; I discerned it was our aircraft and date; and the stuck tank measured to an equivalent volume of 7400 lbs. So it looked we had a balanced load of empty center and 7400 lbs in each wing tank. I filled in 14.8 in the fuel block on the INIT REF page; as that block was blank.During pushback and engine start the ground crew reported a fuel leak from the #2 engine. I had him stay connected during the five minute warm up period. By the end of the 5 minutes the leak stopped. Taxi; takeoff; climb; and cruise were normal. ATC gave us 2 shortcuts; one direct ZZZZZ after ZZZZZ1; then later direct ZZZZZ2. Fuel check at ZZZZZ was right on. I subsequently did the MEL recommended fuel check using fuel used. That showed 2.7 used by each engine (5.4 total). Deducted from the starting fuel of 14.8 gave us 9.4. Just after that we passed abeam ZZZZZ3; where I recorded 9.2; compared to the MISC 14 prediction of 9.5.Shortly thereafter the #2 tank FWD pump LOW PRESSURE light began to flash. I pointed this out to the FO (First Officer) and commented something like 'well that's not right!' then 'well now why would that be happening?' Subsequently that light came on steady; followed by the AFT LOW PRESSURE light beginning to flash. I told the FO we had a big problem and that we needed to consider that the only fuel we might have available was the #1 tank fuel; as I pointed to the left quantity. We agreed; and at that point the #2 AFT LP light came on steady; both MC lights came on; and the #2 engine began rolling back.At this point it appeared we had a right engine failure. We ensured the FO had the aircraft; he clicked off the automation and managed the yaw and loss of thrust. I reached up and opened the fuel crossfeed. Our estimate was that N1 decreased to about 20-30 %. After a very mild audible and tactile vibration; the right engine began to recover; increasing N1 and N2 and returning to normal thrust and indications. The FO and I agreed on the diversion to ZZZ which was ahead at 11:30 clock code and by then about 100 miles ahead. I [spoke with] ATC and told them we were diverting to ZZZ. I had been to ZZZ before and knew the station had [company] maintenance. I asked for a series of right 360s to descend. ATC said they had traffic over there; asked if we could take a left vector heading to absorb the altitude loss and I said yes. The FO continued to manage energy while flying the aircraft. From there it was the normal ACARS MISC [message]; backing up the FO as he deftly flew the aircraft and got us down expeditiously; running regular checklists; completing non-routine landing consideration tasks; talking to the #1 FA (Flight Attendant); making PAs; etc. The FO flew a flawless visual approach and spectacular touchdown; backed up by the ILS; to RW XXL.After landing on RW 1XXL and clearing the Runway I asked the ARFF commander if he saw any fuel leaking from the right wing or engine and he said no. Proceeded to gate XX. On the gate the indicating fuel gauges showed 3.52 in the #1 tank; 0.00 in the center tank. No other fuel light had ever annunciated (e.g. 'LOW' or 'IMBAL'). Maintenance was on the jet bridge; boarded on our arrival and we began the conversation; relating the details of what we saw over time. We agreed with their plan to stick the right wing; look for fuel leaks; talk to [Maintenance Control]; and eventually refuel to a known quantity and stick again. The fueler reported the #2 wing tank was 'bone dry'. We discussedpossible causes of our symptoms: a fuel leak; bad fuel; fuel sticking inconsistencies. They began their work; saying eventually they would be doing an engine start and run to look for leaks; all of which would take some time.In speaking with dispatch to determine a rough fuel load that maintenance could use in their work; [I was asked] to speak to a maintenance manager who was there. The manager asked for a recap; what lights we had; what paperwork we had received in ZZZ1; what RPM the #2 had spooled down to; and asked if we could send him copies of the fuel slip and form XXXXX. I later had the FO do that. ZZZ maintenance continued to work with us. They reported there was no placard out on the refueling panel for the 28-XXa.I made periodic PAs to the passengers. The #1 FA indicated there were some passengers that wanted to deplane. I went up to the gate to retrieve an agent. We discussed the options and mutually decided to deplane everyone. Back on the aircraft calls with dispatch resulted in us learning the aircraft was taken OTS. 3 AML entries were made reporting the fuel tank LOW PRESSURE lights and subsequent rollback with empty #2 tank upon arrival at gate; the engine rollback; and the pulled CVR CB.We began to get texts from ZZZ1 Chief Pilots supporting us and offering assistance.,B737 flight crew was dispatched with several MELs regarding fuel system. During flight crew received several fuel warning lights and the right engine rolled back. Crew diverted; landed safely; and learned their right wing fuel tank was empty.

Complied with ECAM. Requested lower altitude and priority handling. Determined based on our position and drift down QRH chart that we would be above terrain. We also verified this by leveling at FL190 and selection 280 kts. We then referenced the QRH; briefed the flight attendants; and proceeded directly to ZZZ. We requested XXL and emergency equipment. Captain performed the landing. Upon exiting the runway at XY the crew noticed brake temps in excess of 500c. We then requested to continue north as ATC instruction were south on Z. This was to avoid more braking and downhill taxi. We then came to a slow rolling stop with minimal breaking on taxiway AX short of XXR. At that point left side brakes were around 800c and right side 700c. Crew used right brake only in an attempt to get the left cooling as soon as possible. Briefed the FA and passengers that it would be a little while before we could continue and started coordinating with operations and maintenance.,A321 flight crew reported an ECAM indication of a thrust reverser being pressurized.

I reply that we are searching; but internal to cockpit we note the TCAS contact that meets the fallout. PF (Pilot Flying) is flying without any autopilot systems for proficiency; but is stable at 6;000 feet. TCAS TA approx 5 miles and -05 becomes -03 while we are level; suggesting a slight climb by the conflict aircraft. ATC still seeks threat and vectors us 10 degrees to the left. Shortly after the turn we receive a TCAS RA and inform ATC we are climbing in accordance with the RA. Shortly after the maneuver is initiated; we identified what appears to be a twin engine VFR aircraft from left to right on the windscreen but below our altitude and approximately 3-5 miles away. It was unclear if the VFR aircraft maneuvered in response to an RA. We advised ATC that the RA had cleared and returned to our assigned altitude; ATC acknowledged and remainder of flight was without incident.,B737 flight crew had a Traffic Alert during approach to land.

I was the Pilot Flying and the First Officer was the Pilot Monitoring. Approximately 1:30 minutes into the flight; I detected a faint odor that initially I thought might be from the air system. I mentioned this to the First Officer and then noticed smoke coming from the trip counter on my control wheel. The First Officer saw it too and we immediately put on our oxygen masks and smoke goggles and followed the QRC procedure of establishing communications. We followed the QRC which led us to the QRH. We followed the checklist for smoke; fire; fumes; and I also turned the MAIN PANEL brightness rheostat to off. At that point; the smoke had dissipated and no more smoke was emanating from the trip ID counter.We were able to determine the source; and since the smoke was no longer present; we elected to remove our oxygen masks and smoke goggles to more easily communicate and coordinate our divert. Given our location; we determined which airport was our best place to divert to. We advised with Center and were cleared direct to the airport. We were approximately 150 miles from the airport at that point. We notified Dispatch of the situation; and the First Officer informed the flight attendants of the situation. We told them to secure the cabin and also informed the passengers of the situation and our diverting to ZZZ. The landing was uneventful and no additional smoke was ever noticed. We taxied to the gate and the passengers deplaned normally. One thing a lot of us are guilty of is tapping the trip counter if the backlight is not working. This could unknowingly damage the wiring inside and cause a short which is possibly the cause of the smoke we experienced.,B737-700 flight crew reported advising ATC and diverting due to smoke in the cockpit during cruise.

Rain showers were present at the field. Aircraft was in position at gate with passenger ramp in-place. Crew Entry Door open. Significant standing water was present in forward galley and on cockpit floor. Water was thoroughly removed. Passing about 10;300 ft; the FO (First Officer); PF (Pilot Flying); attempted to turn on the Weather RADAR for thunderstorms en route. WXR FAIL appeared on both NDs. Attempted AUTO; MAN and MAP modes with System Control in NORM and TEST on both sides with no change. Circuit breakers were normal. Requested and received weather avoidance vectors from HCF Departure and Center. We experienced a simultaneous failure of SATCOM2. Call light 'C' was illuminated and could not be extinguished.An attempt to call Dispatch on SATCOM 2 failed. Contacted Dispatch through SATCOM 1 for external resources. Coordinated with Dispatch; Maintenance Control and Center to return to ZZZ. Referenced Diversion Information. Planned an overweight landing. On initial descent; 'B' FA called with 2 rings to report an unknown; burning odor in the aft cabin. Agreed to further access and report. 'B' and 'D' FAs called back approximately TWO minutes later; confirmed the odor; but no signs of abnormal heat; smoke or flame. We transferred aircraft control: Captain-PF; FO-PM (Pilot Monitoring); requested priority handling and ran QRC/QRH; 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes.' Conducted a visual approach to Runway XR. Stopped on the runway and got an external assessment from Airport Rescue and Firefighting. FAs reported odor had dissipated.,B737-800 Captain reported uneventful air return due to multiple avionics component failures accompanied by 'burning odor.'

While on descent into ZZZ through approximately 18;000 feet we noticed an odor once we entered visible moisture. The odor persisted while on descent but once we were out of the visible moisture; the odor lessened.   Upon arrival to the gate and after engine shutdown; one of the aft Flight Attendants called to report that the odor was very strong in the aft of the aircraft.   A logbook entry was made and Maintenance was called. I also spoke with the [Duty Manager] and made a report to him regarding the cabin odor.   After the aircraft was deplaned; the flight attendants and I felt some symptoms and we spoke with Medlink. After conferring with Medlink; we decided to go to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. During cruise; we had a Lavatory Smoke warning which only lasted a few seconds. The flight attendants performed an inspection of all three lavatories and found no evidence of smoke or fumes in any of the lavatories.,A320 flight crew reported a fume event during arrival descent. Entire flight crew received medical evaluation and treatment at local hospital.

I felt it was either a UTI; or bladder infection. Onset was rapid; and decline was rapid. I realized the safest course of action was to have the FO's (First Officer) make the landing. The FO's contacted ATC and Dispatch and [requested priority handling]. Sudden onset of illness; resulting in high fever. Hydrate more. Three 3-day trips in a row with one day off between each. Most certainly I have been running dehydrated.,B777 flight crew reported the Captain's sudden onset of illness during flight resulted in the First Officer and Relief Pilot assuming flying duties that led to an uneventful landing.

Report filed by pilots. Confirmation of submission. Mechanic briefed. Mechanic informed me flight attendants reported to him the dirty sock odor was evident after gear retraction in ZZZ. I asked the mechanic for the AML back to update my write up. He refused stating he would advise the Maintenance Manager. He did not as evidenced by the narrative on [reporting website]. I followed up with the [point of contact] in Maintenance Control. He said he would accurately update my briefing in the comments section. He requested I refile my report and I did. He confirmed receipt. The On Duty pilot called to check on crew. ZZZ1 Director called me to check on crew also. ZZZ line mechanic inaccuracies in report narrative is an injustice to all parties involved and a negative aspect to safety in so far as correcting issues.,A330 flight crew reported a fume event during descent; advised ATC; and emergency vehicles followed the aircraft to the gate. Captain also experienced a communication issue with the mechanic regarding the logbook write up.

When I pulled my O2 mask out of the compartment; the hose blew off. I was able to reattach it; but while the First Officer was in the lavatory; the hose blew off again and this time; the retaining ferrule blew off and I was unable to find it. I wasn't able to reattach the hose and the oxygen was flowing out at full pressure. I turned off the crew supply and arranged a phone patch to maintenance operations. Upon conferring with maintenance; we agreed that we could not continue. We [advised ATC] and returned to our departure point where an overweight landing was made. If I had to guess; I'd say some pilots probably remove the mask incorrectly by pulling on the hose; rather than using the red release tabs. Whatever the cause; the hose was loose enough that when I went to put the mask on; the oxygen pressure blew the hose off its connection to the mask.,A321 Captain reported that an oxygen mask malfunction resulted in a diversion.

Upon taxi; I noticed an acrid/dirty socks/musty smell when I added power. As I backed off the power on taxi; the smell seemed to dissipate. On power up taking the Runway (XXL); the smell returned. I made the decision to continue the takeoff and said to the First Officer that if this doesn't dissipate and go away we should return and he agreed. Once airborne; it got even worse and became a significant fume event. We donned O2 masks and goggles; I [advised ATC] due to fumes in the cockpit and we returned to land on [Runway] XXL. The First Officer flew and landed. I talked to ATC and ran the Fumes/Odor/Smoke Checklist. We landed uneventfully 2;000 lbs overweight.  Holding short of the runway; I called back to the Purser and asked him if he smelled anything. He said he didn't but would check in the back. I told him what we had experienced and that we would be returning if it continued. According to the flight attendants after landing; the smell was significant in the back of the plane and they said their eyes were burning as well. Upon arriving back at the gate; we were met by ARFF personnel and [Company] Maintenance. Firefighters boarded the plane and noticed the fumes as well; which were still present. The mechanic said they had done a 'compressor wash' the previous night and that it was his opinion that oil may have been freed from the compressors and entered the cabin. I was handed a Smoke/Fumes/Odor Form to fill out; which I did and returned it to Station Operations. Although some of the flight attendants complained to me about headaches and eyes burning; they declined to be checked out and told Inflight Operations they were fine and good to continue. I called the [Duty Manager] and we completed the human factors checklist. My Chief Pilot called to check on us and we said that while we may change our fit-for-duty status; for now; we were OK to continue. After talking about this more with the First Officer; we decided we were no longer fit for duty and advised the [Duty Manager].,B737 flight crew reported a significant fume event shortly after takeoff resulting in an air return.

This was day two of a three day for me and due to reassignment my original FO (First Officer) was not on the trip on this day. This was mine and the FO's first leg together. Everything was normal with preflight. The aircraft was towed up to the gate by Ground Personnel about an hour before departure and preparation was normal. I was expecting RWY XXL for takeoff; but when we called for taxi we were assigned RWY XY. FO accomplished the Before Taxi checklist and as we were taxiing out the Before Takeoff checklist was accomplished. We believe we checked everything and did the checklist in accordance with company procedures. Takeoff and climbout were normal. I was the PF (Pilot Flying) and was hand flying the aircraft until the [situation]. Passing 10;000 feet. I chimed the flight attendants as we continued climbing. Passing through approximately 12;500 feet. the Cabin Altitude warning illuminated and the aural horn came on. We donned our oxygen masks and told Center controller we were leveling at 13;000 feet. I then instructed FO to tell Center we needed a descent to 10;000 feet. The only light either of us ever saw was the red Cab Alt light. The FO got the QRH out and started the checklist. We were cleared to descend to 8;000 feet and the light extinguished at some point passing below 10;000 feet. The cabin altitude showed approximately 10;800 feet at the highest. The passenger oxygen masks did not deploy. We returned to ZZZ and landed on RWY XY. Taxi in and shutdown was normal. After we landed we discussed the event and I asked the FO if the switches on the Engine Bleeds; Packs and Crossfeeds we're out of position. He stated he couldn't remember (nor could I); but he thought they were. We both felt certain they were correctly positioned; but the more we questioned ourselves we both admitted we were not 100% certain.My thoughts are that we were not complacent in our preparation nor in accomplishing the checklists; nor were we rushed or distracted; but it is possible that the switches were in the incorrect position on takeoff and got positioned correctly during the [situation] and we simply don't recall either one of us moving them. Neither of us noticed any pressure surges before; during or after. It's possible they occurred and due to the warning horn and mask usage we didn't notice. I should have done a better job of instructing the FO not to touch anything prior to following the steps in the QRH. Also; it took us a while to get the warning horn off; which combined with using the oxygen masks and communicating with ATC and the flight attendants was distracting. Also; since I was hand flying the aircraft when the [situation] occurred; I wish I had immediately gotten the autopilot on. I would have been able to observe and manage the situation in a better way. After landing I asked him if he checked the pressurization per the After Takeoff checklist and he said he's not sure. We certainly have checklists that; if followed correctly; would/should trap these errors. I felt totally comfortable right up to the instant the warning horn and light came on. We weren't rushed; I was well rested and alert. I always make sure that when challenged with 'AC and Bleeds' during the Before Takeoff checklist that I physically point to the Pack AND Engine Bleed switches; making sure they are correctly positioned before I respond 'Auto and Set'. It's possible that the switches were in the incorrect position and that I looked; but didn't notice. I thought I was always diligent in doing this; but as I write this; I wonder if I saw what I wanted to see rather than where the switches actually were. I honestly am not 100% sure.Maintenance checked the aircraft thoroughly; including a pressure check; and found no discrepancies. The aircraft logbook was signed off and we were scheduled to continue our sequence to ZZZ1. I discussed with the FO that we needed to have our minds totally on the current flight and offered to take him off the trip and assured him there would be no repercussions if he felt he would be distracted while continuing the flight. He assured me he was fine; as was I. I briefed the FO that we would NOT discuss this event at all during our flight to ZZZ1 and I asked him if he felt good and able to fly. He responded that he felt good. We both elected to continue on to ZZZ1. I have told you exactly what happened to the absolute best of my ability. I instructed the FO to put in his own words what we experienced and what he thinks happened.Going forward; my intent is to get the autopilot on sooner. Also; I felt like it could have been better run if I had transferred control to him and I had run the QRH; notified ATC; Dispatch; the Flight Attendants and such. It all got completed; just could have been smoother. I hadn't thought about silencing the Cabin Altitude Warning horn in a long time. Today was a reminder that on any given day. Going forward; I'm doubling my effort to verify checklist items; expect the unexpected and follow all checklists precisely; brush up on all systems and to more fluidly and smoothly transition into the situation. I can assure that this will not happen again.,B737-800 flight Crew reported a cabin pressurization malfunction during climb that resulted in a return to the departure airport and uneventful landing.

Checking the engine indications showed nothing abnormal nor out of limits. The Number 2 engine had slightly higher vibrations at 2.1. The Captain disconnected the autopilot and auto-throttles; and began reducing thrust. With the power back the vibrations did subside. During the descent the Captain added power on the #1 engine and we soon heard and felt what seemed similar to a compressor stall. The Captain returned the engine to idle and used #2 engine for power as necessary; however we still did not have any abnormal engine indications. At that time we notified ATC and requested direct to the field as well as Runway XXR. On the way into landing we reviewed the QRH for engine high vibration; engine severe damage; and engine limit or surge or stall. We also planned for a possible single engine flaps 15 landing just in case the Number 1 engine failed on final. All engine indications were still normal up until about a three to four mile final when the Number 1 engine vibrations began to increase with the throttle at or near idle. The highest vibration that I saw was about 3.4.Once we landed; Tower told us that they saw possible flames from the Number 1 engine and fire and rescue told us of smoke from the engine. We ran the Engine fire QRH to shut down and secure the engine; we did not fire the bottle however since we did not have any internal fire indications and the fire department was in the process of spraying the engine. We coordinated with the Fire Department and Maintenance on the field and when they agreed everything looked safe we were towed to the gate for deplaning.,B737-800 flight crew reported possible Number 1 engine compressor stall.

The other Relief Pilot and myself were on break for roughly an hour when we were asked to return to the cockpit due to a divert and medical emergency. Once we returned to the flight deck we coordinated with ATC; Dispatch and Maintenance regarding the divert and sick passenger. It was determined by all involved that continuing to ZZZ was not an option and ZZZ1 was the best choice in order to protect the operation and take care of the ill passenger. In addition; during the divert phase of the flight (last 1:30); we were in contact with Dispatch and Maintenance to determine whether or not we should dump fuel or land overweight. After a thorough discussion; we decided to dump 100;000 lbs. of fuel. During the dump process; one of the fuel nozzles failed. It caused the dump rate to be cut in half. This added another layer of complexity to the divert. We called Maintenance again to see if they could offer any help; which they could not. At this point; the entire cockpit crew came together to brainstorm and make sure all SOP was complied with. The Medical Guide and Diversion Planning Guide were pulled out in order to ensure we had not forgotten anything. The flight attendants and passengers were briefed; and; most of all; we thoroughly briefed the approach; landing; and ground phase in order to ensure the medical personnel ability to reach the passenger in the rear of the aircraft at the gate in a timely fashion.Once we arrived in ZZZ1 and parked at the gate we were all quite exhausted due to the medical divert and high workload. At that point a representative from Flight Operations entered the flight deck and asked if we would continue on to ZZZ. We all discussed our current state and came to the conclusion we did not feel safe continuing. The Flight Operations Rep. then said they needed one First Officer as they had found a Captain and one First Officer. At that point we had been on duty for approximately 8 hours and with a proposed scheduled departure of XA:30 for ZZZ would have added an additional 9 hours of duty; resulting in a roughly 18 hour duty day; if the flight would in fact depart at XA:30. At that point I did not feel fit and comfortable continuing to ZZZ and believe it would not have been safe; especially taking into account our current state of mind and additional duty time.Ultimately; it was my desire to continue and not delay the passengers any further; however; with safety in mind it simply was not prudent to continue.,B777 First Officer reported that a passenger illness resulted in a diversion.

The Captain had requested I investigate. I inspected the wing and immediately noticed a stream of fluid emanating from the top of the left wing from the fuel cap. I returned to the flight deck. I'd already briefed the crew on this same situation having experienced it the month before on the same aircraft. We read through the QRH procedure but agreed it would not be prudent to shut down an engine and that it would make the situation worse. We reviewed the FOM diversion guide. We agreed it was prudent to divert as we had no way of knowing how severe the leak was and we certainly didn't want to be over an ocean with fuel leaking. We would be landing overweight (even after dumping fuel); and began looking for airports with longer; dry runways. We felt ZZZZ was our best option and advised ATC. After some time; ATC advised us that ZZZZ would not take us for a fuel leak despite our [priority] status and they felt it was unusual for us to be passing other airports. We explained that we had assessed those airports and that there was either insufficient runway lengths or wet runways and that we were overweight. We landed in ZZZZ1 safely (originally we elected not to go there because of the wet runway but then dispatch indicated it was dry). Passengers seemed to be in good spirits until we got to baggage claim and then they were irritated by the slowness of getting their luggage. There was also some difficulty (because of staffing limitations); getting passengers to the busses despite there being numerous announcements over the airport PA system.,B767 flight crew reported a fuel leak that resulted in a diversion.

Flight Attendant B described it as a strong; pungent; metallic smell. I agree with the description after smelling it. Flight Attendant B said she feels light headed and nauseous. We both have a metallic taste in our mouths and headaches. I called the Captain from the back galley and alerted the Captain to the smell. He recommends that we clean the area with club soda and Sanicom wipes. Flight Attendant B wiped down the floors and the air vents are helping move the smell. The Captain suggested asking the passengers in the back if they can smell it; but they are all currently sleeping. We have requested a cleaning crew to meet the aircraft. We also asked for Maintenance and an Inflight Supervisor and decided to keep [Catering] from opening the aft door until the smell was investigated.The plane was met by three Inflight supervisors as well by Aircraft Tech; Maintenance and Captain XX who is a friend of mine and is well versed in the emergency medical I had on another [aircraft] with a toxic smell. Maintenance mopped the area well and both doors were opened for circulation. I believe the determination was made that a now discontinued form disinfecting solution was over used by contract cleaners causing a build up of excess product in the entry door vents and surrounding areas causing the toxic smell.Flight Attendant B was pulled from the flight and was replaced due to still feeling nauseous and light headed. The smell did not return on the next two flights.,B737-700 flight attendants reported chemical odor permeating the aft galley causing the B Flight Attendant to experience physiological issues and removal from subsequent flights.

Autothrottle disengaged on its own. After testing thrust lever modulation to confirm engine vibration; I directed First Officer to accomplish ENGINE HIGH VIBRATION QRH checklist. Requested priority handling with ATC. There was never a non-normal indication on the #2 vibration gauge (it never displayed above 0.8) but vibration was obvious. With #2 thrust lever at idle position; vibration largely ceased and engine remained at idle for remainder of flight. I ran TEST with purser and made PA to passengers. First Officer attempted to contact Maintenance Control through ARINC but that ultimately proved difficult and I directed him to abort that effort to support me for arrival. Workload management at times was somewhat challenging. I directed First Officer to perform ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE QRH checklist. Remainder of flight was run per single-engine SOP. Approach and landing uneventful. I had forgotten to select an autobrake setting but the aircraft stopped easily with manual braking. Excellent support from airport emergency services once on the ground. Fire crews looked at engine and noted no visible defects. Uneventful taxi to gate except that engine generated notable smoke cloud at shutdown; which was noted by fire crew. We deplaned passengers via jetway.,B737 flight crew reported an engine failure during cruise resulting in a diversion.

It is being written from the perspective of the First Officer (FO).Background: A flight had cancelled in ZZZ earlier in the day resulting in this flight being booked to capacity. Weather in the ZZZ terminal area was rain; temperatures below 10C and low IFR conditions. Light and moderate rain echoes (WSI) prevailed to the east of ZZZ; but it was determined that it would not impact our route of flight. The Dispatcher for this flight planned a northerly route at FL290 to avoid a SIGMET for severe mountain wave over southern State X as well as moderate turbulence forecasted at the higher altitudes. Departure from ZZZ was routine. We had a total of X SOB [Souls on Board] and our takeoff weight was approximately 195;000lbs. We were cleared to join our filed route and were advised to expect moderate turbulence while climbing through 25;000 to our filed altitude of 29;000. Upon coordination from ATC; we climbed to FL310 to avoid reported areas of turbulence. While initially there was occasional moderate; turbulence conditions and flight visibility improved as we approached ZZZ2. Approaching ZZZ3 at FL310 in mostly smooth visual conditions; the aircraft abruptly shuttered. The pitch changed notably 2 degrees; the FO screens momentarily blinked and the aircraft climbed/descended slightly. Both the Captain and I were suddenly on high alert. Moments later the following ECAM appeared: 'ELEC GEN 2 FAULT.' The Captain and I proceeded with the non-normal methodology. The Captain was PF for this leg and he resumed aircraft control with the AP on. I conducted the ECAM actions and follow up. The attempt to reset GEN 2 was unsuccessful; noting that the singular time the GEN was reset the aircraft shuttered again. (I theorize that this was due to power interruptions to the ELACS). Conducting the Follow up procedure; the APU was started. The APU began to spool up normally and it was anticipated that the APU would power the buses serving as a second source of power. As the APU came up to speed; I heard multiple relays begin to 'Click' from behind our seats. Shortly thereafter; the APU faulted and conducted an Auto-Shutdown. In discussion of this with the Captain; we decided not to attempt another APU start. Looking at the ELEC page on the lower ECAM; we noted that all buses were powered; main galley was shed; and GEN1 had picked up the entire electrical load. There were no other ECAMs for the remainder of the flight. At this point the aircraft was being powered by a single electrical source which was an emergency condition. This was confirmed by the QRH procedure which stated to landing at the nearest suitable airport. The Captain and I began to assess our diversion options. To gain situational awareness relative to our geographic location and the weather system behind us; I attempted to pull up weather using the iPad. As I did this; I noticed my iPad was no longer connected to [the] flight deck. It was assumed that the aircraft's wireless network at this point was load-shed. To assist us with this decision making further; I then sent the following text message to our Dispatcher via ACARS (this is not verbatim; but it is something close to what I believe I sent). 'EMERGENCY. ENG 2 GEN FAULT; APU FAILED TO START; WE ARE SINGLE GEN OPS. NEED TO DIVERT.' At this point it was expected that the Dispatcher would assist us with choosing the best suitable airport for landing given the condition of the aircraft. The following ACARS exchange took place:Dispatch: 'COPY MSG... YOU LOST BOTH APU AND ENG GEN... WHERE YOU WANT TO DIVERT... DISP XYZ.'Pilots (not verbatim): We stated that we were thinking of either ZZZ4 or ZZZ5.Dispatch: 'NEITHER ZZZ4 OR ZZZ5 IS IN C70 FOR AIRBUS BUT DOESN'T MATTER WITH EMERGENCY... YOU WANT ME TO CALL ZZZ5.'After this message both the Captain and I began to assess which airport would be more suitable. The Captain referenced the diversion guide and noted that both KZZZ5 and KZZZ4 were listed as adequate. We considered ZZZ6; but it was significantly south and in an area of the turbulence and mountain wave.Since we were overweight (now 187;000 lbs) we conducted a landing assessment. Given the Field Elevation at ZZZ4; along with its runway length; our landing assessment at Flaps 3 came to 9091 feet. This distance exceeded the runway length available. KZZZ5; which was still 80 miles ahead; offered us a [longer] runway with two ILS approaches. The weather was also good VFR (230/12 10sm FEW085 9/m09); the field elevation was not as high; and there were two ILS approaches available for landing. In consideration of the potential for a GEN 1 loss resulting in an EMER ELEC Configuration; combined with weather and terrain issues; the Captain and I concluded that a diversion to KZZZ5 was the safest course of action. We informed the Dispatcher that we had chosen KZZZ5. The following ACARS message was received:Dispatch: 'ZZZ5 ISN'T QUALIFIED TO WORK AIRBUS HE SAID...ZZZ4 IS MAINLINE; DO YOU WANT TO GO THERE...'I responded that we were too heavy to land in ZZZ4 and that the landing distance was too excessive. We had chosen KZZZ5.Dispatch: 'COPY NEW DEST IS ZZZ5... OPS FREQ IS XXX.XXX'The Captain and I discussed this again; and we reaffirmed amongst ourselves that KZZZ5 is the safest choice; despite there being little services there upon landing. We concluded that we would deal with this issue later; that the most important issue at hand is to land the aircraft safely with; hopefully; at least 1 generator still working. At this point the Captain made a PA announcement and also began coordinating with the Flight Attendants. I took aircraft control (briefly) and informed ATC that we needed to divert to KZZZ5 due to an electrical issue. When [notifying ATC]; I provided SOB and FOB (Fuel on Board). ATC was already aware that we were working an issue and knew that we were actively deciding the most suitable airport. We entered the new destination into the MCDU and set up for the approach. We conducted the Non-Normal landing considerations to make sure nothing was forgotten. Approaching KZZZ5; both the Captain and I felt we needed more time to prepare for the overweight landing. We elected to hold on a waypoint of the approach to complete the checklist. This also enabled us to burn additional weight. We felt that this was a safe decision; and worst case the runway was in sight and we would be able to land visually if needed. As we entered the hold at ZZZZZ (XXR) we began the overweight landing checklist. Given the time compression; I struggled to find the correct page in the QRH. Eventually I found it and began to go through each item. There were two challenges associated with this checklist (in addition to trying to find it).1) Slowing the aircraft below green dot to VLS in order to lower FLAPS 1 without a FLAP overspeed. This was accomplished without issue.2) When deciding whether to land FLAPS 3 or FLAPS Full we referenced the table on page X. Given the field elevation I used the 4;000 feet column. With the temperature of 9'C I determined that to land Flaps Full we would need to be below 181;000. We were at 182;000; but given the fuel burn while holding it was decided that we would be below 181;000 lbs once accepting the approach; therefore we could safely land using Flaps Full. In the holding pattern; we made one final PA to the passengers that they would be seeing ARFF equipment and to not be alarmed. The ensuing landing was uneventful. We used the max available runway and the brake temps remained below 400 degrees.Upon clearing the runway; I called the Station Ops from the frequency the Dispatcher provided us. The manager answered and told us we were to park at [gate] and that they had never worked an Airbus before.Upon parking at [gate]; the jetway pulled up to the L1 door.The manager knocked on the cockpit window to ask us how to open the L1 door. All doors were disarmed and we told him to lift up the handle; which he did. Now the question to be asked was about deplaning the aircraft. The Captain was largely involved with this process. The station manager was told by someone in [hub] that the aircraft would need to be deplaned using the rear exit due to CG issues; otherwise a tail-stand would need to be found. Both the Captain and I had never heard of this before. In addition; the airport would need to bring air-stairs to the aircraft and the passengers would have to walk outside on the ramp area and up the Jet-Bridge stairs in order to access the terminal. After much back and forth between [hub] and ZZZ5; it was determined that the passengers could exit out the L1 door; but should be accomplished very slowly. Some passengers elected to remain on board; while most deplaned. The KZZZ5 station team is to be commended. The remaining crew had come to airport to assist; as most were on their day off. In total; we had approximately 6 station personal to service the entire aircraft. Once the passengers deplaned; the Captain recognized that there was little offerings inside the terminal for food and refreshment. The Captain decided to order 40 Pizzas along with 20 2L soft drinks in order to keep the passengers calm and respectful of the assistance we were trying to provide. This decision proved to be highly effective; as the passengers were very appreciative of our efforts over the ensuing 5 hours. After coordination with the Scheduling; Dispatch and Maintenance; it was determined that [company] would send a rescue A321 from ZZZ7 to KZZZ5 to pick up our passengers and bring them the rest of the way to ZZZ1. After review of our duty limits; we were limited in our duty day (even with extension) so the inbound crew would take these passengers to ZZZ1. During these coordinating efforts; the Captain made an entry into the maintenance logbook. The entry reflected the failed generator; APU fault and overweight landing. Maintenance Control informed us that despite landing overweight; there would be no inspection required since the Airbus AMM did not require one. The write-up and load report were delivered to Maintenance Control via email. After further review the next day; there was concern that a separate write up with the overweight landing was needed. Maintenance Control reiterated that this was not needed since no inspection was required. After review of the FOM; the Captain made a separate entry and the Maintenance technicians flown in from ZZZ7 signed off the write up. In order to provide a gate for this A321; the station needed to push our aircraft to the hardstand. This involved a high amount of coordination because the station did not have a tug nor tow-bar to do this job. A former [company] employee who used to be in ZZZ7 now worked for [other company] in KZZZ5 and assisted us with this effort. He was able to find the appropriate tug and tow-bar for the job. A second issue came up. The A321 departing ZZZ7 would incur a 3-hour catering delay. In order to reduce this turn-around time on the passengers; the Dispatcher asked us to remove all the galley carts from the aircraft in order to service the inbound A321. We did so and placed the galley carts in the jet-bridge. The ramp crew did not know how to open the cargo doors. After consultation with Maintenance we resolved this issue as well and the ramp crew was able to unload all the baggage from the forward and aft cargo holds (beginning with the aft first). While all this was taking place; the pizza and drinks arrived for the passengers. It should be noted that at this point all the FAs [Flight Attendants] were eager to get to the hotel. They were visibly angry from their exchanges with crew scheduling and did nothing during this entire process to assist with the passengers on the aircraft nor in the terminal. Upon receiving their hotel information fr,A321 flight crew reported that the Number 2 Generator faulted in flight; and APU would not start; requiring a diversion and overweight landing.

We were told our new landing runway was XXL. Due to being briefed; configured; runway Analysis; Localizer frequency set and identified; Approach being in the GPS with points verified; I told ATC I wanted XXR. We were told we would be landing XXL because it would work out better. Another aircraft was in front of us landing XXL. I again told ATC we wanted XXR. At this point ATC had other aircraft off our side. Against my will ATC basically overrode the Captain's authority. Also in the middle of the situation I requested the localizer frequency for the runway ATC was basically forcing me to go to. Their response - 'we will get back to you.' Another aircraft gave us the frequency.Suggestions: Better training for ATC.,B767-300 Captain reported a loss of left engine oil pressure during final descent phase to destination.  Captain's requests for the preferred landing runway were denied by ATC.

Both pilots donned oxygen masks. I advised ATC and requested immediate descent and clearance direct to ZZZ. I ran the emergency checklists while the First Officer flew us to ZZZ. After running QA-5 checklist; the fumes decreased significantly. The First Officer performed a smooth overweight landing at ZZZ. I taxied to the gate. There were no injuries or illnesses from the event.,A319 flight crew reported a burning smell in the cabin that resulted in a diversion.

Engine 2 Sensor and Engine 2 FADEC B. ECAM procedures were completed. Shortly thereafter another ECAM; Auto Thrust came on. While dealing with that; Engine 2 Start Valve Open came on for a few seconds; then went away. Within a few seconds after that; Engine Surge came on and engine 2 began surging. I immediately requested descent to FL240 and the First Officer pulled the #2 thrust lever to idle; at which time the engine stabilized; so we elected to keep it running. At this point; we decided to divert to ZZZ; which was about 60nm behind us. The First Officer continued flying and operated the radios and set up for the approach while I dealt with remaining QRH procedures; contacting Dispatch; the flight attendants; and making the PA for passengers to notify them that we were diverting to Nashville due to a maintenance issue. We [requested priority handling] and ATC cleared us direct to ZZZ. We elected to land on Runway XX; since winds were calm and it was the longest runway. We were very close to the airport. In order to lose altitude we were given some extended vectors. ARFF (Airport Rescue Firefighting) was standing by for us. We executed the RNAV/GPS approach to Runway XX; leaving engine 2 at idle and using manual thrust; as the autothrust was also inoperative. Because I had more time in the aircraft than my First Officer; I elected to do the landing; so at approximately 15;000 ft. I took over pilot flying duties. The landing was overweight but uneventful. We taxied clear of the runway and stopped to give ARFF a chance to evaluate the status of the aircraft. They gave us the all clear and followed us to the gate. It's difficult to adequately describe the somewhat chaotic nature of events on the flight deck due to the intermittent and continuous ECAM indications that came and went during the entire event. The Start Valve Open indication repeated intermittently at least twice; possibly three times; and there were some other intermittent indications which came and went; all to do with Engine 2. Once the engine stabilized at idle; the ECAM abnormals cleared; except for the original two - Engine 2 Sensor and Engine 2 FADEC B. Once at the gate; and after ensuring that the passengers were taken care of; I talked to the local mechanic and wrote up the event in the logbook; to include the overweight landing as well as giving him the error messages that printed out after shutdown. Most likely; a failure of FADEC B which appears to have caused multiple engine malfunctions.,A321 flight crew reported an engine malfunction during cruise that resulted in a diversion and overweight landing.

No smoke was observed. No passengers complained. The two forward flight attendants went back and confirmed the smell; but were not exposed very long. The two aft flight attendants were exposed longer and complained of throat and chest pain. We elected to turn around and divert to ZZZ. The two aft flight attendants were taken for medical care. No one else was affected. On ground in ZZZ; passengers disembarked. ARFF personnel scanned the aft galley area with thermal imaging equipment and noticed nothing overheating. A mechanic searched the aft galley area and smelled nothing with the packs off; but did notice smell when right pack was turned on. Apparently something wrong in right pack causing fumes.,B737-800 Captain reported medical diversion after being notified by flight attendants of 'burning plastic/electrical fire' odor causing physiological issues. Two flight attendants received medical treatment.

When we arrived at the airport he used the restroom and met me at the airplane. We performed our duties. Once airborne and 30 minutes enroute; he needed to use the restroom. He did throw up in a bag while in the cockpit. But he said he felt a little better afterwards. Halfway to [destination] he started to get the chills and put on his jacket. We discussed if we should divert or continue on. We elected to continue to destination. Restroom was used two more times. Each time feeling slightly better for the moment. We discussed having him sit in the [cabin] versus sitting in [cockpit] and having a FA take his role. We elected to keep everyone in their assigned duties. We landed without incident. Once we were taxiing to [the] gate; we notified Operations to send EMS over to the gate. All passengers disembarked the airplane as normal. Once everyone was off the airplane; the medical personnel showed up to give him assistance. Ultimately he was taken to the ER under the EMS care.,B737NG Captain reported that the F/O experienced stomach illness enroute to destination.

The Captain called Maintenance Control while I flew. I referenced drift down altitude; speed from the FMC and referred to the QRH for low oil pressure checklist and the following engine shutdown checklist since low oil quantity is not included.At approximately XA29; Engine Number 1 oil quantity at 0% and engine oil pressure began fluctuating from 45 PSI to 33 and lower in the amber band. By XA40; oil pressure was approaching red band. At approximately XA40; the Captain and I shut down Engine Number 1. The Captain and I decided along with Dispatch; after discussing with Maintenance Control; that ZZZ was the best location to divert to. I accomplished a visual landing to Runway XXL; backed up by the ILS XXL. Winds were 330/7; autobrake 3. Crash recovery/fire looked over the aircraft after the landing. All clear; we taxied to Gate XX. Taxi on to the gate was uneventful. This does not include all actions that were performed but those I can recall from memory [that] feel important.,B737 flight crew reported a loss of oil quantity and drop in oil pressure in the Number 1 Engine and decided to shut the engine down and divert. An uneventful landing and taxi in was made.

The aircraft was very light. Rate of climb was higher than usual given the light weight; in excess of 4;000 feet per minute. TCAS alerted us to traffic passing above at 10;000 [feet] with a 'Traffic; Traffic' call followed immediately by a Resolution Advisory to 'Level Off.' I complied by lowering the pitch attitude to just below the Resolution Pitch Advisory indication on the ADI. The Clear of Conflict annunciation quickly followed and the climb to 10;000 feet was completed. Our aircraft was never closer than 3;000 feet to the target aircraft; we never completely leveled off or deviated from an assigned altitude.,B737NG Captain reported responding to an RA departing IAD.

The inbound crew recorded an aircraft discrepancy in the AML for a 'BLEED TRIP OFF' on final approach into ZZZ; which the prior crew noted was successfully reset using QRH procedures.At the direction of Company Maintenance; an engine run was performed in ZZZ in accordance with Company Maintenance procedures to evaluate the status of previously noted BLEED TRIP OFF write up prior to logbook sign off. A Contract Maintenance Technician overseen by Company Maintenance provided test card procedure; accompanied the two pilots for an off-gate medium/high power engine run. The results of the engine run procedure indicated normal pneumatic system operation with no defects noted.After the engine run; the aircraft returned to the gate so that bags could be loaded and passengers boarded. At XA33; the aircraft departed ZZZ enroute for ZZZ1. Normal systems operations were noted for taxi; takeoff; climb - with intermittent level-offs - and approximately 35-minutes of cruise flight at FL380. A very slight pressure bump was felt which coincided with the R BLEED TRIP OFF light illuminating on the Pneumatics System overhead panel. After identifying the Pilot Flying; the QRH was referenced for the appropriate checklist procedure. The BLEED TRIP OFF light failed to reset; which resulted in the R A/C Pack being placed in the 'OFF' position in compliance with QRH procedure.Shortly after the completion of the QRH procedure; the crew discussed and agreed that a descent from FL380 to a lower altitude and lower PSID would probably be a wise course of action. A lower altitude was requested and ATC began to coordinate and approve the aircraft descent. Upon passing approximately FL360; the cabin altitude was noted to be rising and the red CABIN ALTITUDE Warning light illuminated; accompanied by the warning horn. The QRC and QRH were referenced for the appropriate procedures. With the gradual loss of cabin pressurization; not immediately arrested by procedure; the crew complied with emergency descent procedures and [requested priority handling] with ATC. The cabin altitude continued to climb; which was noted to top out at nearly 12;000 feet on the pressurization dial; while the emergency descent procedure was maintained.The aircraft was leveled at 10;000 MSL; and the cabin was still partially pressurized. A check with the cabin crew confirmed that the passenger oxygen masks had not deployed. The flight diverted to ZZZ2 where an uneventful approach and landing were executed. All passengers and crew deplaned normally and without any noted issues.,B737 flight crew reported a recurrence of a BLEED TRIP OFF light inflight; causing a loss of cabin pressure; and resulting in a diversion and precautionary emergency landing.

Captain PM; First Officer PF.Felt a vibration and noticed engine 2 roll back N1 to about 50% accompanied by ENG 2 STALL ECAM which directed us to turn on engine ignition. After ignition selected on; N1 returned to normal cruise setting but was accompanied by N2 vibration of about 4.5 units.ECAM complete; QRH referenced for ENGINE STALL. That checklist directed us to bring thrust lever on affected engine to idle and check engine indications. If abnormal; it directs to shut the engine off.When thrust lever was brought to idle; engine 2 again stalled accompanied by N2 vibration of about 9.9 units. With engine stalled and apparent damage; we continued to shut down engine 2.At this point; A position Flight Attendant called and advised vibrations felt and flames observed exiting engine 2 tail pipe. I told him we were aware and working on it and would call him back. As we ran ECAM to shut down engine 2; we began our descent to FL240. Remaining engine able to maintain managed speed. Once engine 2 secured and APU started; we re with Center. They cleared us to descend landing south. Called A position Flight Attendant and gave him NTSB with 20 minutes remaining and NO brace command. Had him prepare cabin for normal arrival and landing; advised would be stopping on runway and they would see fire trucks approach the airplane to ensure engine 2 safe enough for us to taxi to the gate. Made a PA to guests; advising them of situation.Approach vectored us and cleared us for ILS in VMC to XXR. Flaps 3 landing; stopped on XXR just short of Taxiway XX. Made PA advising guests to remain seated; all was fine; and the fire trucks were approaching to ensure that we were safe to continue taxiing to the gate. CFR advised no visible problems with engine 2 except oil leaking. Tower and ground controllers then cleared us to our gate with CFR following us to the gate. At the gate; CFR came on board and asked if further assistance required. We declined and they left. Guests deplaned normally; maintenance logbook entry made; and maintenance personnel met us to inspect the engine. Engine 2 oil quantity about 10 quarts at completion of flight. Also met by 2 Inflight Supervisors who joined us as we debriefed Flight Attendants.,A319 flight crew reported multiple engine stalls; so crew elected to shut down the Number 2 engine and make a precautionary landing at destination.

Our fuel amount was above planned minimum fuel at takeoff. The FO (First Officer) was the PF (Pilot Flying). The CA (Captain) was the PM (Pilot Monitoring). The flight was proceeding without incident and all fuel indications were normal until the Captain was preparing to shut off the center fuel pumps. He noticed a fuel imbalance of 300-400 lbs. The CA corrected the fuel imbalance. It then became imbalanced again in a relatively short amount of time. It was at this time that we both observed a drastic drop in fuel on the left main tank. It showed a loss of approximately 500 lbs. in about 3 minutes. I know that fuel fluctuations can be normal when the center fuel pumps are shut off but this seemed excessive. The rate of fuel loss from the left tank seemed to slow after that initial drop but we were closely monitoring the amounts and observed an imbalance of approx. 900 lbs. Once the fuel amount on the left tank stabilized we started discussing the possible cause of the fluctuations. And it was at that time that we started watching the total fuel burns more intently. Prior to the all of this happening; the recorded fuel burn at ZZZ2 on the flight plan was 400 lbs. over scheduled burn which seemed slightly unusual for the conditions but as we watched the FMC planned burn at ZZZ3 we realized that we were going to be over the scheduled burn by almost 2;000 lbs.; which was excessive. According to the scheduled flight plan fuel burn; the fuel amount at ZZZ3 should have been 15.4. We crossed ZZZ3 with 13.5 indicated. We believed that we could have a fuel leak due to the amount of fuel loss in such a short amount of time and the fact that the total amount of fuel onboard was much lower than planned.The CA went into the QRH and went to the Fuel Leak - Engine checklist. We agreed that we met the criteria for the checklist and continued. The CA proceeded with the checklist; talked to the FAs (Flight Attendants); and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance. We asked the FAs to check for evidence of a fuel leak. The FA said they saw moisture on the left wing; but not the right wing; and the FA did not see mist coming from the wing. The CA's wife was also onboard the plane. She is a professional pilot so we asked her to check for evidence of a fuel leak. She reiterated what the FA said about moisture on the wing; but no mist spotted. While the CA was doing that; I was pulling the weather for ZZZ4 and ZZZ. Both airports looked good but the nearest airport was ZZZ. I selected the frequency and course for the runway listed on ATIS in case we decided to go there. We proceeded with the checklist. The CA requested a descent to our drift down altitude of 22;000 ft.; briefed the FAs; advised the passengers; requested priority handling; pulled landing data for ZZZ; and shut down the left engine per the checklist. I was flying the aircraft and talking to ATC when needed.While all this was going on we were trying to communicate with Dispatch. They were asking a lot of questions via ACARS; we were very busy; and it seemed quicker to ask them to contact us via the ZZZ Operations frequency since the aircraft didn't have SATCOM. This proved difficult because we couldn't get a hold of ZZZ Operations and Dispatch couldn't hear us reply on that frequency. We finally talked to Operations once we were much closer but we never had a chance to talk to Dispatch in the air.I landed the aircraft single engine and slightly overweight at approximately 146;000 lbs. for a Flaps 15 landing; normally max of 144;200. The landing was uneventful and at a normal rate of descent. We taxied to the gate under our own power.,Flight Crew reported increasing fuel loss in flight; which resulted in an engine shutdown and diversion.

During cruise; FL370; (1 hr from scheduled touchdown) we received a green hydraulic low ECAM followed 2 min later by a low pressure ECAM of the green pump. ECAM was initiated by the Captain. PF (Pilot Flying) duties were transferred to the FO (First Officer) and Dispatch was contacted via ACARS. After discussing options with crew and Dispatch ZZZ was determined as the landing location. Priority handling was requested from ATC and inflight was briefed with what to expect. After all members of the team were up to speed the Captain informed the passengers what to expect. FO continued the PF duties through the descent with a thorough landing briefing. Runway XXL was requested as it was the longest available runway. Once we were released to approach control duties were reversed; Captain PF and FO was PM (Pilot Monitoring). At roughly 15 miles from touchdown Captain called for gravity gear extension from the QRH as per the the briefing. Once on the ground the aircraft was stopped on the runway while fire crash and rescue did a thorough inspection of the aircraft. It was determined that the aircraft was safe to taxi to the gate under its own power. After reaching the gate the Captain made a PA allowing for any questions from the passengers. Passengers were unloaded with no delay. After all checklist items were completed; Maintenance Control; Dispatch; and Assistant Chief on duty was contacted. Timely debrief took place with inflight team; Maintenance personnel on the ground; and Customer Service. Ground Maintenance confirmed hydraulic quantity was low on the Green system and hydraulic fluid was leaking from the Number 1 Pylon. No additional comments added.Work load was significantly increased due to the amount of deferrals on this aircraft. I have a growing concern of the sheer amount of deferrals I've observed on Airbus aircraft in recent months.,A320 First Officer reported receiving two hydraulic system malfunction messages during cruise; which resulted in a diversion and successful landing.

After blocking in; ZZZ Maintenance told us; that they had done an engine wash the previous night. We were the first departure afterwards. Re-examine the engine wash procedure. This was my second odor and fumes event after an engine wash. Both ended in priority returns to the departure airport. The pack burn after an engine wash is apparently done at 70% power. Takeoff power is much higher!,B737-800 flight crew and Flight Attendant reported a 'dirty socks; musty' odor during takeoff and executed an air return.

FO looked a bit pale and certainly uncomfortable and said he needed to use the restroom. After summoning the A FA (Flight Attendant) to the cockpit; I heard a commotion in the front galley as the FO was exiting the flight deck. After looking back; I saw the legs of the FO on the ground. I immediately told the A FA to close the door and have a seat. At this point my position was around 300 miles north east of ZZZ at FL360. I referenced my manual on the procedures for incapacitated crew members and determined our next course of action. After about 5 minutes of communicating with the FAs on the condition of the FO they informed me he was up; doing well; and had his color back to normal. I spoke with the FO over the inter-phone system and he explained he was feeling much better and believed he was ok to continue. I discussed with the A flight attendant about staying upfront in the cockpit while the FO got situated so she could help if anymore issues came up. After talking with the FO and FA as well as a PAX (Passenger) that was a nurse who treated him; we determined he was back to normal and able to continue the flight as planned. I informed the FO I would be the pilot flying for the remainder of the flight and we discussed how to proceed. I determined a diversion to another airport was not in the best interest of safety. I considered policies/weather/distance/safety of my PAX's and crew and determined the best course of action was to not try and make a complex mountainous terrain diversion. ZZZ was clear with light winds and all our pre approach duties were accomplished for ZZZ. The flight then continued without further incidence. Once on the ground I told the FO to call the on-call chief pilot to determine the next course of action. We then talked with our medical team to get an assessment of the medical event at cruise. The Doctor told us he viewed it as an isolated incident and the FO was ok to continue. After talking with the chief pilots; the FO was removed from the flight and the rest of the crew was reassigned.After running through the incapacitated crew member section of the volume 2 . I would like to add a suggestion for a crew member that was incapacitated but returns to normal after treatment. A note to call the medical team if two pilots are present to discuss returning the crew member to duty or to divert.,A320 Captain reported First Officer became incapacitated during cruise flight.

We taxied to the gate with no complications.  The passengers and crew deplaned shortly after getting to the gate.Cause: tin foil was found in the galley's oven exhaust fan. Clean the ovens.,B767 flight crew reported being notified by the flight attendants of a burning smell in the cabin during cruise prompting a diversion and uneventful landing.  Reportedly; the smell was caused by tin foil found in the galley's oven exhaust fan.

The engine would not respond to forward thrust lever movement; only to a lower thrust lever setting. Since this partial engine power was not addressed specifically in the QRH I thought that turning off the associated EEC (Electronic Engine Control) might allow us to regain control. The EEC was turned off; without effect and was turned back on. The decision to divert to ZZZ was an easy one. The Flight Attendants and Dispatch were notified. ATC was advised; vectors were provided to a Runway XX arrival.  The engine failed completely on downwind.The Engine Failure and One Engine Inop Landing QRH checklists were accomplished. The First Officer was the Flying Pilot; he continued to fly and did most of the communicating with ATC. Performance calculation flaps 15 engine out data was used and briefings completed. Aircraft control was transferred and I became the Pilot Flying.  A normal engine out flaps 15 landing was made. After clearing the runway; ZZZ Fire Rescue looked over the engine and detecting no threats; we taxied to our assigned gate.Two passenger PA's were made while airborne and one after landing. There were no Passenger issues that I was made aware of; our Flight Attendants must have done a wonderful job. My First Officer did a perfectly professional job of flying and communicating with ATC. KUDOS to all the SIM Instructors I have had over the years.,B737-700 Captain reported loss of power in the #1 engine while at cruise altitude which caused a diversion.

Was able to regain control of the cabin with manual control and proceeded to and landed normally in ZZZZ.About 30 miles or so from ZZZ all smoke alarms sounded. We had no indication of any smoke or fire. Emergency vehicles met us on landing and one followed us to gate XX. Passengers deplaned normally. All faults entered into the ELB (Electronic Logbook). This was not a rapid depressurization and no masks were deployed.,B737NG Captain reported a failure of the cabin pressurization Controller resulting in an immediate descent to 10;000 feet.

Our actions as a crew was an immediate level off and communicated with ATC. Reading the checklist came to a point of putting on shoulder harnesses; at this point I requested a turn for ZZZ. We worked together to get the airplane turned around with a new routing. The FO worked with ATC and I went back to the checklist for its completion. The last item on the checklist asked if the glass was inner or outer. In our case it was outer. Final line on checklist reads continue as normal and take off shoulder harnesses. So this is where I recognize the error; as dire as ' put on shoulder harnesses;' this was not the time to turn around. We once again discussed our situation with one another with a completed checklist and cautiously went with the checklist; that this is ok to continue to ZZZ1. Our fuel situation was fine as we proceeded to ZZZ1 fairly quickly. We were left separated in situations and busy unnecessarily. This is my disappointment.,B737 Captain reported a lack of clarity when following the checklist for a shattered cockpit window.

Once the descent began; ATC issued a traffic alert for an aircraft climbing through 5;000 feet on a southwest heading towards us that he was not talking to. I acknowledged the traffic; picked them up visually and stated we may get an alert on this traffic.My FO (First Officer) put his hands on the controls in preparation for flying manually. I then noticed the TCAS target climbing through about 5;300 feet; and within seconds we received a Climb RA. The FO manually took control of the airplane and complied with the RA.After a few blocked transmissions; we were able to advise ATC. Approach then issued a turn to 190 as we leveled around 6;300-6;400 feet. Once cleared of the conflict; we returned to 6;000 feet. The remainder of the approach was uneventful and the were no issues with our cabin crew who were performing their final cabin checks. Our altitudes were about 500-600 feet apart and the lateral distance appeared to be a similar distance.Regarding the conflicting traffic; it was a low wing; single engine general aviation aircraft; possibly a Cirrus aircraft. The conflict occurred precisely at the 20 mile DME ring of the Class B Airspace; and the aircraft was climbing as well as turning southbound at the western edge of the Class B.,B737 Captain reported taking evasive action after receiving an RA from a light aircraft on descent into EWR.

As we were descending the First Officer extended the speed brakes to help us get down.  Upon retraction to about 50 percent stowed; the aircraft rolled right about 15 degrees. Then the autopilot rolled wings level.  Once the speed brake was stowed to 25 percent it rolled again to the right 15 degrees and then it went wings level again.  After the speed brakes were fully stowed; the aircraft rolled left 15 degrees and then back to wings level.  After that we knew we had a spoiler problem and we decided we would not use the speed brakes for the remainder of the flight.  After referencing the QRH and the manuals; we requested priority handling; we notified the flight attendants and we let the passengers know with a PA.  We descended uneventfully with priority handling and landed with vehicles standing by. We taxied to the gate.  We debriefed with maintenance and the flight operations.,B737 NG Captain reported experiencing several 15 degree rolls to the right due to a possible speedbrake/spoiler malfunction during arrival flight phase. The crew landed uneventfully without the use of speedbrakes.

Executed ECAM actions. Then went to the QRH which only referred to approach degradation under current condition of the jet. My destination was ZZZ1 with forecasted weather conditions to be deteriorating to as low as vv4; 1 mile visibility. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Maintenance Control advised the condition was real and nothing could be done. Dispatch and I agreed to divert to ZZZ which was about 150 miles in front of us. Did not declare an emergency. The weather was CLR 10 plus visibility. Was cleared direct ZZZZZ for the ZZZZZ2 RNAV arrival. Vectored to the visual; Runway XXR. Cleared the visual approach. Intercepted final between ZZZZZ2 and ZZZZZ3. Approaching ZZZZZ3 we suddenly and simultaneously got EGT OVER LIMIT; ENG 2 FADAC and ENG 2 FUEL HEAT SYSTEM ECAM messages. FO; who was flying; reported having difficulty maintaining airspeed and not seeming to get power out of the Number 2 engine. Finished configuring the jet for landing and I chose to get the jet on the ground ASAP. Requested priority handling and landed all within about 1 to 2 minutes. Landed and stopped on the runway. Shut the Number 2 engine down; had the ARFF guys examine the engine for any signs of fire or over heat. They gave us the all clear and we taxied to the gate uneventfully.Suggestions: Not much; if any; guidance on our original condition. The FO and I both suspected there was more going on with the Number 2 engine which was one of the many reasons to divert.,A321 pilot reported experiencing a Number 2 engine issue at FL350 resulting in a diversion.

We were able to reengage the autopilot. The autopilot disengaged once again and the flight director biased out of view.  We asked ATC for a heading and a lower altitude to leave RVSM airspace.  We descended to FL290 and flew assigned headings from ATC.  We looked through the QRH for mode control panel failure checklist and could not locate one.  The mode control panel remained locked out for the remainder of the flight.  We continued the remainder of the flight raw data.  We evaluated the weather at ZZZ1 and several other close by airports.  The Weather was best at ZZZ for raw data.  We requested priority handling. We TESTed the flight attendants. We made PAs to the passengers to make them aware of the fire trucks on arrival.  The flight continued uneventfully to ZZZ.,B737 flight crew reported the autopilot disengaged twice during cruise flight at FL410.  The crew stated they had no QRH procedure for the failure resulting in a diversion.

She and [another] flight attendant said they felt mild symptoms of confusion & headache; but did not elect to call the flight deck till at cruise. We were de-iced after push and could have been a bit short of the 1 minute wait time in selecting ON on the engine bleeds on the second engine start; or there could have been other issues with the de-ice to cause such fumes. Further forward in the aircraft the fumes were not noted. No further fumes were noted on the flight.Always maintain caution with chemicals around the aircraft.

Once we came to a stop [we] verified that smoke was not visible and passengers were requesting to use the lavatory. Informed them to remain seated until we received further directives from the Captain and initially communicated with other Cabin Crew Members.

We then noticed the left wing tank had an amber caution imbalance and was about 1;500 lbs. lighter than the right wing tank. I asked the PIC if we were in balance before departure; and he reminded me that we both had verified the quantity and balance before taking the runway. We then passed our first fix on the fuel log and noticed we were 1;000 lbs. down. The PIC then continued to trim the aircraft to engage the autopilot; while asking me to retrieve the Fuel Imbalance Checklist from the QRH; which lead us to the Fuel Leak Engine checklist. Once I retrieved the checklist the PIC transferred control and radios of the aircraft to me for the duration of the flight. We then weighed our options. Because we were by now 2;000 lbs. light in our left tank and knowing there are not many airports between ZZZ and ZZZ1; we decided to return to ZZZ. As the Captain proceeded on with the checklist; he asked me to [advise ATC] and to start heading back to ZZZ. I asked Center for direct for the field; center then handed us off to approach. On initial check in I asked approach for straight in Runway XX; knowing that it was the longest runway with a headwind. Approach asked if we wanted the visual; I then asked for the RNAV Z Runway XX. Approach cleared us direct to TACOH to cross TACOH at 10;000 ft. and cleared for the approach. Somewhere in the process approach asked if we wanted ARFF standing by and I replied; 'affirmative'. Approach then asked for number of souls on board and fuel remaining. Meanwhile the Captain busy completing checklists; notifying flight attendants; and notifying company; informed me that the flight attendants had smelled fuel on departure. The flight attendants smelling of fuel helped us confirm that our decision to return to ZZZ was correct . Then on about a 5-10 mile left base for Runway XX; the Captain came to the part of the Fuel Leak Engine checklist that required us to shut down the left engine. We weighed our options. There was 5;000 lbs. of fuel in the left tank; the fuel leak had subsided at the low thrust setting; engine indications were normal; there was a lot of traffic in the terminal area (a missed approach wasn't out of the question); we were chose to landing; and we didn't want to do a single engine missed at a high altitude/high terrain airport. We decided to to leave the engine running and complete the decent and before landing checklist. We landed without event and I stopped the aircraft and transferred control of the aircraft to the Captain. The Captain told the passengers to remain seated as we retracted the spoilers and set flaps to 40. ARFF then advised us that there were no leaks or fire and followed us off the runway to the gate; where they boarded and checked on the status of the passengers. All of the passengers were fine. The entire flight from takeoff until touchdown lasted approximately 15 minutes. The Captain did an amazing job of delegating responsibilities among the crew while still keeping everyone in the loop. Although there was a lot to do in a short amount of time; I never once felt rushed or in the 'red'. I attribute this to the Captain setting a great tone on day one of our trip that promoted great team work and communication.,B737 flight crew reported that a fuel imbalance resulted in a return to the departure airport.

There was no smoke in the cockpit. As we climbed out of 5;000 feet; the flight attendants called and reported a strong smell of something burning and that the passengers were reporting the same smell to them.I transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer as I spoke with the flight attendants. We determined that the best course of action was to return to the airport. We requested to level off at 9;000 feet and advised ATC. I began the smoke and fumes checklist as we entered a downwind vector to return to the field. We descended and executed the Runway XX ILS approach to an overweight landing of approximately 163;000 pounds. Upon exiting the runway; we requested an inspection by crash fire rescue personnel who met the aircraft. They reported a normal heat signature on the aircraft. We returned to the terminal and parked at gate. We were met by station Maintenance Personnel to discuss the incident; and then wrote up the details for the smoke/fumes incident and the overweight landing in the AML.We loaded our passengers onto a new aircraft and departed approximately 2 hours late.I suspect that this event may have been the result of a recent engine change. Maintenance told us upon our return that there had been an engine change. Possibly some residual fluid that entered the bleed air system upon takeoff and climb at high power.I do not have any suggestions for avoiding a recurrence of this event I believe the situation was handled appropriately by both the cabin and flight deck crew when one considers the very real possibility of a potential fire.,B737 Captain reported that smoke and fumes in the cabin resulted in an air return.

The aircraft started noticeably shaking. The First Officer was flying and pulled the number one throttle to idle; the shaking lessened but did not stop. I immediately started the APU. The flight attendants were ringing the cockpit; I had cabin now on my headset and could hear they were concerned the aircraft was shaking really bad in the back and that passengers were saying sparks and flames were coming from under the wing. I had already [advised ATC] and told them we had engine trouble. Ask them to stand by for further. I grabbed the QRC and started the ENGINE FIRE or ENGINE SERVER DAMAGE or SEPARATION check list. We did not have fire indications in the cockpit but with the shaking and reports of sparks and flames from under the wing I thought that the appropriate plan of action. I performed the checklist and First Officer flew the aircraft. We completed the first (few) steps on the QRC with in 2 minutes of the realization we had a major engine problem. After we had engine shut down I told ATC we needed lower that we had lost an engine and would get back with flight vitals. ATC told us we had ZZZ behind us we had a military base to our left and ZZZ1 straight ahead and asked out intentions. I quickly talk over with First Officer ZZZ was behind and about a thirty-minute spiral down to an unfamiliar military base; so decision was made for take straight in to ZZZ1. I completed the check list in QRH while First Officer flew and do normal radio. I coordinated with the flight attendants we had shut down the morning #1 engine we had [advised ATC] and that we were going to make a single engine landing in ZZZ1. I told them I would get back with the as far as the time to ETA and that we were not expecting an evacuation; I also told them I would make an announcement to the passengers shortly. I told ATC that we wanted the longest runway and to have safety vehicles to meet the aircraft at the runway about mid field. First Officer and I briefed the approach for Runway XX ZZZ1. We used a 1;000 fpm descent to allow descent rate with minimal power to maintain safe airspeed get the aircraft to 12;000 ft. about 20 miles from ZZZ1. I told First Officer I hope he didn't mind but I felt more comfortable landing the aircraft (this had no bearing on his ability his performance was stellar). At 12;000 ft. I took the aircraft and asked First Officer to verify all items on the check list were complete. We held off on the Grd Prox switch for the flaps 15 landing so we could keep out speed above 250 kts. Having First Officer verify items was to make sure this item and all others were complete; First Officer accomplished a non standard landing. I gave the cabin a 10 minute prep and a quick announcement for passengers before descending below 10;000 ft. Flew down wind slowing and descending to 3;000 ft. turned base at 12 miles. Completed a successful stable single engine landing on Runway XX ZZZ1. Stopped the aircraft at mid field. Told passengers remain seated three times. Safety equipment came to aircraft inspected entire aircraft were given the ok to taxi to gate. Safety equipment followed us to the gate without incident. In closing Cabin crew maintained professional calm attitude. More than effectively conveyed situation in the cabin to the flight deck so the best information was available. First Officer was stellar in his performance was level headed. He was task orientated focused and relayed information promptly and succinctly. He made sure I had all the information I needed to make decisions. This entire crew should receive recognitions for their duties preformed during this in flight emergency.,B737 flight crew reported an engine failure in cruise that resulted in a single engine landing at the destination airport.

Captain's leg. AML (Maintenance Log) Review showed aircraft had just had an engine change. On takeoff; noticed odor/ fumes. As climbing out it became stronger. Cabin crew called to say they had odor/ fumes in the cabin. I assumed Pilot Flying duties while Captain coordinated with Cabin; OPS; and ATC. [ATC was notified of the situation]; CFR (crash; fire; rescue) notified. As flight progressed; odor/ fumes became less pronounced. Landed on XX; CFR said no heat signatures; followed us to gate. Normal deplaning. Cause: Engine change. Mechanic that met us said Maintenance was supposed to have done a high power run up- not sure if it was completed. Suggestions: Ensure aircraft is airworthy after major maintenance.,B737-800 First Officer reported an air return due to a fume event during initial climb.

We leveled off at FL280; I gave controls of aircraft to [the] First Officer and called Dispatch/Maintenance. I was told there was a previous write up; but were not able to duplicate. After consulting with both it was determined to return to ZZZ. An overweight landing was performed approximately 3;400 lbs over and touchdown was less than 200 FPM. Upon reaching gate Maintenance came aboard and at that point I was informed for the first time that apparently some blades were changed not sure if maybe some residual oil/grease might have been left and got into the system? I was surprised that Maintenance Control Center didn't know that maintenance had been done on that day.,A320 Captain reported an air return due to a fume event during initial climb.

During final approach due to high task loading; there was possible momentarily flap limit over speed. Landed without further incidence and priority handling was canceled. Airbus warning system did not indicate this and there was no paper limit report produced. The potential flap limit over speed was put in the AML (maintenance log).,A330 flight crew reported executing an air return due to a fume event during initial climb.

I used the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) and completed the checklist for the malfunction; isolating the pump. Shortly after that; we noticed that the quantity indication was decreasing; and stabilized at 20%. We recognized that as a leak in the pump itself; or possibly the lines to the pump; and considered that the primary cause for the failure. As such; and given that the electric pump was operational and no other system degradation was noticed; we continued to ZZZ. We monitored the hydraulic page; and noticed that the quantity was further decreasing; at a rate of 1% every ten to fifteen minutes. We calculated that we'd land with 8% to 10%.During this time (from occurrence to top of descent); we coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The decision to continue was supported. At the top of descent (almost immediately after starting down); the Master Caution illuminated again; this time with a 'LOW PRESSURE' light above the B system Engine Driven Hydraulic Pump. I delegated flying and radios to the FO; who was the Pilot Flying for the leg; and ran the same checklist as before. With the B system pump isolated; we noticed the quantity decreasing (initially 106%; now 80%.) It stabilized at 80% and didn't further decrease. After running the checklist; I told the FO that with two system failures that weren't at all typical; I would like to proceed direct to ZZZ. He agreed; and I did so with Approach.We were approximately 75 miles from the airport. I sent a message to Dispatch and Maintenance Control explaining the new problem. I called the Purser and told her what was happening; and discussed the [briefing] items. I told her that no cabin preparation was necessary and that we'd land in about 25 minutes. We concluded; and I made a PA to the passengers. I told them that we had a hydraulic problem; that the airplane was flying normally; but that as a cautionary measure we would be followed in by fire trucks after landing all the way to the gate; and that it was not something with which to be concerned.We got vectored for a right base and landed with no incident. On rollout; the A system quantity went to zero; and then restabilized at 12%. Nosewheel steering was normal; and braking action was normal. I elected to taxi clear of the runway and proceed to the gate with no further assistance. We ran the Parking Checklist and debriefed the flight; then per Gate Message; ran the Terminating Checklist. By that time; maintenance technicians were already inspecting the airplane. We could only see the left engine; and there was a large puddle of fluid underneath it.,B737NG Flight Crew reported continuing to destination with a low pressure caution on the A system hydraulics; and as they approached destination; a low pressure caution on the B system hydraulics.

We were to depart at XB:16 the next morning. The ambient temp at XA:15 when we arrived at the jet was -10 with a wind chill of -30.  During engine start the oil clog ECAM messages displayed momentary for both engines due to the extreme cold. Both FO (First Officer) and myself discussed the warm up of the engines. FO was the pilot flying the leg and the flight was non-eventful during cruise. There was a front approaching ZZZ and Dispatch was keeping us informed of the weather. I spoke to Dispatch inflight and we agreed to add ZZZ2 as an alternate due to the line of weather that was to the east of the field.  When we checked in with ATC we were told to expect holding on the [name] arrival at ZZZZZ at FL200. FO entered the hold and at this point the weather was between us and the field below our altitude. Since the descent would be around weather I called the flight attendants and had them prepare the cabin for landing and to remain seated for the remainder of the flight. After one turn in holding; at FL200; ATC told us we were going to be vectored to an arrival to the east of the field due to weather. As we started our descent; on a vectored heading; I started to smell a 'musty sock' odor.  I looked at FO and asked if he was smelling the same thing. He said yes and we both put on our O2 masks. I made a quick call to the back to check on the flight attendants. The number one said he didn't smell anything and the FAs (flight attendants) in the back said that she did smell 'some sort of odor'. I remember thinking to myself that I was starting to feel the same hypoxic symptoms I felt during Air Force altitude training. FO and myself assessed each other and we were both feeling much better with O2. At this point we were in a descent; on vectors; going to the east of the field for weather. I decided to notify ATC due to the fumes and not knowing if the cockpit would remain clear of haze because the onset of the fumes was so rapid. ATC quickly gave us vectors to runway XX in ZZZ. We stayed on O2 for the reminder of the flight. After landing and clearing the runway; I turned the aircraft bleeds and packs off. EMT and fire department personal checked passengers as they exited the aircraft. Cause: As I stated above the engines were cold soaked on startup. This odor has been linked to oil and oil seals in the engine and packs. Maybe the first real thrust reduction exposed a gap in one of the oil seals. Suggestions: This type of odor is associated with tricresylphosphate (TCP). When we landed Maintenance told us that the only way to test the aircraft was to start the engine on the ground and then smell for the TCP 'musty sock' odor. I find it unbelievable in a fume event like this that there isn't a procedure to take a swab of the cockpit or cabin to detect the presence of TCP; compound that would easily be found. There has to be residue left behind in the cockpit. When I went home I shower and scrubbed myself clean.,A320 flight crew reported a fume event during initial approach resulted in the crew donning oxygen masks and continuing to destination.

Certain things should not be rushed and there should be no shortcuts.  It is mine boggling to me that this occurred twice in a 24 hour span in the same aircraft. That is completely unacceptable and this issue and needs to be looked into.Descending on the arrival into ZZZ;we were given descend and maintain 2;000 ft. Around 4;000 ft. I heard a 'clicking noise' which sounded like an electrical component or contactor opening or closing behind the Captain's seat and an ECAM message shortly after confirming we had a GEN2 failure. The noise is what I hear when a generator comes on line after starting an engine or the APU. Shortly after we heard another 'clicking noise' and generator 1 failed as well. The aircraft then entered the ELEC EMERGENCY CONFIGURATION. We were left with only the RAT (Ram Air Turbine) and the electrical and hydraulic components associated. This occurred on a downwind to Runway ZZL in visual conditions. Due to the nature of the emergency and the phase of flight we [Requested Priority Handling] and asked for an immediate visual approach to Runway XXL. We weren't sure if there was an electrical fire or what the nature of the emergency was. We agreed to land ASAP as per the ECAM. We confirmed the gear was down and didn't have enough time to fully run through the ECAM or COM procedures. After landing safely the aircraft was met by fire trucks and we were eventually towed to the gate in ZZZ safely. It was brought to our attention after arriving that this was the second occurrence in 24 hours with this aircraft. Maintenance simply wanted to do a 'reset' and an engine run up and see if they could duplicate the issue and release the aircraft back into service just as they did yesterday. Our Contract Maintenance Mechanic in ZZZ didn't feel comfortable with that and politely refused saying this aircraft needs a more thorough check of the electrical system. Something is causing this issue with the electrical system and it needs to be addressed immediately. There is no reason this aircraft should be returned to service until we know what is causing the issue and it is addressed appropriately.On a side note we were also given the wrong logbook in ZZZ1 before the flight. Fortunately we caught the mistake and were issued the correct logbook. I think there needs to be a little more sense of urgency within our Maintenance department. We got an apology from the Mechanic; but if we had not caught the mistake we'd have been in a bad situation after an emergency and we don't even have the correct log book. Once in ZZZ; The Maintenance Controller only seemed concerned about getting an aircraft returned to service as soon as possible to prevent delays and cancellations. This was obviously the same behavior the previous night in ZZZ1. This isn't a simple deferral or something that should just be brushed under the rug. If you are losing both engine generators within seconds of each other; that isn't a fluke. With both engines running normal; this shouldn't happen in an aircraft with a properly working electrical system.  This is a serious matter and needs to be addressed immediately.,Flight Crew flying A319 aircraft encountered electrical failure in descent.

The Main Gear showed UP indication but the Nose Gear indicated in transit (white crosshatch indication). There was loud buffeting noise that also indicated probably Nose Gear in transit. We advised ATC of the malfunction and requested holding at 10000 ft. They advised that traffic was light and that they would provide vectors instead of holding. We followed FOM CRM technique for emergency situations. The First Officer was Pilot Flying and handled routine ATC communications. I as Captain handled checklists and all other communication with Flight Attendants; passengers; Dispatch and Maintenance. I made a PA announcement to explain the noise and contacted the Purser via interphone to advise her we were working checklists and would most likely be returning. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance using SATCOM. I described the malfunction and requested if Maintenance had any other information about this type of gear malfunction. I advised them per GEAR DISAGREE checklist the landing gear would be extended using the alternate gear extension. The GEAR DISAGREE checklist was completed. The First Officer and I discussed landing performance and discussed fuel dumping versus overweight landing. We determined that our landing weight would be 447;000 lbs. which would be 2000 lbs. overweight. Landing performance data was evaluated and was well within safe parameters.Dispatch was advised of return and overweight landing. I advised ATC since this was a non-normal situation and our workload was increased. All checklists were completed and passengers; Flight Attendants were notified of return to [departure airport]. I advised the Purser that a normal landing was planned with taxi to gate. We landed  and exited at a taxiway so that ARFF could inspect [the] nose gear area. They advised [that the] area looked normal. I advised them no further assistance was required. We taxied to [the] gate and parked.,B777 Captain reported they had an unsafe gear indication; returned to the airport and performed an overweight landing.

We got an autofail light on the pressurization panel. I immediately grabbed the QRH to reference the emergency procedure. We started running the checklist. We had an autofail light with an uncontrollable cabin altitude. We then asked ATC for a lower altitude; but were not allowed to descend. The QRH directed us to go to alternate on the pressurization panel. We then selected alternate (ALTN). At this point the autofail light was still illuminated and the cabin altitude was uncontrollable. The QRH then says to go to manual mode and to manually open and close the valve as needed to control the cabin altitude. The Captain then began controlling the cabin manually with the toggle selector. He pressed the manual switch slightly and I started to see the differential pressure climb into the caution range and moving toward the max differential limit. I then heard the Captain say oxygen masks on and 100 percent. After I donned the mask I looked up and saw that we had exceeded max differential pressure. We established communication and checked that the seatbelt sign was on. The Captain kept running the checklist and I notified ATC that we needed a lower altitude immediately. ATC allowed us to descend to 36000 feet initially and then 32000 feet. I initiated an emergency descent and I continued to ask for lower altitudes and after consulting with the Captain I [notified ATC] for a pressurization problem. I asked for 10;000 feet and asked to divert. Meanwhile the Captain worked through the autofail checklist and had moved to the rapid depressurization and emergency descent checklist. The Captain was also communicating to the flight attendants; passengers and was attempting to contact Dispatch. After getting things stabilized the Captain and I came back together as a team to communicate what had been completed by each of us; so that we both could gain situational awareness of what had transpired. He told me that he had completed the checklist down to the deferred items and I told him that I had the airplane set up to land and was ready to brief him for the landing whenever he was caught up. We then briefed and continued uneventfully. After landing the mechanic verified that the primary and alternate pressurization controller were not working and he was suspicious that the manual mode wasn't working correctly. We did not receive the final diagnosis before leaving the aircraft. The Captain and I debriefed the flight and determined the following. Communication with the masks on made it challenging; but we were able to work through it. We did a good job of dividing duties to make sure that the airplane was being flown; checklists were being completed and situational awareness remained high. I would attribute this to our CRM training program.,A Flight Crew reported loss of pressurization in the cockpit requiring an emergency descent and diversion to the nearest suitable airport.

No service due to turbulence. The forward lav was locked so the A and D [flight attendants] came to back to use the lav towards the end of flight. They noticed strange smell in the aft right lav. We all put our heads in to smell it and try to determine the cause. As we were deplaning we told Captain and he called Supervisor down and advised us to follow procedure for air quality. We all experienced different symptoms. I felt light headed; headache; and confusion. We went to Supervisor's office and called Global Health. We then went to the emergency room and had blood drawn; vitals taken; and put on oxygen for long time. My blood work came back at level 3 for carbon monoxide; which is high. We then were cleared from the emergency room and went to hotel for the night. No more information.,B737-700 flight attendants reported a fumes event during deplaning resulting in health issues.

'Vomiting; and in-and-out of consciousness; and nauseous'. Male; 60 years-old was also suffering from COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder). There were three Doctors onboard tending to the ill Passenger. As the Pilot Flying; I handed control over to the FO (First Officer); and contacted STAT-MD. The FAs headset was not working very well; compounding the issue; so I became the go between. STAT-MD suggested we 'lay the Passenger down; head resting; feet elevated 10 inches'. STAT-MD made the recommendation to leave the ill Passenger on the floor; in this condition; for 30 to 45 minutes. If there is no change to his condition; to call STAT-MD back. I relayed this to the FAs and disconnected with STAT-MD.The three Doctors on board disagreed with STAT-MDs recommendation; and said we need to land; 'NOW'. I was 100 percent going to take the advise of Doctors ONBOARD over STAT-MD. I reconvened as the Pilot Flying; and we came to the decision to divert to ZZZ. Since the EMK (Emergency Medical Kit) would be used; and the landing would be overweight (145;300 pounds); Maintenance would need to be involved. A diversion plan was made by Dispatch; and we [advised ATC]. Center cleared us directly to ZZZZZ on the Arrival; landing west. Things got busy; real busy. I began an; expeditious; descent to get on the VNAV PATH. Only about 80 miles from ZZZ when we began our turn for the arrival. My FO picked up ATIS and ran the numbers for XXL and XXR; including a look at the Brake Cooling module. We then briefed the arrival and approach. As we got lower we kept getting turned in on the arrival; which I was okay with. I admit; I was a bit in the Yellow for awhile. We were below 10;000 ft. when we finally got around to running the Descent; Approach; and Diversion Checklists. I extended the gear early; to help lighten our weight by as much as I could. The approach was made to Runway XXR. The; soft; landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway; and right into the ramp. The FO contacted Ramp; Ops; and Maintenance. Once in the gate; I left the seat belt sign on and made a PA to the Passengers to remain seated. The EMTs quickly deplaned the ill Passenger and left. As soon as the boarding door was open; the Parking Checklist complete; and I turned on my phone; I was barraged; to say the least. I called Dispatch and spoke with him; the Chief Pilot on Call; Ground Ops; and Maintenance. I didn't even have time to debrief with my Crew. Once I was able to talk to the FAs it was made aware to me that an IV had been administered to the ill Passenger. It ran out as we touched down. The FAs said the ill Passenger's condition IMMEDIATELY deteriorated again. Further justifying our decision to divert. I feel I made the best decision I could; considering the circumstance and utilized all necessary resources to reach the desired outcome. A job well done by my Cabin Crew; and my FO. I also think a stellar job was made by Ops and Maintenance to get the aircraft on its way again.,B738 Captain reported a medical diversion.

He explained that during the initial climb out from ZZZ1; all the flight attendants smelled a musty; moldy; stinky sock smell. He never informed us of this issue until we were talking at the gate in ZZZ. Flight Attendant went on to explain that soon after I signaled the flight attendants that we were passing through 10;000 ft. and I made my 'Flight attendants; prepare for landing' PA; the musty; moldy; stinky sock smell returned but; stronger this time. He said passengers were closing their air vents; and covering their noses with articles of their clothing etc. He said he didn't call me due to the sterile cockpit rule. All the flight attendants agreed that the smell lasted until reaching the gate. After confirming the same story with every flight attendant; I called Maintenance; entered it into the AML; and filled out the fumes report for Maintenance. The airport sent [paramedics] to the gate area and every crew member was checked. The main common factor seemed to be high blood pressure. The top number was over 200 for four of the flight attendants and the [paramedics] transported that four to a local hospital for additional tests and observation. I made sure each flight attendant had a buddy or someone that would stay with them. My symptoms were headaches and my blood pressure slightly higher than normal; extremely tired following the event.,"A330 flight crew reported they were notified post flight by a Flight Attendant of a stinky sock"" smell during climbout.

Fumes and very slight haze around Captains side window; a smell of engine coking (burning oil or electronics smell). 15-20 minutes after departure I turned to my First Officer and asked if he smelled anything. He did not. We continued; the smell persisted and about 1.5 hrs into the flight I began to become very bothered by the smell. I felt like I needed fresh air and decided to begin breathing out of my O2 mask. I began to feel physical issues; like shortness of breath and a little dizzy and thinking about needing to throw up. After a few minutes I got out of my seat for a restroom break and to determine if the smell was in the cabin. It was not. While I was in the restroom the A Flight Attendant came up and sat in my seat. She complained of the smell to the First Officer. He went to check it out and realized it was on my side but not his. I came back from the restroom and at this point it became clear to us that there was definitely a smell on just my side. We ran the QRH and then talked to Dispatch and Maintenance. We used the masks and [advised ATC]; then headed for ZZZ.,"A320 Captain reported a burning oil or electronics"" smell during cruise that resulted in a diversion."""

This caused severe damage to the fuselage. Main causes were probable fatigue; poor weather; and deferred items. The crew's duty day was extended the full two hours allowed due to passenger compliance complications in ZZZ. The weather was worse than forecast or originally reported; the worst winds reported by Tower were approximately 260 deg at 25G35. The deferred auto speedbrakes were very probably a contributing factor to the initial bounce; which led to two other porpoising bounces. Our scheduled duty day comprised of two; 5-hour flights with a 2-hour refueling stop in between. A schedule like this provides for very little sleeping breaks for the augmented crew; much less than a single long flight would allow. The use of duty time extensions on top of an already-long day should also be explored. Training involving a more thorough understanding of the effects of speedbrakes; particularly for heavy category aircraft; could be very beneficial going forward.,B767-300ER pilot crew reported damage to aircraft during landing due to inoperative aircraft systems; pilot fatigue and windy conditions.

The smell was not noticeable on the flight deck or at other locations in the cabin; and no passengers were expressing any concerns or discomfort. First Officer stepped back to verify and reported it as a petroleum type smell. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via radio. There wasn't any noticeable fuel loss or fuel burn.  As a precaution we placed the Pack into High Flow; [advised ATC]; and proceeded to ZZZ (closest suitable airfield). We reviewed the smoke/fumes checklist as a precaution in case the fumes became perceptible on the flight deck (it never did). Pilot Flying donned the O2 as a precaution only. Flight attendants were instructed to review cabin prep/evac procedures but not the prep the cabin. Passengers were not informed of anything unusual/abnormal.We executed a day VMC landing at ZZZ with approach control ATC guidance. We cleared the runway and proceeded to the gate with [Crash Fire Rescue] following.,A319 Captain reported a fumes event during cruise that resulted in a diversion.

Ran the QRH for both checklists. Contacted dispatch and was told to continue to ZZZ1. Asked for Dispatch to include [Maintenance] in discussion. While waiting for them to get back to us; the FO and I determined the best course of action was to return to ZZZ due to weather and terrain . We advised ATC and started back towards ZZZ. I briefed the flight attendants without preparing the cabin for evacuation. On approach FO continued to fly while I assisted with manual trim. Normal landing and taxied to gate to debrief with Maintenance. After talking with ZZZ [Chief Pilot] elected to discontinue the rest of our flying for the day.,B737 Captain reported an air return due to a runaway trim and speed trim failure.

He made an all call. The 2 and 4 [flight attendants] smelled something and stated they felt dizzy. They stated they all had headaches; which I said I also had gotten since we took off. I recognized the scent as something from the chemicals that maintenances uses on the aircraft on the ground; like deicing in the engines or a chemical burning off. The captain stated they were also smelling it in the cockpit. The Captain stated we'd be going back to ZZZ at that point. No passengers complained until arriving in ZZZ (they were both crew members dead heading; which noticed and recognized the original scent). Upon final descent and after preparation for landing; while strapped in my jumpseat; my throat started to feel like it was getting very irritated and scratchy. I also started to feel very light headed and dizzy; almost lethargic. My headache remained and increased in intensity. We landed and de-planed. Management met the flight; but we continued to be on the aircraft. As I did my final walk through; I notice the odor/fumes were extremely strong between the 3 LR and 4 LR doors. They burned my throat and caused me to feel like I wanted to cough. Catering came to 4L and opened the door; which dissipated the odor/fumes in the cabin. The crew de-plane the aircraft. We were escorted to Operations where we calls the on call nurse; Who referred us to an emergency room. Myself and the three other flight attendants receive treatment in the emergency room and were released. Suggestions: There should be a set protocol for an immediate lab test for specific blood gasses; levels of certain chemicals and toxins. We were stalled and left in the fumes with deplaning and calling unnecessary nurses when we were seeking treatment no matter what. The Airbus needs an investigation on these fume/odor events. This was my first and it was extremely frightening. I felt like I was almost having decompression symptoms with the light headedness.,A321 Flight Attendant reported a cabin fumes event during initial climb resulting in health issues.

Right after that Flight Attendant called to report a strong burning smell. I asked if anything was in the ovens and she replied no and she would investigate and call back. Shortly she called and said the smell could not be identified but appeared to be coming from the air ducts. First Officer and I discussed it briefly and I advised her we would return for landing with 10 minutes remaining in flight and a normal landing. First Officer continued as flying pilot with autopilot engaged and managed programming the FMC for a return to ZZZ. I ran the smoke fire fumes checklist; used ACARS for sending the divert message; and continued communication with ATC including [requesting priority handling]. While running the checklist we decided the oxygen masks were not needed. Then we completed the normal checklists. I made a brief PA to the passengers. We noticed the off-schedule descent light and noted we were returning to the departure field taking no further action on that light with consideration of being on approach. I asked if First Officer was good to continue as flying pilot through the landing and he completed a nice landing.,B737 flight crew reported that a fumes event during climb resulted in a return to the departure airport.

We suspected pressurization and noticed cabin climbing slowly at 500 fpm. Cabin did not stabilize and was just over 9000 feet. We decided to start a normal but rapid descent to a lower cruise altitude. We got the Cabin Altitude aural alert and warning light during the descent. Accomplished QRC/QRH; which required an emergency descent and deployment of cabin O2 masks. Notified ATC and got clearance to 14;000 feet. Passing about FL230 we noticed cabin was below 9000 feet and stable. We stopped descent at FL210 and diverted to ZZZ. Checked with F/As (Flight Attendants) to make sure there were no injuries and to advise that they and passengers could remove O2 masks. The rest of flight was uneventful. Preventative Measures: F/O suggested that we start down as soon as we saw the cabin climbing after the thumps. I wanted to see if cabin would stabilize since the rate was slow. If we started down earlier; we may have avoided the emergency descent/masks since the cabin stabilized at FL230.,B737-700 flight crew reported an uneventful emergency descent & diversion due to a loss of pressurization during cruise.

Noticed right engine oil quantity indicated 4 qts. Went to QRH and followed procedure. Oil pressure and temperature indications were normal and pretty much matched the left engine. Continued to monitor as directed. Called dispatch on crew phone ( which worked great BTW) and gave him a heads up. Agreed that we would continue with diverts ahead of ZZZ; ZZZ1 and ZZZ2. Quantity indication continued to decrease slowly over the next hour. Pressure and temperature were normal. Approximately abeam ZZZ1 we asked to descend to FL 300 due to turbulence. At idle power; oil pressure and temperature remained normal and basically matched the left engine. However; at level off when power was increased; we noticed that the right engine oil pressure began to noticeably fluctuate and decrease. We immediately [advised] with ATC and began a diversion to ZZZ2. With right oil pressure at or near the red line limit; we elected to shut down the engine. Complied with QRH procedures and executed an ILS/visual single engine approach to RWY 26. ARRF was standing by. We cleared the runway and stopped on the parallel taxiway. ARRF crew checked out the right engine and advised that there were no issues. They followed us to gate A-9. Maintenance met us at the gate and were debriefed.,B737 Captain reported decreasing oil quantity on right engine at cruise with subsequent fluctuating pressure and quantity resulting in an inflight engine shutdown and diversion to make an priority landing.

I confirmed that no smoke was actually present just the smell.  We adjusted the packs cooler and the smell dissipated. We had [Runway] XXL in the FMS and received a change to [Runway] XXC. While trying to load [Runway] XXC into the box we found that both FMSs would only show [Runway] XXL and no other approaches would populate on the arrival page. We then received another call from the cabin reporting that the burning smell was back but no smoke present. With the ISFD having quit; the FMS anomaly suddenly present; and more burning smell present; began to think we had a melt down of some sort going on in the E & E compartment. [Advised ATC] stating we wanted [Runway] XXL since we couldn't as yet make out the field through the scattered clouds below us and couldn't select any other approach. Fire trucks gave us a once over and followed us to the gate. Kept the flaps at 40 just in case an evac was necessary if smoke began to fill the cabin. Burning smell persisted on the ground to the gate but no smoke was present. Had pulled the Smoke; Fire; Fumes Checklist out but I decided the most prudent and efficient act was to land ASAP and elected not to execute this checklist while on an accelerated final approach with no smoke present in the cabin. No FA or passenger needed medical attention. We never smelled smoke or a burning smell in the cockpit.Post flight maintenance found a bad light ballast in the vicinity of rows 10-13.  The ISFD failure and FMS anomaly were apparently unrelated but had occurred rather simultaneously.With more time; say if we'd been at altitude; the Smoke; Fire; Fumes checklist could have isolated the problem and may not have led to the interpretation of a more serious situation possibly developing.,B737 Captain reported a cockpit display failure with an unrelated simultaneous cabin lighting ballast failure resulting in a precautionary landing due to suspected electrical fire.

On the landing rollout we had an electrical anomaly that caused several of the primary displays to go blank. Upper EICAS; CA (Captain) PFD; MFD; FMS; And FO (First Officer) PFD. This was subsequently followed by a strong electrical burning smell. This was entered into the logbook with a few other discrepancies. We reported later that afternoon to operate Aircraft X as different flight number from ZZZ-ZZZ2. Local Maintenance said they have been troubleshooting this issue all day and believed it to be a screen overheat caused by a faulty pack valve. The logbook was signed off and we blocked out to taxi for takeoff of Runway XX. On takeoff around 400 feet the screens again went blank. We continued flying using the standby instruments. We indicated to Tower we needed to return and she handed us off to Departure to be vectored for an approach; the weather was OVC008. We notified ATC with departure and was vectored back around for the ILS XY. After landing the Fire Marshal entered the cockpit and indicated he smelled an electrical burning smell. This was once again entered into the logbook as a repeat item.,B767 flight crew reported an air turn back after maintenance failed to repair failed cockpit displays and the problem reoccurred on takeoff resulting in a return to departure airport.

Passenger had become unconscious and unresponsive in the forward lavatory and CPR/AED efforts were being administered. Between ZZZ2 & ZZZ airports; medical personnel onboard advised us to land as soon as possible in the hopes of resuscitating the passenger. We therefore expedited to ZZZ airport from our cruising altitude of 36;000' to include exceeding the 250 knot below 10;000' FAR airspeed restriction in the descent to the airport area. This was done under Captain's emergency authority due to the medical emergency onboard. The conditions were VFR and with minimal traffic in the airspace; the risk was deemed to be very low.,A321 pilot crew reported using pilot emergency authority below 10;000 feet; increased speed; for critically ill passenger.

En route climbing out of 14;500 ft.; we heard a bang and slight yaw motion of the aircraft. We noticed #2 engine had failed. The Captain stated 'I have the aircraft'; assumed control of the aircraft and disconnected the auto pilot and auto throttles. He directed me to inform ATC of our engine failure and request a return to ZZZ; our nearest suitable airport. He then asked for the QRC for Engine Fire/Engine Severe Damage or Separation Checklist. We performed the Challenge; Response; Response Checklist along with QRH and non-normal items. We [advised ATC] and requested to have CFR (Crash Fire rescue) on standby at the airport.The Captain then informed the flight attendants and the passengers of the situation and that we would return to ZZZ. I ran the appropriate checklist and non-normal items. We requested delay vectors as we prepared to return to field. After completing our QRH and non-normal procedures; we had an uneventful single engine landing in VMC conditions. After clearing the runway; we were instructed by ATC to hold position and contact CFR on a discreet frequency. The Captain made a PA to the passengers and informed the flight attendants that we had no adverse indications in the cockpit. CFR asked for what assistance we requested. We had them assess the outside [of] #2 engine for any damage or fire condition. They assessed and gave us the all clear. We proceeded back to the terminal and parked the aircraft. No passenger stated anything other than 'good job' and 'thanks for getting us back safely.',B737 flight crew reported an engine failure during climb that resulted in a precautionary landing.

The auto throttles kicked off and then we noticed the #2 engine N1 gauge started to decrease. The Captain lowered the nose of the airplane and held that altitude and asked me to [advise ATC] which I did. I ran the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist. Item#14 ask if you want to try a restart. After talking it over with the Captain we decide to give it a try. I then ran the Eng Start - Inflight check list. The result was unsuccessful. We then received a clearance from ATC for the ILS Runway XX. After we landed we had the emergency vehicles inspect the aircraft. They told us nothing was seen except that the engine was shut down; and then we taxied to the gate.,Flight Crew reported an inflight engine shutdown; causing an air turnback and landing.

The ovens were not on. In conversation with purser; we were trying to decide about whether we should continue or return. Got another call from cabin and was told that there was another pilot onboard that said that he 'was concerned;' and that passengers were asking. After hearing that key word; made the decision to return to ZZZ. Advised flight attendants and made a PA to passengers. Notified ATC. Accomplished the cabin smoke/fire/fumes checklist. Exceeded 250 kts; to expedite return. Landed XXR and cleared at golf. Inspected exterior by Crash Fire Rescue; and cleared to gate.  When door opened ground personnel could smell strange odor.  Advised that they were considering odor came from electro-static sprayer. One of the flight attendants later said she smelled the same thing yesterday.,B737 flight crew reported a cabin fumes event during takeoff resulting in a return to the departure airport.

The flight attendants called and informed us of the same noise. Within 30 seconds of their call the number 1 engine started to spool down and finally indicated an engine failure. I notified ATC and briefed the flight attendants and passengers of the situation. The weather at ZZZ was reporting thunderstorms and gusty winds so we decided to divert to ZZZ1 where the weather was clear with light winds. We ran all the checklist and briefed flight attendants and passengers of the diversion to ZZZ1. We continued without anymore problems and landed safely in ZZZ1. We were followed to the gate by fire and rescue in case we needed any further assistance. After parking at the gate Maintenance was briefed of the event and the passengers were deplaned.,Captain reported an uncommanded inflight engine shutdown after compressor stalls; causing a diversion and emergency landing.

Because there was very little wind. Some of this smoke entered the aircraft before we finished starting the #1 engine. Other than a slightly odd smell; it seemed to disperse quickly.  I verbalized this to the pushback crew and the First Officer. Additionally; I mentioned to the FO (First Officer) that I would call the flight attendants and make an announcement over the PA. Before taxiing; the F/A's (Flight Attendants) called to report the smell and that there was some possibility of smoke or haze in the cabin. I communicated through the F/O that we would check back with them after we taxied a ways to see if it was improving or getting worse. I also made a PA to the passengers.  At this time I believed the problem was that we had ingested exhaust fumes from the engine start. After taxiing for about four minutes; I checked back with the F/A's and the front two could neither see nor smell anything. The back two said they could still smell something; but not see anything.  They also stated that it was not getting better; but neither was it getting worse. I discussed the situation with the F/O and he felt there was no reason not to go; but thought one more check with the F/A's might help.  Since we just talked to them and they were alright with going; I elected to continue. We executed a normal takeoff and upon approaching the cleanup altitude; the odd smell returned and I stated that this was something that required us to return to ZZZ. Simultaneously; the F/A's also reported the smoke and fumes had returned. I am not sure of the precise order of events; but we donned our oxygen masks; notified ATC; and requested a return to the airport.With our masks on; the F/O and I struggled to communicate with each other and ATC. Basically the design shoots so much oxygen into the mask that it overpowers the microphone inside it.  We both operated the mask correctly and spent some effort and time verifying the settings; but nothing worked. For this reason; I elected to make a relatively quick return to the airfield. In all my experience (43 years); I have never had a problem like this with a mask.  I asked Maintenance Control if I should write both masks up and said no because they frequently get complaints like this. We flew a box pattern and made an uneventful landing with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) truck giving us a good check out.  After coordinating with the company and flight attendants and briefing the passengers; we taxied to the gate. During the taxi we did not experience anymore smoke and fumes. Maintenance technicians checked the aircraft out; informed us that the 'B' system hydraulic system was over serviced and had entered in the ventilation system where it produced the smoke and fumes. Continued flying would not have improved our situation; so I was glad we made a prompt return. I think the decision to take the aircraft flying was not good in retrospect; but all of us thought there was no reason; at the time; to not go flying.  I have had similar situations just like this and the problem went away once there was sufficient air moving through the cabin. Looking back; even though there was contradictory inputs from the F/A's; there was still enough to warrant a return to gate. The problems with O2 masks is unacceptable.  Maybe they would have worked better at higher altitudes (we only climbed to 6000 ft); but it made the flight deck workload very high and challenging.,Flight Crew flying 737-800 aircraft encountered smoke and fumes in cabin after takeoff.

As we were descending from cruise and deviating around enroute weather; we were in the clear deviating far from any cells; we started hearing a repetitive muffled pounding sound that seemed like the flight attendants banging on a cart; or a sound along those lines. It wasn't too loud as to startle us; but strange. I looked at our engine instruments and all seemed normal at that point as our power was reduced for the descent. There was no great adverse yaw due to little power and the autopilot being on. Shortly after hearing the noise and asking each other what that could be; the flight attendants called up and reported a banging noise coming from the number one engine.  We could feel very tiny vibrations. I looked at the gauges and remember seeing both N1's in the 40% range; with no engine limits exceeded. I increased power on both engines; and sure enough; I got no response from the number one engine. It appeared to just be windmilling or providing idle power possibly.After confirming the power loss while on the interphone with the flight attendants; we [advised ATC] due to an engine failure; and we were given direct routing. Pilot Monitoring ran the appropriate checklist which led to shutting down and securing the number one engine as the EGT was high and we felt some minor vibrations. Just before completely shutting the engine down; the ENG FAIL light did eventually illuminate. The Pilot Monitoring answered repeated questions with ATC and since we were in a descent; things were moving fast. There we lots of cells out there I had to deviate around. I focused on flying the airplane and keeping control. I was able to leave the autopilot engaged and trimmed the aircraft as appropriate. ATC came back and said there was a thunderstorm building on the field that was not moving away.  As we got closer; we had ATC ask the tower the current conditions and the status on that thunderstorm cell. Since it hadn't moved; winds were increasing; and possibly having to go IMC to land in the Pilot Monitoring after discussing it with me; requested a diversion to an airport where the sky was clear; winds light; a long runway; and no weather in sight.After completing the checklist and coordinating with ATC; at some point we changed the destination in the FMC and notified Dispatch. The passengers were also briefed of the situation both earlier about the engine failure; and later about the diversion. The flight attendants were also rebriefed about the diversion. We also requested to have emergency trucks standing by. I briefed the new approach and reviewed the engine failure profile; single engine go-around procedure again; and requested direct to a fix prior to the FAF so we could get stable. I flew the engine out profile as trained to an uneventful hand flown approach and landing. After clearing the runway; we contacted the emergency vehicle on another frequency and they confirmed everything looked normal. One of the trucks followed us to the terminal and we parked at the gate. As we opened the door; Maintenance came on board. We deadheaded to our scheduled overnight on an Airbus that was coming in about an hour to resume our trip.  The Pilot Monitoring communicated very well and great CRM throughout the whole flight.  He always asked for my inputs; as well as I did his. We had flown together several times over the years which led to good camaraderie and CRM.  I feel we worked well as a team and were well trained to complete the mission in this most stressful situation.  Both of us have extensive experience and many years flying the 737. I want to say the flight attendants did a good job calming passengers on both our flight and the flight back that we deadheaded on. At some point the Chief Pilot contacted the Captain.,B737 pilot reported diverting due to an engine failure.

After approximately two to three minutes the right oil quantity reached zero. We then received an ECAM Warning for 'ENG 2 OIL LOW PR (in red)'.  We followed SOP and performed the ECAM procedure; which directed us to shut down the right engine.  We [advised ATC]Center and requested a return to our departure airport. I notified Dispatch of our engine shutdown and our diversion. I performed a single engine approach. We landed without further incident. Oil leak in the right engine,A319 pilot reported an oil leak on departure caused them to shut down an engine and return for a landing.

About 15-20 seconds later the engine initiated a successful auto relight. The engine operated normally for the remainder of the flight. I requested priority handling with ATC (Air Traffic Control). I was concerned that the engine might eventually fail and elected to divert into ZZZ1. We decided to land with Flaps 15 for performance considerations should the engine fail on final approach. We also elected to hold for a couple of circuits to get setup for the approach into ZZZ1 and to get our before landing checklist completed. Passengers and flight attendants were briefed during the hold. We told ATC that we would be stopping on the runway so that ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) could inspect our #1 engine before we continued to taxi to our gate. During the runway inspection aircraft maintenance conducted a visual inspection of our #1 engine while at idle and recommended we shut it down due to abnormal surging or pulsation. Taxi to gate 12 was uneventful.,B737 Flight Crew encountered an un-commanded inflight engine shutdown that resulted in a diversion.

Until point of malfunction aircraft operated with no observed anomalies or deficiencies. Flight was smooth and routine until shortly after reaching Top of Descent and leaving FL380. Descending from FL380 to FL300 Auto Fail light illuminated on pressurization panel. Estimate the illumination of the Auto Fail light occurred around FL370. First Officer acting as Pilot Monitoring located appropriate checklist in QRH and we commenced working through the items contained therein. Completed QRH 2.4. The Auto Fail light extinguished and we continued normal operation with panel now set to ALTN mode. Shortly thereafter there was erratic behavior in the differential pressure and cabin altitude gauge. The changes were noticeable in ears as the pressure/cabin altitude changed quickly in either direction. Scanned overhead panel and noticed the ALTN light no longer illuminated. Verbalized to First Officer that we should put our masks on. At this point estimate the aircraft was between FL360 and FL300 which was the initial floor of our assigned descent from ATC.  We both donned masks and within moments the Cabin Altitude light illuminated with corresponding warning horn and a very noticeable drop in pressure. Called for and First Officer immediately secured and began with the Cabin Altitude Warning QRC. PASS OXY ON light illuminated as well indicating Cabin Oxygen masks had deployed. Accomplished Cabin Altitude Warning QRC. Cabin altitude spiked but can't recall to what altitude. At one point; cabin descended rapidly and diff pressure climbed to redline on gauge.Outflow valve seemed to be uncontrollable; which made the onboard pressurization issue uncontrollable.  Coordinated with ATC for lower altitude and maintained an expedited descent that was essentially unbroken until landing. At completion of QRC we were directed to accomplish QRH 2.1. Used 2.1 through entire descent and uneventful landing.  During descent while coordinating with cabin crew; flight attendants informed flight deck crew that one passenger briefly lost consciousness but was awake again and being attended to by cabin crew. Notified ATC of need for EMS to meet aircraft at gate upon arrival. ATC facilitated request and local EMS met aircraft and evaluated passenger.  Upon arrival coordinated with Dispatch; both local Company Maintenance and Maintenance Control and Chief Pilot; to ensure aircraft abnormalities were properly documented in logbook; crew was taken care of and all other pertinent issues had been addressed.  I think this was an anomaly and part of flying aircraft as a business. Things break. Just glad it turned out the way it did. As far as self evaluation goes; I did forget a few items that bug me. One; I should've let the First Officer handle communication with the cabin as I ended up unnecessarily task loading myself. Also; I forgot to send an ACARs to Dispatch or radio them letting them know about the situation. We were pretty busy but no excuse. I'm pretty sure ATC notified Company if only just the local ops folks. The checklist was handled correctly but as ALTN system failed and we were directed to go to manual. The cabin pressure spiked and dropped several times and then failed. That was certainly an enormous distraction and it took us a minute to get masks on and fully reengaged with the checklist. Feel like I could've done a better job leading in those moments. Will say that I was very happily surprised by how much our training kicked in; when the event got bad. Kudos to the training folks!,B737-800 flight crew reported a normal landing following the loss of pressurization at top of descent.

Prior to taxi; with parking brake set CA (Captain) called [Dispatch] for patch to [Maintenance Control] ENG. Spoke to [Maintenance] about problem. Noted CA reset EECs; with ALTN extinguished. Inquired if there was any issue with continuing. Maintenance inquired about CDS flags or other cautions. None observed; OK to continue per [Maintenance]. Normal taxi out and initial takeoff. A/T disengaged almost simultaneously with the airspeed on FO (First Officer) reaching 100 knots (about 60 knots on CA display who was PF [Pilot Flying]). After startle; then quick cross check FO called out 100 knots and that there was a problem with airspeed indications ... noting his were normal. Transfer of PF duties prior to V1 ... normal rotation and takeoff by FO. Flew out on departure and got the aircraft cleaned up and safely away from the ground. Continued climb out to get out of MOD TURB in area due to TS to allow for troubleshooting. Informed ATC of the problem and asked to stop at FL200. Overspeed clacker started and we elected to stop the climb and initiate descent to 10;000 feet to continue troubleshooting. CA as PNF (Pilot Not Flying) was distracted by the EEC issue and slow to realize the Airspeed Unreliable situation. FO and [the jumpseater] did great job in keeping ACFT in safe envelope. Turbulence and distractions from warnings and annunciations contributed to PNF not completing all QRH checklists. Hand flown ILS to VIS runway XXL after speaking with flight attendants; passengers; and ACARS message to [Dispatch] of return and EMERG. Uneventful; safe; under max weight landing on RWY XXL. Taxi to gate followed by crash and fire. CA spoke to [Operations Management] on cell at gate after completion of parking checklist. ELB entry made. Spoke to local [Maintenance] in cockpit to try to assist in troubleshooting prior to aircraft swap to next gate for continuation of flight.CA supported by a superb FO yesterday (and [the jumpseater] who we brought into help). Good CRM and communication between crew. CA needs to do a better job separating PF / PNF to allow for more focused approach to identification of the problem and completion of all appropriate checklists.

Airborne at safe altitude CA initiated the EEC (Electronic Engine Control) Alternate Mode of Checklist for some reason (EEC's had switched to alt - same had happened in ZZZ1 after the 2nd engine start and was cleared with Maintenance) although I stated we have an Unreliable Airspeed with IAS Disagree flags. -*50 % of the time Unreliable Altitude flags on the altimeter were displayed also - CA never acknowledged seeing the ALT Disagree flag*- CA wanted to climb to 16;000 feet; which I questioned. (I believe I said 'you are not really thinking about continuing all the way to ZZZ2 with this so why climb higher than needed' and he responded that he wants to get out of the bumps (moderate to severe turbulence was reported in the area due to thunderstorms - we had light turbulence for most of the climbout). We flew in MVFR to VFR mostly. I believe we leveled off at 12;000 feet and then CA notified ATC. EEC checklist was performed but I don't recall CDS (Common Display System) displaying DSPLY SOURCE. I reminded him to pull out the QRC Unreliable Airspeed checklist which was pulled out although FD (Flight Director) switches were omitted by the CA and never turned off (I should have verified this memory item) The CA never read the QRH for the Unreliable Airspeed checklist; but the person on the jumpseat did (not sure if he was delegated for the QRH reading by the CA); omitting the conditions for the checklist and some other items but catching the FD switches verifying the pitch and power settings from the QRH for '800 series. Normal arrival with delayed vectors and landing performed. The flight never exceeded any flight parameters and limitations and stayed in normal flight envelope at all times. During the flight CA airspeed varied from 330 plus activating the high speed clacker to as low as 46 activating the stall shaker making the communication at times difficult. The light turbulence associated with thunderstorms created another distraction.,B737-800 First Officer reported confusion between flight crew after auto-throttle fail on takeoff was followed by air data computer failure causing unreliable airspeed; resulting in an Air Turn Back and Landing

There was a [Malfunction A] and a [Malfunction B] that needed to be changed. There was one mechanic from swing shift at the airplane. The swings mechanic was asked which engine had [Malfunction A] and what engine had [Malfunction B]. The swing shift mechanic said [work on Malfunction B] was done and gestured towards the #2 eng - which the removed [component] was placed near the paperwork table by the # 2 eng. The #1 eng needed [Malfunction A addressed] which we were standing next to during the turnover. I assumed [Malfunction B] was on #2 eng that needed leak check. We finished up [Malfunction A] on #1 eng and pushed out plane and leaked checked #2 eng. The A/C left ZZZ and lost oil pressure on #1 eng. Then diverted to ZZZ1. Actually the #1 [component] was changed and was the eng that should have been leak checked. The write up in the log book for tracking purposes did not specify what eng it was; the job card did not specify what engine and I was going by the swing shift turnover which the mechanics that changed the [component for Malfunction B] were not present.A lack of communication between mechanics; leads; supervisors. The mechanic that performed the job was not present on what eng or what needed to be accomplished. So I assumed only leak check on #2 eng was all that was needed so we just focused on [fixing Malfunction A].Better communication; Eng clarification of Job card.,A321 Flight Crew reported a loss of oil quantity followed by loss of oil pressure causing the number 1 engine to be shut down and a diversion.

As we were in a 1000FPM descent on the arrival; we received direct ZZZ. The FMC determined we were high and throttles started moving towards the idle position. As the throttles were in transition to idle I felt a light abnormal vibration. Looking down at the engine indications; I saw N1 and N2 decreasing; followed by ENG FAIL displayed on our EGT for the #1 engine.The Captain obtained the Engine Failure or Shutdown QRH and gave me the radios; as I was already pilot flying. The CA (Captain) notified ATC that we had an engine failure but did not declare an emergency. At this time; our EGT indicator was reaching its max limitation and the CA made the decision to move the start lever to cutoff; prior to reaching this step in our Engine Failure checklist; to try and prevent exceeding our EGT max limitation. Continuing with the Engine Failure Checklist; we reached the engine restart portion; at which point the CA decided to do an In-Flight Restart. I stated that we exceeded the EGT limit and because of that; I questioned if we should restart the engine. The CA felt comfortable proceeding and explained that when restarting; or if at any point; we see the EGT rapidly increasing or approaching its limitation; we would shut the #1 engine down. I agreed with his plan; and ultimately felt we could still maintain a safe operation. The CA proceeded through the In-Flight Start Checklist. The start was successful and indications were normal. At this point; we were still descending and being vectored onto approach. I believe we were on about an 18 mile final. I began to configure early and when bringing throttles up; we felt a light vibration again. We decided to continue the approach in a partial single engine configuration with the left throttle at idle thrust; when the left throttle was at idle; there was no vibration and the engine indication were within parameters. We felt it was safer to keep the engine at idle rather than shutting it down during this phase of flight. When we felt the vibration after the second engine start; we notified ATC to contact ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting) to meet us as a precaution. Previously; the CA had pulled up performance numbers for single engine approach and flaps 15. Additionally; the runway was 12250ft; so we both felt comfortable landing with our configuration. The CA ran the single engine landing checklist and I landed the airplane. After landing; I did my after landing flow; the CA shutdown the #1 engine and we taxied to the gate.Looking back on this event; I would have changed a few things. First; I would have [requested priority handling] as soon as ATC was notified that we lost an engine. Second; rather than restarting the engine after it had exceeded its limitation; I feel we could have left the engine shutdown and proceeded single engine. Third; despite having been very busy; we should have notified the FA's (Flight Attendants) and Dispatch.,First Officer reported an uncommanded inflight engine shutdown; causing a partial single engine landing.

FO started down at 1000 fpm. We were then given a late-night 'Direct ZZZ' clearance and the thrust levers came back to idle. The #1 engine soon thereafter indicated ENG FAIL which was a bit disconcerting. The EGT for #1 was significantly higher than #2. I grabbed the QRH and said I was planning on running the ENG FAIL checklist while we evaluated the engine indications. The EGT at this point was above 800. I elected to do an immediate shutdown. We verified the engine and went to cutoff. The EGT was just in the red and began falling after cutoff and I continued the ENG FAIL checklist.I conveyed our engine failure condition to ATC and we were switched to Approach and checked in. Based on the normal indications on #1; we talked about a restart. The FO expressed his concern regarding restarting an engine after it had exceeded EGT redline. We ultimately agreed to restart with the understanding that an immediate shutdown may be required. Considering this; I got single-engine landing performance for the [long] Runway XXR in ZZZ. The XB restart went well and the engine appeared to be in a stable idle condition. During the Engine In-Flight Start; step #10 dictates; 'Engine GEN Switch; affected side... ON;' which I did. Considering the APU was already on the bus I realized later that it might've been wise to leave it on the APU versus loading up an already questionable engine.Later during the approach; the FO applied power and the #1 began to shudder. He brought #1 back to idle and continued the intercept and approach with the #2 - #1 remained idle. We worked through the One Engine Inop Landing Checklist. I had not officially [requested priority handling] at this point. I had neglected to do that on my initial engine-out report. The FO reminded me of this and I got it done. Considering the first indication of a problem was during descent; there was not much extra time. I didn't feel like contact with Dispatch would've been beneficial as we were fine on performance and proceeding to our destination.During descent at low power settings the engine failure and restart was transparent to the passengers; according to the FAs (Flight Attendant) later. I did not advise the FAs because of the time crunch and an expectation of a relatively normal landing. In retrospect I definitely should have given them a heads-up if for no other reason than to explain the presence of fire trucks after landing. After a flawless approach and nice landing by the FO - we had briefed no #1 reverse thrust - I taxied off the runway; shut #1 down; and taxied to Gate XX for the subsequent phone calls to Maintenance; FODO (Flight Operations Duty Officer); etc. We both spoke with the FAs about the situation. I have appreciated the follow-up regarding the possible causes of the failure and support from the union and company alike.,B737 Captain reported an inflight engine shutdown that resulted in a precautionary landing.

As we approached the WX the Center controller handed us off to the next sector. We checked on descending thru around FL300 and the controller stated he was irritated about everyone stepping on each other. He then called us to see if we were on frequency. We acknowledged his call and about that time I noticed traffic approaching us and they appeared to be at FL290. I was confused as we seemed to be descending right into them and the controller never mentioned them. About the time I realized we were going to conflict with the traffic we received a CLIMB RA (Resolution Advisory). I immediately followed the RA procedure and climbed until we received the 'clear of conflict' message around FL300. Somewhere in that time the controller asked if we were level at FL300 and we told him negative; that we were cleared to descend to FL240. He seemed very confused about our previous descent clearance and our check-on. He then cleared us direct ZZZZZ1 and to descend via the [arrival] which we did. WX deviation combined with a badly timed hand off. Also seems like the center controllers are being tasked with multiple frequencies and sectors and they are very task loaded when traffic picks up. I felt like I was a bit slow to recognize the threat and I could have slowed our descent thru FL300 until it was clarified; but in all reality the speed in which the event occurred combined with the doubt that what you're actually seeing is accurate lead to the delay. I had the range dialed out and at first I thought the traffic must be further away or the controller would have mentioned it. I thought for a few seconds that we must be descending thru the other aircraft's altitude in time to avoid a conflict. I was also working my descent around a large cell and trying to stay above several smaller buildups as we passed it but still keep the aircraft on profile when we rejoined the arrival. Multiple aircraft communicating at once also played a major role in the confusion. As is the case with so many incidents it all came to together at the WRONG time. If it looks like a conflict; change your flight path first and figure it out. It seems obvious to say; but just remembering that stuff just gets missed and ATC misses things just like the rest of us helps keep your awareness up when something just doesn't look right. Too easy to get lulled into a sense of complacency thinking 'that can't REALLY be an aircraft headed right towards us this close to our altitude.' We are always the last line of defense up there and we need to keep that in mind. Always.,A321 flight crew reported ATC was too busy working multiple sectors.

The Pilot Monitoring identified the #1 Engine Reverser light had illuminated with a slight engine rollback. We leveled off at 2;000 ft. MSL to identify and confirm the malfunction. ATC was notified and we were issued vectors while we ran the QRH Reverser Checklist. Because of the intermittent uncontrolled reverser deployment the #1 engine was shut down using the QRH Engine Failure Shutdown Checklist. We advised ATC and had emergency vehicles meet and inspect the aircraft upon landing. Control of the aircraft was transferred to the Captain. With the engine shut down and secured; we continued to get intermittent reverser deployment indications. The single engine approach and landing were normal. We taxied clear of Runway XXL for inspection. No issues were found with the aircraft so we elected to continue to the gate.,B737 flight crew reported an engine failure and return to airport.

This was the start of leg 2 for the day as we already operated out of ZZZ. There was another issue I will discuss after the conclusion of our [priority handling] event. [The] FO (First Officer) was pilot flying at the time. We took off out of ZZZ1 in very light rain throughout our departure. My FO stated it was barely enough rain to notice on the windshield. Light chop may have been experienced temporarily at most; but it was mostly smooth on climb out. We were cleared to flight level 31;000 where we stopped our descent. Shortly thereafter; while autopilot B was engaged; the autopilot started a significant descent all by itself. Unbeknownst to me and after speaking with my FO on the ground; the FO noticed his altimeter jumped from 31;000 ft. to 31;800 approximately. As soon as the autopilot started its descent; I took controls from the FO; disconnected the autopilot and leveled the airplane at 31;000 using my altimeter. I don't think we lost much altitude because I almost immediately disconnected the autopilot to arrest the pitch down moment. ATC shortly queried our altitude and we read back 31;000. ATC stated he saw us at approximately 31;700. About that time I looked over at the FO side and saw his altitude was the same as ATC verified 31700 ft. and looked at my display; which showed 31;000ft. ALT disagree was showing. At the same time; I noticed the FO airspeed was significantly slower than my airspeed and cross-checked the standby indicator - FO airspeed approximately 80 kt. slow. Airspeed disagree showed.At some point; I issued a pan pan pan. Standby airspeed and CA airspeed was the same and based on our thrust setting and altitude there was no doubt my FO's airspeed indicator was incorrect; 70-80 kt. too slow for our thrust and pitch setting. At that point; I determined; maybe incorrectly as I analyzed things on the ground; that since ATC had his altitude readout; I was basing our actual altitude on my FO's display and airspeed on my display. My reasoning is that 700-800 ft. high was safer than 700-800 ft. low; close to the ground; during approach and landing. Since I was now flying airspeed on my side and altitude on my FO's side; my altitude fluctuated up and down due to a gigantic 4 ft. scan instead of a normal 10 in. scan. Once I determined I could not hold altitude as expected; I asked for a block of altitude for airspace protection and was granted that clearance. The QRH for airspeed disagree was started; which led us to unreliable airspeed. We completed the checklist for unreliable airspeed and turned back towards ZZZ1. At some point after this realization I changed our pan pan to [requesting priority handling]. ATC apparently missed our [priority handling request] as he [provided priority handling] for us several minutes after I made the call myself. Upon realizing our altitude and airspeed unreliable; and ATC confirming ZZZ2 was VFR; I decided to turn back around another time to divert to ZZZ2 as it was a safer airport. Eventually; several altitude step downs were given to us for our descent into ZZZ2. QRH was completed and calls to Dispatch were then attempted.FO tried numerous times to contact company to relay our status and was unsuccessful. We attempted several calls on ZZZ3 Radio with no response. We asked ATC to call company and to contact us via ZZZ3 Radio; with no response from Dispatch. We then called on Guard to ask them to contact our Dispatch and let them know to contact us on ZZZ3 Radio; communication with Dispatch was never successful. With everything going on; I did not feel comfortable having my FO heads down sending an ACARS message...we were too busy.Descent checklist was soon completed and approach checklist was completed below 18;000. Holds were also accomplished to allow us time for checklists and getting weather info and setting up for the approach into ZZZ2 which were indicating 1100 ft. ceilings and better than required visibility. At some point in the descent; below 10;000 ft.; my FO realized the EEC were both in alternate mode and a discussion commenced. We discussed the thrust lever position and thrust changes that occurred in ALT mode but due to our [priority handling situation] and attempting to get the airplane on the ground safely; I forgot to have the FO run the QRH for the EEC alternate mode. Due to having no weather forecast and knowing weather was in the vicinity of ZZZ2 due to the hurricane remnants; my main concern was getting the aircraft on the ground safely in as close to VFR conditions as I could get.After landing; while discussing the events with my FO; we realized we probably should have made time to run this QRH procedure. I just didn't have the weather info in flight to make a call to continue holding to accomplish this checklist instead of landing. Landing VFR in my mind was a safer option than running this checklist and possibly losing VFR conditions due to hurricane remnants. The approach was set up and briefed and we commenced our approach. Checklists completed. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) standing by for us. The approach and landing was uneventful.After landing we were given instructions to taxi down a taxiway; XX or XY; [which] I did not feel was safe for us to turn down [to] as it was too narrow for my comfort. I also had concern that the taxiway could support our weight and relayed to Ground Control that I would not be accepting that taxiway. We did a 180 on a closed runway as Ground gave us permission to do so and frankly; that was our only option due to where the aircraft was stopped on the taxiway.We then returned to [the FBO] and parked. [The] incident was written in [the] logbook with my initial impression on what happed; the caution messages we received and that I thought airspeed was good on my side only and altitude was good on the FO side only. Airplane was chocked and secured; no door seals were on the aircraft. We shut down; secured the airplane; and then did the supplementary procedure for powering the aircraft down. We then exited the aircraft and closed the door. We called for the FBO to remove the stairs from the airplane for security purposes. The stairs were then pulled back from the aircraft and we exited the Ramp into the FBO. [The] Chief Pilot; DOO; Dispatch and Maintenance Control [were] all notified via my personal phone. The earlier situation I referenced was a runway change at clearance for pushback. Since we had not started the engines or changed configuration; I had the FO change our assigned runway and then consulted the TLR (Thrust Lever Resolver) for new numbers. I showed the FO the TLR data and he verified correct data for runway change. I then read him the new data to input since we were pushing back. What I did not realize is that RTO1 had not been selected at that time; but all other number were entered. At some point during the takeoff; prior to 60 kt.; thrust was set; I noticed we had TO (Takeoff) selected instead of RTO1 based on the N1 setting. When I referenced our airspeed at this realization; we had already exceeded 80 kt. I think I made the 80 kt. call at 82 kt. I determined the safest outcome was to continue the takeoff based on our rejected takeoff parameters. I had in the back of my mind a 5 kt. difference in V1 between RTO1 and TO as I had looked earlier due to the weather in ZZZ1 at the time. This situation has led me to realize it is most likely a better habit to have the FO read off the TLR data and I enter the numbers myself in the FMC. This was something I just didn't catch as I was starting to get tired from sitting there for an extended time.[The cause was] airspeed and altitude [being] unreliable due to an unknown problem. After reflecting on what occurred; I believe none of the altitude or airspeed information on my FO's outboard display unit was correct. I erroneously believed that ATC's readout of our altitude confirmed my FO's altimeter was correct without realizing his entire system had likely failed; providing erroneous information to ATC. The weather from the hurricane was certainly a contributing factor as my main concern was getting the airplane on the ground safely and landing in VFR conditions.,B737-800 flight crew reported an uneventful diversion due to unreliable airspeed and altitude indications during cruise.

A SYS HYD Quantity at that time was normal. After approximately 2 hours into the flight A SYS HYD quantity fell to 16%. Although the A SYS HYD electric pump was providing pressure for the A SYS; I believed that there was potential that we might experience a total loss of the A SYS hydraulics once the landing gear was extended. I [requested priority handling] and contacted Dispatch. We extended the landing gear early and it extended normally. On approach; the gear and all other systems functioned normally. Landing was normal and uneventful. We taxied to the gate and discovered that we had a major HYD leak in the A SYS pump.,B737 Captain reported loss of Hydraulic System A during cruise.

After we completed service; [Person A] and I started to smell a strong sour milk smell in the aft galley. It came and went about three times. We could not find a source for the smell; and no passengers complained of anything. The last time we noticed the smell was before descent. At this point my nausea had gotten worse. During final descent I started to feel a little lightheaded and dizzy. I thought it was getting better; but when I bent down to disarm my door; I had a hard time getting back up from being so lightheaded. At that point I asked [Person A] if she was feeling ok. She said she had been feeling lightheaded. So during deplaning I called the [Person B] and let her know what we were feeling. She told the Captain who suggested we talk to a supervisor and get checked out in case it was a cabin air quality event. We were met by a supervisor who then called EMTs to check us out. We decided to then go to the ER where we got blood tests; and it was determined that we had carbon monoxide poisoning. We listened to our bodies and paid attention when something was out of the norm.,Flight Attendant reported a 'sour milk' smell was noticed during flight resulting in health issues.

The First Officer and I performed the memory items and initiated the commanded climb. I advised ATC of our situation and was told by the controller that no other aircraft were observed in our area. TCAS then commanded us to descend and we also complied while looking outside for any intruding aircraft. The alert then said we were clear and went away. We regained our original altitude with no further conversation with ATC. All appeared normal and we determined the alert was false. The TCAS gave us 2 more false alarms. The 2nd was level at 30;000 feet and the 3rd was at 3;000 feet. While being vectored for the ILS Approach. Once on the ground the faulty TCAS was written up. Maintenance and Dispatch were made aware of the problem. After talking to Maintenance I was informed the TCAS system had been a continuing problem with multiple write-ups. I believe we were the first to get an RA alert; but it would've helped if someone had given us a heads up.,A Flight Crew reported receiving false TCAS RA advisories and stated maintenance told them it was a recurring issue with their aircraft.

Flight attendants rang the call button and indicated they heard loud banging and wanted to verify we heard the same. We shallowed our climb then leveled off at FL 280 and [advised ATC]. Subsequent flight attendant chime indicated they saw flames had extended aft of the #1 engine. We had already begun to tackle the surge / stall QRC followed by QRH checklist when they called advised of flames. We recognized and agreed that ZZZ was our best option due to proximity (80 miles roughly ) off our nose with optimum field capabilities. We coordinated with flight attendants and talked with a non-rev commuting Company Captain who had been sitting on left side of cabin and had seen the flames. During this process; we coordinated with ATC for direct and began a descent to ZZZ [and] fired off a quick message to Dispatch indicating engine malfunction and plan to divert. We coordinated with crew of the precautionary landing and advised passengers of our intentions. In the descent we completed the appropriate checklists; acquired the [weight and balance] data for landing in addition to brake cooling then were vectored for a visual approach to [Runway] XXL. We landed uneventfully and taxied clear of the runway and we were met by Fire and Rescue. We shut down the #1 engine and awaited CFR to evaluate. CFR gave us the all clear and we taxied to gate and began to coordinate with all appropriate personnel.,B737 flight crew reported engine compressor stall and surges resulted in divert to precautionary landing.

I performed the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) actions and follow up for the message which included shutting down the engine. The Captain [advised ATC]. We landed without further incident.I don't know what caused the indication but we had multiple indications which led us to believe it was not an erroneous indication and resulted ultimately in the engine shutdown per the ECAM.I believe it was a mechanical issue but I was unable to find a clear procedure for what to do for an intermittent (or even steady) ENG 1 OIL LO PR Amber Caution message with other supporting indications. Having a discussion in training about unusual/non standard situations would be helpful insight. ATC was very accommodating and we found it helpful to have ATC provide us a separate frequency to communicate with Tower and ARFF (Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting) simultaneously. ARFF was very responsive and communication was excellent. It was a seamless process on final approach with our requests.,Air Carrier Flight Crew flying A-321 aircraft reported low engine oil pressure inflight.

Pushback; start; taxi; takeoff and climb out were uneventful. Passing FL260 for a cruise altitude of FL270 the First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) identified a flashing oil quantity advisory reading and a low oil pressure indication on the #1 engine system display. Due to the aircraft's momentum and vertical rate of climb the Captain (Pilot Flying) elected to level off at FL270 as planned. Initially the zero oil quantity and low 60 PSI pressure indication were not accompanied by an ECAM message and system status indicated normal. Within a couple of minutes a series of intermittent ECAM cautions and warnings occurred leading to an engine shutdown condition. The amber ENG 1 OIL LO PR Caution illuminated first on the ECAM display. The crew responded by initiating the company non-normal checklist strategy. The Captain announced 'my aircraft' then the First Officer verified that the ECAM was not a Quick Action or ECAM exception item. The Captain elected to remain flying and also took control of the radio. It was a crew awareness only caution so the FO (First Officer) then checked the QRH for follow up items. This Caution does not direct the crew to adjust thrust settings. During this process the caution [message] cleared itself without any inputs from the crew but the zero oil quantity and 60 PSI indications remained. At this point the ECAM display was clear and system status indicated normal. Shortly thereafter the red ENG 1 LO PR warning illuminated on the ECAM display. This occurred intermittently 3 times and then cleared itself each time resulting in a normal system status display on the ECAM. Oil quantity remained at zero and pressure was now steady at 40 PSI on the system display. These intermittent ECAM warnings lasted for approximately 2-3 seconds and then cleared to a normal status for roughly the same amount of time. The next time the ECAM warning illuminated it remained steady and the crew followed the ENG 1 LO PR warning procedures and shutdown the engine. The crew notified Center and requested a radar vector descent to final for the engine out approach at ZZZ1. The non-normal indications initially occurred just prior to the ETP (equal time point) between ZZZ and ZZZ1. However by the time the ECAM directed engine shutdown the flight had progressed passed the ETP and was at a normal descent point for ZZZ1. Dispatch was called using the iPad crew phone and notified of the nature of the emergency and decision to land at ZZZ1. The flight attendants and passengers were briefed about the Precautionary Landing at ZZZ1 and the possibility of airport fire vehicles near the aircraft. After shutting down the engine and notifying ATC; the crew requested and was given a vector and descent direct to a left 10 NM base at ZZZ1. Descent and approach were very stable and normal. The Captain flew the descent and approach with both the autopilot and auto thrust on. Crew requested ARFF (airport rescue fire department) for the landing and cleared the runway for a brief inspection of the engine. On request of the crew the fire department followed the aircraft to the gate. Shutdown at the gate and passenger deplaning were normal. Note: ATC handling by ZZZ Center; ZZZ1 Approach and Tower were outstanding. Handoff from Tower to ARFF at ZZZ1 was seamless and well coordinated. Flight Attendant performance was also outstanding and the passengers remained well informed throughout the emergency. Although oil fault indications were somewhat intermittent and erratic the fact that multiple independent sensors indicated a problem caused the crew to shutdown the #1 engine when directed by the ENG LO PR Warning ECAM. After the flight; maintenance personnel initially reported normal engine oil quantity on a sight gauge even though the engine instrument remained at zero. Initially crew suspects a partial blockage or pump failure in the system without oil loss. The engine oil quantity and pressure indications were initially both alarming and confusing. As the adrenaline level increased for the crew due to the perception there would be an engine shutdown there was also a level of doubt that the indications were accurate. Low oil pressure on the engine instrument should be accompanied by a Low Pressure ECAM Caution or Warning. Why did the pressure remain steady in the amber range with zero on the quantity? This is an uncomfortable situation because our training does not address multiple oil failures without ECAM warnings. It puts the flight crew into one of those gray areas where a Captain is expected to make a decision based on the information he has on hand in a situation not covered in training. The natural instinct of a pilot is to shutdown an engine before complete oil loss to prevent a catastrophic failure. In this occurrence engine indications identified a problem well in advance of ECAM warnings. Yet crew training and aircraft procedures generally do not address engine shutdown without ECAM warning checklist direction. Should crews be given shutdown discretion in the absence of ECAM warnings and checklist? In this situation the Captain elected to continue as the Pilot Flying while the crew worked through the non-normal checklist strategy. Even though most aspects of company's non-normal strategy were performed correctly the overall pace and structure were hampered by the Captain continuing to fly. In this case the checklist strategy would have been better managed if the Captain had delegated flying to the FO. For example; when the ECAM directed the 'Engine Master Switch-Off' both pilots confirmed it was the #1 engine but the Captain positioned it to off. Procedure dictates that the non-flying pilot position the switch to off.,Air Carrier Captain flying A321 aircraft reports low engine oil pressure inflight.

After departing ZZZ1 while climbing through Flight Level 280 on our way up to FL340 Autopilot #1 disconnected and would not reengage. A/P (Autopilot) #2 would engage but after about 30 seconds it also disengaged along with the auto thrust going into THRUST LOCK mode. Then several ECAMs (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) appeared including RUD TRIM1 FAULT; YAW DAMPER 1; RUD TRV LIM 1. The First Officer ran the Quick Reference Handbook procedures for each of those problems which included resetting the FACs (Flight Augmentation Computer).We leveled at FL340 and the aircraft was exhibiting a slight Dutch Roll tendency so we descended to FL280 and no more Dutch Roll was observed. Autopilots could be intermittently engaged; flight directors would come and go; autothrust would disengage in THRUST LOCK mode. We consulted with Dispatch and [Maintenance Control] via phone patch. Without further attempting to engage autopilots or autothrust events seemed to stabilize and with consult with Dispatch we planned to continue to destination. We began evaluating along route alternates and asked Dispatch to do the same. Shortly thereafter the flight directors started to come and go repeatedly along with the previously described ECAMS. When each rudder ECAM came and went there was a discernible yaw felt. Other messages would appear momentarily then clear such as 2FD2; and BOTH PFDs (Primary Flight Display) on SINGLE SOURCE (not sure of the wording as it would momentarily flash then disappear).At this time we made the decision to divert and after evaluating the weather decided with dispatch concurrence to divert to ZZZ2. An [urgent situation] was declared with ATC and a clearance to ZZZ2 was obtained and a safe landing was made. ECAMS intermittently continued while enroute.The aircraft was always fully under control. After gate arrival I debriefed with the [Flight Manager] and maintenance log entries were submitted. Briefed local ZZZ2 maintenance personnel.,Air Carrier Captain flying A319 aircraft diverted due to aircraft mechanical malfunction.

Shortly thereafter the Captain received a call from the cabin crew; I believe notifying him about the same noise we were hearing. We then asked ATC for a lower altitude in hopes of the noise stopping. Shortly after that the Captain received another call from the cabin crew; when he hung up the phone he told me we were returning to our departure airport ZZZ due to claims of smoke or fumes in the cabin. I then donned my oxygen mask and notified ATC with our intentions to return to ZZZ. We were then given a lower altitude and vectors. We conducted the smoke/fumes checklist. We also decided ZZZ1 airport would be closer and notified ATC we would be landing there. We landed in ZZZ1 without incident where we had the ARFF (airport rescue firefighters) search our aircraft for any hot spots while still on the runway. After no hot spots were found we taxied to the gate where we deplaned normally. The pressurization leak that caused a loud noise and I never heard what the cabin crew smelled in the cabin. I really can't come up with any suggestions that would have prevented this event without knowing what caused the leak and what caused the smell.,A321 First Officer reported a cabin fumes event during climb and cruise level off resulting in a diversion. The fumes were reportedly caused by a pressurization leak.

Departed late due to ELAC (Elevator & Aileron Computer) 1 MEL (Minimum Equipment List).  South of ZZZ at FL390; we had ECAM for HYD (Hydraulic) G RSVR (Reservoir) LO AIR PR (Low Air Pressure).  I ran the ECAM and told ATC we had a HYD issue.  ECAM put us into ATL LAW (Alternate Law) and FO (First Officer) had to hand fly.  We asked for lower altitude and told ATC we wanted ZZZ1 and I sent ACARS to Dispatch.   I was running the COM and getting ATIS and found out ZZZ was showing 002OVC (200' Overcast) and 1 1/2 vis (Visibility).  I asked ATC if there was anything better for weather and he said the region was all the same.  We decided to go to ZZZ.  Once the COM was complete I called and briefed the FA's (Flight Attendants) and made PA to the passengers.  We decided that I would take over and fly the approach and landing. We briefed the ILS 11 Approach and the FO hand flew the Aircraft until about 15-20 mile final so I could take my time and take a few minutes to 'gather my thoughts.'  We started to configure early and we had to gravity extend the gear.  Now we were in direct law and started to fly the approach..  We saw the approach lights and continued and saw the runway at minimums.  We landed.  We taxied to the gate and briefed the passengers and deplaned.  I made the phone calls to Company; Dispatch and Maintenance.  Maintenance looked at the issue and found out there was HYD fluid all over and we had a bad O ring.

Declared minimum fuel on go-around in order to expedite landing since fuel now was an issue with extra fuel burn and not much to play. Controller was going to extend us downwind behind an arriving aircraft which would have added more time and fuel so I elected to [request] an immediate turn to the FAF for XXC. I didn't want XXL because of animal issue and another possible go-around. Controller vectored preceding aircraft off their approach and cleared us for visual XXC. Landed uneventfully with 3.9 fuel.....2.10 left tank and 1.8 right tank. Reserve Fuel on Flight Plan was 3.78.Cause: Dispatched with normal arrival fuel with very good weather. Controller vectored us low and slow which increased fuel burn. Suggestions: Next time I will not accept so many vectors and low and slow increasing fuel burn when I do not have extra fuel to play.,B737-800 Captain reported a low fuel situation developed following a go-around to avoid an animal on the runway.

We leveled off at 2;500 ft. worked the problem and the Captain was able to get com1 back by using the ALT switch. All the communications on the First Officer side of the plane had died I could not use the hot mic or communicate with ATC on my side I tired different headsets and nothing worked. We then decided to return to ZZZ since we were going out over the water on our way to ZZZ1. WE had to burn 14;000 lbs. of fuel to get under max landing weight. We ended up holding over ZZZ VOR since the weather in the area was raining and turbulent and ZZZ VOR was in the clear and smooth. We worked the Flight Attendant; Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and ATC; till we had burned off enough fuel to return to land in ZZZ. We kept the passengers informed of what was going on as much as we could during the entire event.,Air carrier First Officer reported that both VHF radios stopped working during departure; resulting in a diversion.

We see that the number was going down; showing that we are losing oil. I started to go through the iPad QRH for an appropriate checklist. While looking; the Captain said 'your aircraft' so I took over pilot duties (it was his leg). He was looking at the Low Oil checklist when the oil qty went to zero; and the Captain decided to just shutdown the engine before it got worse. We [advised ATC] and a turn back towards ZZZ. We ran the engine shutdown checklist. I was flying; he was doing the checklists; radio; and the procedures; as recommended by our training department. We were still over max landing weight; and needed time to run all the supplemental checklists and procedures; so we decided to land at ZZZ and burn fuel to get under max landing weight at the same time. The single engine ILS into ZZZ was textbook. We taxied off the runway; was inspected by CFR; and then taxied to the gate.The Low Oil Quantity checklist is not easily found; as it is not in the index as 'low oil quantity' or 'oil low quantity' and it only reference oil pressure in the index.There was no audio or visual alert; when the oil quantity was half what it was supposed to be. We just happened to catch the small indication on the lower screen; and watched it drop to zero. I don't think we could have caught it any faster than we did.,B737-800 flight crew reported loss of engine oil; causing an in-flight shut down and a diversion to a precautionary landing.

Was on standby instruments.  I took the aircraft from FO and requested priority handling. With help from ATC.  Landed VFR safely at ZZZ.  Found the IRUs not properly aligned.With constant interruptions preparing for the flight by flight attendants; fuel slips; security forms; I failed to properly align the IRUs.  I usual devote my attention to this process and can only imagine that I got interrupted.  I was also tired.  Everything seemed normal on taxi out.  I was able to update the position at the end of the runway.  I had a First Officer brand new to the airplane.  Just finished IOE.  Ultimately it was my fault I take full responsibility.  I feel terrible about it.  Pilot error on my part.,B737-300 Captain reported they lost flight instruments on both sides and navigation capability during climbout resulting in a diversion.  Captain stated the IRUs were not properly aligned and cited multiple distractions and fatigue as contributing factors.

ECAM L/G (Landing Gear) SHOCK ABSORBER fault observed. Shortly A/P (Auto Pilot) and Auto Thrust disconnected. Flight Directors; A/P; Auto Thrust were intermittent throughout entire flight. Captain ran appropriate checklist while PF (Pilot Flying) manually flew aircraft. Notified ATC; notified Dispatch; flight attendants and passengers of intent to return to ZZZ. Lost navigation auto-tuning radios on approach executed go-around. Hard tuned radios manually and flew raw data approach. Approach and initial touchdown were normal. Once nose wheel made contact with the ground; aircraft began to shake and stopped on the runway. ECAM LGCIU 2 fault appeared told passengers and flight attendants to remain seated and requested ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting) to come to aircraft. No fire observed by ARFF.  Maintenance confirmed nose gear was 90 degrees to the aircraft centerline.   Maintenance replaced nose tires and passengers were deplaned onto buses and returned to the terminal. Aircraft was towed to Maintenance. Communication with Company; flight attendants and airport was good.,A319 flight crew reported a nose gear malfunction after takeoff resulting in a return to departure airport.

FA (Flight Attendants) 3 and 4 reported smelling sweet glue like odor that went away in about 15 min. About 35 min. into flight FA 3 reported a headache and FA 4 reported headache and nausea. FA 2 reported the smell was faint but did smell it but felt OK. FA 1 and flight deck did not smell odor. The odor was noted from Row 10 to aft of aircraft. The FA 4 reported feeling worse at 35 min. into flight so we elected to return to ZZZ. 1 passenger in 13A reported slight irritation in nose and slight headache. On return to ZZZ as a [prioritized] aircraft on descent through 10;000 ft. flight deck and cabin noticed a distinct odor like Elmer's Glue. Uneventful landing with flight deck on O2 and cabin use of 4 portable O2 bottles. FA 4 went to hospital remaining crew felt fine and continued on new aircraft to ZZZ1 as rescheduled.The probable cause was possible oil leak but no indications in flight deck.Dependent on maintenance findings.,A321 Captain reported a cabin fumes event during initial climb resulting in a return to the departure airport.

We had an A321 sharklet. Every portion of the beginning of the flight leg from gate departure; takeoff and climb up to the fume event was normal and routine. At sometime above 10;000 ft. we got a call from our #1 FA (Flight Attendant) telling us that the FAs in Economy Class more towards the rear of the aircraft were smelling a sweat odor and a more robust glue type odor. I believe from my prospective that the odor came from the back from the wings black wards because we did not smell anything in the flight deck and no one smelled anything in first class; #1 FA or forward section of the cabin behind 1st class section. Captain began trouble shooting the problem with the QRH guidelines and the FAs that was smelling the odors. One of the FAs was feeling ill from the fume which was strong in the area they were working. Passenger in that area smelled the odors as well. Captain asked if she can continue or do we need to get back to the gate in ZZZ so she can seek medical attention. She was not sure if she wanted to continue on toward ZZZZ1 or return. Captain asked the #1 FA to monitor the FA's condition and if she worsened we will return to ZZZ. While we were discussing the QRH fume trouble shooting pages and making plans to return to ZZZ or another airport that may be closer to our position if we continued to fly farther away from ZZZ; the #1 FA called and told us the FA that was feeling ill was on O2 and was not getting better. So we notified ATC that we will be returning to ZZZ which was the best option to land. We [were given priority handling] to expedite our return to ZZZ and so the FA can get the medical attention she needed. As we began to descend into ZZZ I remember it was below FL180 and through landing that the odors began to infiltrate the flight deck and the #1 FA and passengers began smelling it too. We donned our O2 masks. It was a sweaty smell and it also had an Elmer's glue order to us. The odors continued until we arrived to the gate. The FA that was really ill went to the hospital and the remaining flight crew continued with us to ZZZZ1 with a replacement FA.I don't know of any causal factors that would cause a fume event other than fixing the problem of the source that caused the fumes from escaping and preventing and future leaks from going into the cabin.The only thing that would prevent this from happening would be a complete redesign of the airplane systems that keeps the cabin ventilation isolated from any possible fume leaking into the cabin.,A321 First Officer reported a fumes event during departure climb resulting in a return to the departure airport.

While on rollout; the low visibility obscured runway activity until no other choice was available.Onboard equipment failed; distracting crew from making radio positions reporting to ZZZ traffic. Event occurred after Tower had closed for the night.Good accident prevention was conducted by all vehicles and aircraft involved; and no other problems occurred.This could have been a classic example of 'Chain of events causing a accident.'  A late departure because of icing conditions at origin. Weather at arrival airport causing snow removal equipment to be on runway for extended periods of time. A minor problem during the approach to landing phase distracted the crew; and company procedures required crew to be playing the role of both flying and non-flying pilot at the same time.      In this case; I believe; safety would have been better served if once the decision to hand off control was made; we didn't change back 600-400 feet above the ground. Once the decision was made our roles would have been clearer; and airplane radio communication would have been made at the critical trigger points.,B737 flight crew reported a ground conflict with an airport vehicle during landing roll at an airport that was non-towered at the time of the event. The crew did not make the proper CTAF radio announcements prior to landing.

FO (First Officer) was pilot flying. Passing through 4;000 feet MSL on climbout from ZZZ we noticed a fuel imbalance developing - right wing main tank fuel indication already 400 pounds lower than left wing. Right wing main tank fuel appeared to be feeding at approximately twice the rate of the left and it appeared that the center tank fuel was not feeding at all. Engine fuel flow readings appeared normal and equal. By 10;000 feet MSL the imbalance had increased to the point that the IMBAL alert was activated. We coordinated with ATC to level off at 12;000 feet MSL in order to reduce fuel flow and begin taking appropriate action. Upon leveling at 12;000 feet MSL we observed the right fuel tank quantity feed rate appear to normalize and then observed a 50 pound increase in right main tank fuel quantity. Fuel imbalance at that point was 1;100 pounds. We initiated the IMBAL checklist in the QRH. Observing what then appeared to be normal tank quantity indications for a crossfeed operation; we coordinated with ATC to continue our climb and proceed on course to the destination knowing we would also coordinate with Dispatch and maintenance promptly to determine if proceeding to ZZZ1 was advisable. As soon as we established climb fuel flow settings and pitch attitude; the right main tank quantity began to decrease again at what appeared to be the same abnormal rate observed during the initial climb. We then requested priority handling initiated the return to ZZZ (nearest airport) and started the APU as a precaution. I advised Dispatch; the cabin crew; and the passengers of the situation using SOP. As soon as we stopped the climb to initiate the return to ZZZ the right main fuel tank indication again stopped decreasing at an abnormal rate. We concluded the IMBAL checklist and for the remainder of the flight we observed no further indications of abnormal rate of decrease in right main wing tank fuel. During the descent; I spoke with the flight attendants and they confirmed that there were no visible indications of fuel leaks on either wing or engine. We landed uneventfully at ZZZ with a total imbalance of 1;220 pounds with 8;370 pounds in the left wing; 7;150 pounds in the right wing and 13;470 pounds in the center tank - 29;000 points total. The aircraft was below max landing weight at touchdown. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) personnel were standing by as requested. After landing and before further taxi; ARFF personnel inspected the aircraft closely and reported no leaks; no visible damage; and no abnormalities. We shut down the number 2 engine as an additional precaution and requested that the ARFF vehicles follow us to our gate. Maintenance personnel were debriefed in person at the gate upon arrival.Captain suspects suspect faulty fuel crossfeed valve.Reporter recommends company consider revisiting the IMBAL checklist in light of this particular malfunction.,B73-800 Captain reported an uneventful air return due to an airborne fuel system malfunction during initial climb.

We climbed to planned cruise altitude without issue. Shortly after reaching cruise and just south of ZZZ1; an ECAM message and associated chime presented on the lower ECAM screen indicating 'ENG 1 SYSTEM FAULT'. We worked through the indicated actions and referenced the COM procedures. As the engine was reduced to idle thrust only; we began a descent and began diversion planning as it became clear that we could not continue to ZZZ2 with this issue at the lower altitude required on a single engine at ZZZ3. Initially ZZZ was selected; but while I was flying and communicating with ATC the Captain in consultation with the dispatcher elected to divert instead to ZZZ4. With plenty of time to prepare we did all necessary tasks for the diversion and proceeded to an uneventful landing on ZZZ's longest runway; XXR; with fire/rescue services on standby. After landing with no issues we taxied to the assigned gate and shut down the aircraft without issue.,A320 First Officer reported an in-flight engine problem required a diversion and single-engine approach and landing.

Accomplishing ECAM led us to the L/G Gravity Extension QRH and after accomplishing checklist the gear safely extended. We (advised ATC) and coordinated with Flight Attendants and Dispatch and ZZZ for subsequent runway closure and tow to the gate.,A320 Captain reported a landing gear malfunction.

We had been cleared for the approach to Runway XX and were established on the localizer and glideslope. The autopilot and autothrust had been disengaged earlier in the approach and the aircraft had been configured to Flaps 3 when Gear Down was requested. When the gear lever was selected down the three indicators on the landing gear panel indicated red UNLK (UNLOCKED); no noise from the landing gear doors opening was heard. Captain [Name] and I communicated and confirmed on the Landing Gear Systems page that the landing gear had not extended. We decided to level out at 6;000 feet MSL while we confirmed the situation and attempted to cycle the gear. We communicated to the tower we would be going around for a landing gear failure approximately 3mi prior to the runway. Tower provided vectors and a climb to 9;000 feet; we initiated a go around over the threshold per ATC instructions and cleaned up the aircraft per SOP. The autoflight was re-engaged after the go around. During this time after the failure of subsequent attempts to cycle the gear and with the lever still down; we eventually got the L/G GEAR NOT DOWNLOCKED ECAM. The ECAM was run according to SOP by Captain [Name] while I flew the aircraft and handled radio calls. We [received priority]; stated our intention to return to land on Runway XYR and requested CFR (Crash Fire Rescue Equipment). Gravity extension was successful and we were vectored to the approach. Approach and landing were normal with the exception of the gear doors remaining open. We landed with 8000 lbs. of fuel. We stopped on the runway and Operations was standing by to tow the aircraft back to the gate.,First Officer reported a Go Around and precautionary  landing after landing gear lock problems.
1789369,202102,0601-1200,US,Air Carrier,Passenger,B737 Undifferentiated or Other Model,Cruise,Oil Indicating System,Captain; Pilot Not Flying,Flight Crew Multiengine; Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,Aircraft Equipment Problem Critical,Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action; Flight Crew Landed in Emergency Condition; Flight Crew Inflight Shutdown; Flight Crew Diverted; General Flight Cancelled / Delayed; General Maintenance Action,Aircraft,Aircraft,Aircraft X departing from ZZZ bound for ZZZ1 scheduled to depart at XA:45. My FO (First Officer) and I both discussed the hydraulic maintenance write ups from the previous day and saw no obvious irregularities. All ground activities were normal; I.e. engine start and taxi. FO was the pilot flying; I was the pilot monitoring. Climb to our cruise altitude of FL380 was uneventful. Approximately 40 minutes into flight we got the B system engine low pressure light; we used the QRH procedures for this malfunction which resulted in the switch being turned off. We checked the system page and saw that our fluid quantity was rising and stabilized at 106% and pressure was at approximately 2700 psi. The #2 oil filter bypass light came on; we again used the QRH which had us reduce thrust on the #2 engine to see if the light would extinguish. After moving the throttle to idle the light was still illuminated which; as per the checklist; required us to shut down the engine. Immediately prior to shutting down the engine I contacted Purser with our plan to secure the engine; our ETA to ZZZ1; and state that no cabin prep would be necessary. He told us that a deadheading pilot was onboard so we asked that he send him forward to the cockpit. Upon completion of the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist we advised ATC; got a more direct turn to ZZZ1; and descended to FL240. Once established at FL240 we saw that our closest divert airport was ZZZ2; we requested and received ATC clearance direct to the field. Our decision to proceed to ZZZ2 vs. ZZZ1 was passed on to Purser. We tried initially to contact Dispatch by sending a 'Call me' message from the ACARS. It took quite a while to get a response containing a frequency and I think the actual first response we got from Dispatch was that they had noticed that we had descended and wondered if we were having an issue. We did confirm that we had shut down an engine and once a decision had been made to go to ZZZ2 we confirmed that with Dispatch through ACARS messaging. We had good communication with Center but were never able to speak to Dispatch; though as we got close to ZZZ2 we did hear ZZZ3 ARINC; though they could never hear us. At about the same time Center notified us that our company was trying to contact us on the frequency that we had previously been given; we told them that they could not hear us so they relayed our final intentions to the company. I can only assume that our altitude might have played a role in this poor communication with Dispatch; though we had no issues with ATC. In the approximately 45 minutes of cruise prior to descent into ZZZ2; we discussed steps taken; checklist to be completed (One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist) and other considerations. As a result; I switched pilot flying and pilot monitoring duties. At approximately 60 miles from ZZZ2 we commenced our descent. With all checklists complete and planning for a flaps 15 approach to the ILS at ZZZ2; we were given an intercept heading and selected flaps 15 for landing. The flaps did not move; so we requested vectors across final while we troubleshot the flaps. At this time I assumed the duties of flying the aircraft and talking to ATC. [The other two pilots] took on the task of determining why the flaps did not extend. Shortly after; we checked our system page and discovered that we had zero B System hydraulic quantity; I do not recall the B system pressure. We decided to run the Loss of System B checklist which led us to electrically extend the flaps. After one more series of turns to intercept final; we fully configured and executed an uneventful approach and landing at ZZZ2. After being inspected by Fire and Rescue Crews we taxied to our gate.,Captain reported loss of System B engine driven hydraulic pump and the number 2 engine filter bypass light illuminating resulted in an inflight shutdown of the number two engine and a diversion.

I surmised that the crew rejected the takeoff and subsequently swapped out of the aircraft after returning to the gate and the aircraft was not flown afterwards. The corrective action was a check of the Takeoff Configuration Warning System with no faults noted. Since nothing was actually corrected; the Captain and I discussed the possibility of it activating again on our takeoff. We pushed late due to an unrelated finding of damage in the floor of the Forward Cargo Bin C. The bin was deferred and bags transferred to the aft bin. We were relatively full on this flight and our V1/VR speeds for Flaps 1 on Runway XXR were 125/135. The engine start and taxi out were uneventful with the throttle burst yielding no takeoff warning. On the takeoff roll at approximately 130 knot (5 knot after V1) the takeoff warning horn and light activated. We elected to continue the takeoff. The initial climb was normal and we discussed that we would be writing this up in ZZZ1. The Captain called for 'flaps up' at the appropriate speed and I moved the flap lever to UP. We had a few distractions from ATC due to hold-down altitude that was cancelled. Before I moved the landing gear handle to OFF; I checked the flap indicator and noticed that the flaps were still at 1 with the LE FLAP EXT green light illuminated. After confirming that the flap handle was up; I told the Captain the issue and that we need to keep our airspeed below 250 kts. and level off to handle the problem.After notifying ATC that we would need to level off; they gave us vectors for terrain while we ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree. Since the QRH doesn't really address the disagreement when attempting to RETRACT the flaps and only deals with setting the flaps for landing; we turned our attention to coordinating the air return. Dispatch was advised of the return as well as Station Ops in ZZZ. Our current gross weight was a little over 130;000 pounds so we extended the gear to add drag and burn off excess fuel for landing. The F/As (Flight Attendants) and passengers were notified of the return. Since this was a flight control issue; we [received priority handling] and notified ATC that we were requesting [Runway] XYL but would need time to reduce our landing weight to 128;000 pounds. We felt this was the safe option as time was not an issue. We then ran the QRH; ran the performance calculation for the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree QRH; and then the brake cooling module. The flaps extended normally with the Alternate Flap system to 15 degrees. The only slight issue was although I read the section directing the flap lever to be moved to the final flap position (15); we were sidetracked by discussing slowing during the extension and this was not done until after the QRH was completed. This allowed us to see our Flaps 15 maneuvering speed. After the delay vectors were complete and we were below the maximum landing weight; we made an uneventful landing on [Runway] XYL. Brake cooling allowed us to take right to the gate and the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) trucks followed. No other issues occurred. We swapped into another aircraft and continued the pairing.,Flight Crew reported a repeat failure of the Take Off Warning System and a failure of trailing edge flaps to retract caused an Air Tun Back and a precautionary emergency landing.

Maintenance did a reset and signed off logbook as reset ok for service. FOs MAP was restored. Approximately 2 hours into flight and approximately 30 mins from ZZZZ1 enroute to ZZZZ; FOs MAP failed; followed by Captain's CWS (control wheel steering) fail; autothrottle failure; and SINGLE FMC operation message. Very shortly later; approximately 10 seconds; LNAV/ VNAV failed; both FMCs failed. Opposite autopilot selected; autopilot B. Captain's CWS was restored and one FMC was restored allowing for the engagement of LNAV/VNAV; and autothrottle was restored. FOs MAP still indicated a failure. Within approximately 60 seconds we had another dual FMC failure; followed by another LNAV/ VNAV failure; autothrottle failure; Captain's CWS failure. At this time with over two hours left to ZZZZ and navigating by raw data we decided it was the best course of action to divert to ZZZZ1 where the weather was favorable for landing with these navigational failures. We notified ZZZZ1 Center of our issues and intent to land in ZZZZ1. Around this time the Captain's FMC was restored automatically and we were once again able to navigate with LNAV/VNAV and the autothrottle and Captain's CWS was restored and autopilot was operational. As we neared ZZZZ1 we informed ATC of the need to hold to burn off fuel due to being overweight for landing which took approximately 10 minutes. The remainder of the flight was uneventful; we landed on Runway X and commenced the ILS approach in VFR conditions. The FOs MAP warning flag remained in view for the rest of the flight. My FO; Fas (Flight Attendants) did outstanding jobs. Great communication. ZZZZ1 ATC also very professional and helpful. In the 21 years I've been on the 737 both as an CA (Captain) and FO I've never experienced a dual FMC failure. I've experienced several single FMC failures; but not dual failures leading to several other navigation failures.,Captain reported a diversion to a precautionary landing following the loss of both Flight Management Computers which caused the loss of Cockpit Display Units and most navigation systems.

Just after liftoff; the nose trim ran high speed nose up on its own. I waited a quick moment and told the Captain that I was not doing that trim command; and then pushed forward on the yoke to stop the runaway. After retracting the flaps; I relaxed forward pressure and the trim continued nose up runaway at slow speed. I pressed the electric time nose down on the yoke; and the up trim stopped its uncommanded nose up runaway. Then we ran the Stabilizer Runaway Checklist and returned back to ZZZ uneventfully.,Pilot reported a runaway stabilizer trim system and elected to air turn back and make a precautionary emergency landing.

There were no discrepancies were noted.  We departed ZZZ for ZZZ1. Once in cruise; the Captain and I noticed the oil quantity decreasing. We consulted the QRH for low oil quantity. As the quantity continued to decrease; the Captain called dispatch and maintenance for any guidance or assistance they could give.  The tech told the Captain to follow the QRH.  The Captain and I began discussing engine shutdown and diversion scenarios. The oil level eventually fell to zero. Over a period of time; the oil pressure also began to fall slowly and we now were consulting the low oil pressure and engine shutdown procedures in the QRH.  In the descent to ZZZ airport ; the oil pressure dropped to where the QRH directs engine shutdown. We followed the engine shutdown checklist and [advised the TRACON]. We were vectored for a Visual approach to runway XX. When we transferred to ZZZ1 tower; we were cleared to land. A few miles from landing; ZZZ1 tower advised us that ZZZ2 tower reported possible missing cowlings from our engine. The Captain informed me that he was going to stop on the runway to find out if there was aircraft damage before proceeding to the gate. The landing and rollout were normal and we stopped the aircraft on the runway. After an inspection of the aircraft; the fire commander gave us the all clear to proceed to our gate with rescue personnel following. At the gate and after the jet bridge was brought to the aircraft; we were met by two mechanics. We briefed them on the situation and they went outside to investigate. Once they opened the cowls; I went down to find out if they had any idea what happened. I could see that the inner cowl was covered with oil on the inside; but there was no evidence of oil on the outside of the nacelle and only a little had dripped on the ground. I was told by one of the mechanics that they found an 'oil plug' in the bottom of the inside cowl when they opened the engine cowls. I returned to the cockpit to brief the Captain with the information I acquired on the ramp.,Flight Crew reported a loss of engine oil quantity and a loss of oil pressure caused an inflight shut down of the engine and an ATC guided landing.

It was very faint; but noticeable. It smelled like glycol or plastic burning. It remained constant until we initiated a descent from FL390-FL370. The smell became more pronounced. For lack of another checklist or procedure; we ran the smoke fire and fumes QRH. The smell was only in the cockpit and not the cabin. Since we could not determine the source. We deemed it appropriate to take the safest course of action to expedite getting the aircraft on the ground with no undue delay. We [advised ATC] and asked for CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) to meet us to check for anything out of the ordinary upon landing. We initiated a high speed descent and approach; and performed a safe landing. CFR met the aircraft and checked it over and we taxied to the gate.,B737-800 First Officer reported a flight deck fumes event during cruise.  The crew ran the appropriate QRH checklist and continued to destination.

As we were monitoring the fuel gauges; Flight Attendant called to advise a passenger noticed fluid coming out of the right wing after takeoff. Captain was able to balance the fuel.After established in cruise for about 10 min; started to notice another fuel imbalance in progress. Captain ran FUEL LEAK QRH and noted time and fuel quantities. Got to a fuel imbalance of 650 pounds within 20 min.At this point Captain and I concurred that it looked like we had a fuel leak. Advised ATC of the situation and requested to divert to ZZZ1. Continued and finished QRH checklist. Performed an engine shutdown followed by a single engine landing.,B737 flight crew reported a fuel leak required an in flight shut down of an engine and a diversion.

Followed ECAM checklist and contacted Dispatch to discuss option. Determined it best to continue to ZZZ. We advised ATC and landed on Runway XX.It was an unforeseen event that was handled according to company passengers and policies.,A319 flight crew reported loss of Blue System hydraulic pressure and quantity resulted in a precautionary landing.

On approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ; after calling for the landing gear down and flaps 15; we noticed that we had three green and three red landing gear indications. The overhead panel showed three green indications. We were able to complete the QRH and Landing Checklist and determined that the landing gear was down and locked. We continued the approach with the intention of landing. At approximately 500 feet AGL; we received the oral warning 'TOO LOW GEAR.'I was no longer sure that the landing gear was down and locked.  I called for the go-around and executed the go-around procedure.  We decided to leave the landing gear down and cleaned the flaps up to 5 degrees.  The Captain was working the radios and informed ATC of the go-around.  ATC gave us a heading and cleared us to 2;000 feet. They asked for the reason of the go-around. The Captain informed them that we were having landing gear indication problems. The Captain then decided to request priority handling.We completed the QRH and were able to get three green indications without red indications. The Captain informed ATC we had solved the problem and could continue for another approach and landing.  ATC assigned us Runway XXL.  We set up the FMC; re-briefed the approach; completed all of the appropriate checklists; flew the approach; and landed uneventfully on Runway XXL.  We taxied to the gate; shut down the engines and completed the Shut Down Checklist. While at the gate we had realized that due to workload; we had forgotten to inform the flight attendants of the priority handling situation.To prevent this from happening again; we need to slow down; and complete all briefings to the Flight Attendants and Passenger cabin prior to landing. Just because we were able to solve the landing gear problem and workload was heavy; does not alleviate the duty to inform the Cabin Crew.,B737-700 First Officer reported a landing gear indication issue during approach resulting in a go-around.  The flight crew ran the QRH procedures; resolved the issues and landed safely on their second attempt.

All engine parameters indicated normal. PM (Pilot Monitoring) briefed the Flight Attendants and made a PA to the passengers explaining what happened.  Approximately 3 minutes later we had an indication of N2 overspeed (~103%). PF (Pilot Flying) reduced thrust on the engine to bring it within normal limits which was immediately followed by a ENG 1 FUEL CNTRL FAULT. FO (First Officer) continued to fly the airplane while CA (Captain) was completing the ECAM procedure. The ECAM procedure directed the ENG 1 to be shut down. PF notified ATC and requested vectors to final approach for Runway XXL. PM completed the ECAM procedure and the QRH follow up for the ENG FAIL. PM briefed the Flight Attendants on a Precautionary Landing according to the Non Routine Landing Considerations. PM conducted a PA to the passengers to explain the situation and to expect ARFF (Aircraft Rescue & Fire Fighting) to check the airplane on the outside. We were cleared for a visual approach to Runway XXL which we backed up with the ILS. PF conducted a normal approach and landing and stopped the aircraft on the runway short of Taxiway D.  PM requested that the Fire Commander check the outside of the aircraft for any damage or leaks. After ARFF inspected the aircraft and reported no signs of damage or leaks we taxied to the gate.  After arriving at the gate; we called Dispatch to notify them of the precautionary landing.  Dispatch patched us through to Maintenance Control.  We discussed the ECAM / engine indications with Maintenance to aid in the log discrepancy write up.,A319 flight crew reported engine compressor stall during descent.

Complied with STAB OUT OF TRIM QRH procedure.  Maintenance notified via ACARS. Descending with autopilot and autothrottle on; aircraft did not level off at the preselected 4;000 feet.  I disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and began to return to 4;000 feet.  I tried the electric trim and found it to be inoperative.  I notified the Captain of the inoperative electric trim.  The Captain tried his electric trim and also found it to be inoperative. Captain conferred with me about disconnecting the STAB TRIM CUT OUT switches.  I agreed and the STAB TRIM CUT OUT switches were disconnected.  Captain opened the QRH and we complied with the STAB OUT OF TRIM QRH procedure.  The STAB OUT OF TRIM QRH procedure directed us to the STABILIZER TRIM INOPERATIVE procedure; which we complied with.  I tried to operate the manual trim with my left hand could not move the trim wheel through a full rotation.  I notified the Captain of this and he tried the manual trim.  Captain seem to require both hands to operate the manual trim.  Captain notified ATC and we requested delay vectors. We requested the longer Runway of XXR.  We performed a flaps 15 landing on XXR.  Descended below assigned altitude of 4;000 feet due to malfunctioning elevator trim.,B737-900 flight crew reported Stab Trim failure resulted in an altitude overshoot and limited control ability.

When cleared for takeoff; pushed power to approximate 40% then selected TO/GA. As the thrust levers advanced; there was a very loud bang and yaw to the left. We had just started rolling. The thrust levers were brought to idle and we stopped on the runway. Initially; with the bang and yaw I thought we hit something or ran over something. As I was looking out the window; the First Officer stated we had a #1 Engine failure. Tower asked if we wanted equipment. We asked if they saw smoke or damage; and they replied 'No'; along with another aircraft on the taxiway. I made a PA for everyone to remain seated. I then called the F/A's (Flight Attendants) and asked them to look at the Captain side engine for smoke or flames. They reported it looked normal. We ran the Engine Failure Checklist; and discussed running the Rejected Takeoff Checklist. Since the event happened as the aircraft had just started to roll (probably less than 10 knots) we didn't run the Rejected Takeoff Checklist; knowing that brake energy and cooling wouldn't be an issue. After we taxied to the gate; I made calls to Dispatch; Maintenance; and the Chief Pilot on call; while the First Officer went to the ramp to inspect the aircraft. He discovered bent and broken turbine blades with metal pieces loose in the engine. He came back upstairs and called ZZZ Ground to do a runway check for engine debris. I made a PA to the passengers explaining that we had an engine failure at power up; and the aircraft would be taken out of service. They would receive more flight information in the terminal. After the passengers had deplaned; the crew got together and debriefed the event. I informed the F/As of what had happened and let them ask questions.,Captain reported engine failure on take off roll causing a rejected take off and a return to the gate.

At that point we heard a very loud bang followed by a hard left yawing motion. The PF (Pilot Flying) immediately retarded the throttles to idle; and applied smooth breaking; which brought us to a complete stop.  We were angled left by about 30-40 degrees in relation to the center line of Runway 4; just prior to taxiway. I immediately informed ATC that we had stopped on the runway; the PF informed the PAX (passengers) to stay seated.  At that point we began to assess the situation. Initially we thought it was a blown tire or nose wheel steering issue. In that moment of assessing I noticed the #1 Engine Fail Caution illuminate in the #1 EGT Gauge. I informed the PF of the indication. It was the only indication we saw. No fire; no red lines only the engine failure alert caution. We reviewed the Rejected Takeoff Procedure; completed the QRH for Engine Failure. We then assessed the rolling and breaking capability of the aircraft and we found it to be normal.  We got clearance to exit the runway and return to the gate. As we pulled in to the gate; we remembered that we had not run an After Landing Checklist and quickly completed that; followed by the Parking Checklist. Then; the jetbridge malfunctioned and we had to wait until Airport Ops came to fix it. Once the jetbridge was attached I exited the aircraft to inspect Engine #1. I found the N1 fan blades and the stators directly behind them to be in a normal appearance. When I looked into the tailpipe of the turbine section; I found metal debris from the engine and both the aft fan blades and stators in front of them to be damaged and missing pieces. I hustled back to the Flight Deck to inform Ground Control that they needed to do a FOD check of the runway as we had; had and engine failure and that they needed to check for small engine parts.,First Officer reported engine failure on take off roll; resulting in engine damage and a return to the gate.

Student Captain was Pilot flying for this leg. Shortly after Takeoff the PF commented that his electric trim switch was not working and asked me to try mine; which also did not work. I asked him if the elevator was working and he replied that it was and felt normal. We asked ATC to level off at 12;000 ft to work on a flight control issue and was approved. We did not ask for priority handling at this time...we engaged the A Autopilot successfully but shortly after the 'STAB OUT OF TRIM' light came on. As we began to look up the appropriate Non-normal; the PF disengaged the autopilot and tried to manually trim the stabilizer. Although he was successful it looked like it was difficult to rotate so I asked to give it a shot to feel the force required to rotate. The force required to rotate was abnormally high but did provide results and we were flying a trimmed aircraft at 240 knots. By now I was considering that a Jammed Flight Control (the stabilizer in this case) was the source of our STAB OUT OF TRIM  problem. So the first checklist we addressed was the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls Non-normal and also the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls procedure (the script/expanded explanation). Around this time we requested priority handling with ATC because checklist called for landing at nearest suitable airport. We were hoping that we might get electric trim back when moving STAB TRIM switch on pedestal to OVERRIDE. Did not happen. Called Dispatch with Maintenance Control on the line hoping for some systems expertise. Ended call with where we started. We began to discuss possible value of running STAB OUT OF TRIM checklist. We did. But before doing so we noted the hazard of running multiple checklists and capped our STAB TRIM OVERRIDE switch to normal. The Jammed Flight Control non normal resulted in moving both STAB  TRIM switches to CUTOUT but also called for landing at nearest suitable with Flaps 15. About this time we got on radio again with Maintenance Control; Dispatch and also the Flight Operations. Our hope was that Flight Operations might be able to get a Hydraulics of Flight Controls Maintenance expert on with us. We discussed both checklists and Flight Operations talked about the potential effect of slower speeds. This call ended with general consensus we were on the best track and we discussed whether to land sooner or burn down to below Max landing weight. Because we felt the aircraft was stable and our condition was not likely to get worse we chose to burn fuel. I talked to PF and told him it would be prudent for me to do landing since that would be his first one from left seat in aircraft. We briefed our arrival plan which included our trim plan as we reduced airspeed and extended gear and flaps. As we descended and slowed we reminded ATC of need for priority handling equipment. Only significant thing to report was that by the time we had fully configured and slowed to final approach speed it was extremely difficult to trim manually. In fact; with one pilot exerting maximum effort; you could maybe get the manual strection about a quarter turn. All of this led us to believe that the Stabilizer was DEFINITELY jammed. Landed uneventfully; had equipment check us out then taxied to gate. Flight Attendants were given TEST brief and told there was no need to prepare for evacuation.,B737 NG flight crew reported a jammed horizontal stabilizer trim system and elected to make an Air turn Back and precautionary landing.

There was not any smoke nor fire; just an odor. We notified ATC; turned back toward ZZZ; accomplished all checklist items; and landed uneventfully. After clearing the runway; we had the fire department check the airplane for signs of a fire. They saw nothing so we taxied back to the gate. At the gate; the fire department came on board to check the galley. They found nothing. No deviations from FARs.,A320 flight crew reported an 'electrical burning smell' during initial climb resulting in a return to the departure airport.

After consulting with Dispatch and Maintenance Control about continuing the flight with this advisory a decision was made to divert to ZZZ. The decision to divert was made prior to ZZZZZ Intersection. In order to facilitate a direct routing to ZZZ; we requested priority handling with ATC. After this decision was made the oil pressure began to deteriorate; it reached the point where the ECAM low oil pressure procedure activated. We complied with the ECAM procedure and shut the engine down. Advised ATC the we were changing our status to a priority handling aircraft; and advised Dispatch of the engine shutdown; with their concurrence we continued to ZZZ and made an overweight landing. A gradual descent from cruise altitude was flown while we complied with ECAM; QRH and company procedures. This gradual descent and landing at ZZZ also facilitated a landing closer to maximum landing weight.,A319 Captain reported receiving a low oil ECAM warning for the Number 2 engine during cruise.  The crew followed QRH procedures and decided to shut the engine down and divert to the nearest suitable airport.

We entered the clouds on descent and activated the engine anti ice system. Once level for a few minutes at 300 I noticed a rapid drop of airspeed on my side. I pushed the throttles up and informed the Captain. At that point we realized we had unreliable airspeed on the First Officer side. The Captain assumed control of the aircraft. We had encountered a small amount of rime icing and decided to climb back up. At this point we also realized the Captains altimeter was off. We [advised] through ATC; ran the QRC and QRH checklists. We diverted to ZZZ. We advised Dispatch and the flight attendants of our situation. Passing 15;000 feet our instruments began to return to normal and were equal upon landing.  We also accomplished they overweight landing checklist. We landed at ZZZ without incident. I believe the icing conditions could have contributed to the event. Check the pitot static system. Or computers. We had no indication of any heat malfunction.,B737-800 flight crew reported icing conditions resulted in unreliable airspeed indications; followed by a descent and diversion to a precautionary landing.

MSL out of ZZZ; we experienced two VERY loud bangs from the #2 engine. We immediately suspected a compressor stall. Scanning the engines; I noticed the #2 engine decreasing in RPM. I immediately pulled the #2 engine to idle and it stabilized there. We coordinated a level-off at 9000 ft. with ZZZ Departure and flew an extended downwind. We ran all appropriate checklists and determined that the engine appeared to be performing normally. Following the checklist; we pushed the power up on the effected engine to approximately 80% with no adverse indications; there was no need to push it up any further. No [priority handling was requested] and we elected to return to ZZZ and fly a flaps 15 approach and landing to Runway 28R. Flight Attendants and Passengers were advised of the situation. After all checklist items were complete; we accomplished an uneventful approach and landing. Weight or brake energy was not a factor.,B737 flight crew reported compressor stalls during climb and elected to return to the departure airport.

We arrived in the flight deck and performed all the normal procedures we have for a normal push back. Captain did the preflight walk around and I loaded the FMC. We agreed the OFP (Operational Flight Plan) looked good and the rest of the flight plan looked sufficient for a potentially bumpy ride to ZZZ1. Captain advised to Flight Attendants to stay seated out of ZZZ until we knew the ride would allow for their safe duties. I was the flying pilot and after Captain did his first flight of the day and PM (Pilot Monitoring) duty brief; I briefed the SID. We planned for a normal pushback with 2 engine start for a quick taxi for departure. We performed the BEFORE TAKEOFF CHECKLIST on taxi out down the ramp for takeoff on runway XX.While we were taxiing down to runway XX; I noticed there was a split between the L and R duct pressure. I made note of it to Captain and we briefly discussed these splits we have seen before in this aircraft and recall it being a known normal occurrence. I cycled the L PACK (Left) switch to OFF and back to AUTO as well as the ISOLATION VALVE switch to OPEN and AUTO and saw the duct pressure needles sync together. We decided it would be a safe action to depart and noted we would keep an eye on the duct pressure and pressurization.We departed runway XX and CLIMBED VIA THE SID. I hand flew the departure to the mid 20s and then turned the autopilot on. I noted Captain mentioned 2 different times that the aircraft was pressurizing normally though the duct pressure still was split. The ride was mostly good and the flight attendants were up but the seat belt was still on. As we approached our level off altitude of FL340 the CABIN ALTITUDE horn and the MASTER WARNING lights illuminated. We verified the CABIN ALTITUDE was high on the pressurization panel and performed the Immediate Action items for CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING OR RAPID DEPRESSURIZATION/EMERGENCY DESCENT. The CABIN ALTITUDE was not controllable; and we continued with the descent. There was a definite issue with immediate communication over the inter-phone with the masks on and all the noise. Getting the mask on and the audio panel correct to be able to speak and hear over the speaker poses a threat in this airplane if not practiced. We were able to communicate with each other and ATC but it was challenging with all the noise and distractions.Captain identified as a priority flight with ZZZ Center and we began the initial descent over the mountains. I initially turned off the AUTOPILOT to pitch over and begin the procedure. Once we were established in a descent; I turned the AUTOPILOT back on and descended to FL190 with the high terrain in mind. We saw an aircraft below us on the TCAS and had to shallow the descent initially before we were cleared lower. Captain proceeded with completing the checklist and communicating with the Flight attendants; passengers; and dispatch. Descending through approximately 16;000 feet I noticed the CABIN ALTITUDE was in a normal range of around 7;000 feet and we took off the oxygen masks. We leveled off at 11000 in the vicinity of ZZZ2. Initially we were planning on diverting to ZZZ2 because we were so close; but Captain's experience and familiarity with ZZZ3. This led to the decision to divert and there was difficulty communicating with dispatch possibly due to our low altitude so we opted to landing in ZZZ3. The flight attendants and passengers were all briefed for the diversion to ZZZ3. I left the AUTOPILOT on and we flew the RNAV (GPS) Runway XY 29 approach and landing. All checklists were completed before ZZZZZ intersection and the landing was normal. CFR ( Aircraft Rescue & Firefighting) was there upon arrival.We were parked at the hard stand in ZZZ3 and the ramp personnel brought over the ramp to allow the passengers to vacate the aircraft. Operations were there to help while we figured out the plan of action for the passengers. Captain discussed the situation with the ChiefPilot; Dispatch; and Maintenance and I aided the flight attendants with passengers. I walked to the OUTFLOW VALVE and noted a mesh substance blocking the OUTFLOW VALVE from fully closing. Captain manually opened and closed the valve and I videoed the movement.,First Officer reported an emergency descent and diversion followed by a precautionary landing caused by Foreign Object Debris blocking the outflow valve from operation.

Start; taxi and takeoff were uneventful.  Shortly after reaching cruise altitude of FL280; we noticed a low oil qty (0%) and dropping oil pressure (approximately psi). I called for QRH and Captain began running Low Oil Pressure Checklist.  While accomplishing the checklist; the oil pressure dropped below 15 psi and entered the Warning (Red) regime.  This drove us to shutdown the #1 engine.  Captain advised ATC and a gradual descent to FL 250 was initially begun.  After the shutdown was completed; we elected to begin diverting to ZZZ1 as it was only 50 miles away.  ATC; Flight Attendants and dispatch were all provided with necessary information to assist us as we requested Rwy XXL; but due to heavy traffic and closure of XXC; ATC requested we use XXR.  Landing data was run by both crew and dispatch and stopping distance was sufficient on the shorter runway.  While descending; I was momentarily distracted by the runway change and while simultaneously slowing to 200 kts Inattention caused us to slow to approximately 189 kts and we received an 'Airspeed Low' warning.  I accelerated back to 210 kts and requested Flaps 5.  We executed a normal approach and landing with 5 extra kts of speed due to a '10 kts of gain' on final report.  Once we landed; we exited the runway and requested Fire Chief to check us out.  After receiving the all clear; we taxied uneventfully to the gate and accomplished all checklists.  All events were debriefed in accordance with company debrief card.,B737 flight crew reports inflight shutdown and airspeed low warning in descent.

We advised ATC with clearance to descend as requested to FL200 (FL223 max single engine altitude capability).  Drift down profile initiated while concurrently performing required checklists; balancing fuel as needed as checklist directed engine shutdown.  Declared ZZZ as the nearest suitable divert at point in time. Notified dispatch of intent for ZZZ; as well as coordinating communications with the Purser and making a PA to the passengers.  Obtained ZZZ ATIS which stated winds variable at 6 kts landing Runway XX. Requested Runway XY for additional runway length.  Transitioned from drift down profile to a descent profile when a 3:1 profile attained. As we approached within 15 nm of the field; we were informed that winds were gusting in excess of 20 kts from the south.  We coordinated a runway change to XXL and at approximately 10-12 nm north of the field executed a left 360 degree turn descending to the sector MVA as to scrub altitude due to the much shortened landing distance to Runway XXL.Approach and landing was uneventful as was the taxi evolution to the gate for parking.  Fire crash and rescue followed and informed that there was no threat heat signature emanating from the landing gear/brake assemblies. Normal passenger deplaning ensued.ATC throughout the evolution was perfect in every respect in aiding the successful uneventful outcome.  A discrete frequency was assigned and that was immeasurably valuable.,B737 flight crew reported an engine inflight shutdown in cruise due to an oil filter bypass issue.

No odor in rest of cabin. No odor detected in flight deck. Asked FA to check lav; overhead bins; galley carts and storage areas. Nothing was found. Began getting data for landing in ZZZ1. Began referencing QRH for smoke procedure and overweight landing procedure. FO (First Officer) assumed Pilot Flying duties and ATC. FA (flight attendant) then informed us that occupants were becoming ill. We immediately notified ATC and requested diversion to ZZZ1. Informed ATC we had injuries. Sent ACARS to Dispatch advising of diversion. During descent completed QRH Overweight Landing procedure and began Smoke/Avionics Smoke/Fumes QRH 17-1 procedure. Stopped Smoke procedure while maneuvering for approach and assumed Pilot Flying duties. Uneventful overweight landing. Stopped aircraft on runway and called FA's to assess. Was notified that the odor had stopped. Requested taxi to gate. Taxied per ATC instructions to ramp. Ramp unaware of our condition and asked us to hold on the ramp. Attempted contact with Operations. No answer. Ramp was able to obtain gate information from company and cleared us to gate. Fire truck followed us to gate and fireman came onboard and said all was clear outside of aircraft. Requested paramedics. Waited for over 15 minutes to arrive. FA 3 and several passengers were ill and required treatment. Informed that odor had completely subsided. Passengers remained onboard to allow access for paramedics as ill occupants were blocking front galley area and jetbridge. Flight Attendants were very assertive in communicating the specifics of the odors and location including the condition of our passengers throughout the event. This played a significant role in understanding the condition in the cabin and making proper decisions. Odor events can be difficult to prevent. Preparing for these seemingly inevitable challenges can make them easier to manage.,"A321 flight crew reported a dirty sock"" odor was detected in the cabin during cruise resulting in a diversion."""

Was cleared to descend via ZZZZZ 2 RNAV arrival on [Runway] XXR. Prior to ZZZZZ; at approximately FL220 during descent; noticed that the cabin altitude was at 8;300 feet and increasing. I called attention to the First Officer that we might be losing cabin pressurization. The Pressurization screen on ECAM was displayed and noticed that both the inlet and extract valve were fully closed but the safety valve had opened.Since we had already been cleared to descend via ZZZZZ arrival and had an altitude of 12;000 set in the MCP I decided to expedite the descent to see if I could control the rate of ascent in the cabin. At approximately FL180 it appeared that we could not control the rate of ascent in the cabin and that at its present rate the cabin would exceed 10;000 feet shortly. I then [advised] with ATC and requested 10;000 feet which was granted. I advised the Lead Flight Attendant that we were experiencing cabin pressurization problems but to expect a normal landing. As we leveled at 10;000 feet I monitored the cabin and noticed that it had climbed to 12;000 feet but stabilized. It took several minutes before the cabin normalized at our cruise altitude of 10;000 feet. I asked the First Officer  to see if he could find an applicable checklist to run. During this time I maintained control of the aircraft and communicated with ATC. The First Officer advised that he was able to manually control the outflow valve and that the checklist recommended shallow descents thereafter. I continued to ask for delayed vectors from ATC just north of ZZZ as the First Officer and I reviewed the state of the aircraft and decided it was safe to proceed with the landing. I asked ATC for shallow descents on the arrival to [Runway] XXR into ZZZ. The landing and taxi in were uneventful.,Air carrier Captain reported malfunctioning pressurization system on descent.

Flight was completely full in the cabin. Due to Pack #2 being inoperative it was difficult to cool the main cabin temp using only Pack #1. Using only Pack #1 at FL370 we were able to maintain 72 degrees in the cabin using max cold and high flow. Approximately 200 nm west of ZZZ at FL370 we received an ECAM AIR PACK 1+2 FAULT. ATC was notified and [priority handling was requested]. Upon checking the pressurization and bleed air page; it appeared that Pack #1 was overheating showing an output temperature in amber yet we never received a Pack 1 OVHT ECAM. The cabin altitude was still under control. A descent to 10;000 ft. was initiated without exceeding the cabin altitude before we complied with the ECAM to turn off Pack #1 leaving us unpressurized. Contact was made with Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss the situation resulting in a diversion to ZZZ.,Air Carrier Pilot Crew reported departing with one air cycle machine inoperative and during cruise flight the other air cycle machine indicated a fault condition necessitating a diversion.

Within 10 minutes of departure flight attendants report water tank was down to 70% and lavatory sinks had no water coming out. Within 25 minutes of departure tank was empty. We called Dispatch and Maintenance. Decision was made to return to ZZZ. Overweight landing was made because we had no idea where the water was leaking to and we did not want to expose ourselves to compounding failures. Advised ATC due to overweight landing. Landing was uneventful.

Inbound to ZZZ; deviating west of the arrival due to a severe TS over ZZZZZ and also another TS touching ZZZZZ1 along with multiple significant CB radar returns just west of our direct line to ZZZZZ1.  We checked in with ZZZ Center and descended to or level at FL340. We were made aware that our deviation west of the arrival was causing the Controller difficulty in de-conflicting our descent due to departing traffic which was below us and to my understanding west of us.  Very busy controller with no time to discuss options.  I was approaching the west edge (absolutely as close as possible) of the last significant CB when the Controller told us in an excited tone to turn right 15 degrees and descent to FL280 (or maybe 240; I don't recall now).  The CB was about 4 mile ahead and 2 miles across in both directions and 15 degrees right would put us straight through the middle of it.  I started an immediate right and tried to ask my First Officer to tell the Controller we had to have farther right; but he saw me turning and read back the 15 degree instruction.  The Controller was immediately on to two or three other calls.  I asked my First Officer to tell the Controller the heading that we needed to fly and about then the Controller noticed that we had turned a bit extra and shouted at us because apparently another aircraft was departing in the corridor between the last CB and the big TS.  I immediately corrected back and flew through the middle of the CB I was trying to avoid which was where the Controller wanted us in the first place.  I also paused my descent very briefly to verify with the Controller that we were going to be safe still and we agreed on a heading of north as we passed directly through the cell.  Fortunately; despite passing though the small cell with a solid yellow return; there was no significant turbulence and no injuries.  I don't believe we caused loss of separation and my intention was to coordinate and return to the desired heading as soon as possible. The frequency was too busy; departures probably should have been pushed farther west; I was trying to comply with the Controller's guidance as best I could while not creating a dangerous turbulence situation for my flight attendants and passengers.  The B737-8 MAX radar might be overly sensitive.  Had the Controller asked 30 seconds sooner we would have had time to coordinate; or a minute later we could have taken any heading.  In retrospect; we should have said we were unable to turn for another 6 miles; but given the urgency in the Controller's voice; I thought I was doing the right thing.Whenever an airplane is cleared to deviate for weather and is operating around thunderstorms and significant CBs; it seems like the Controller should always ask if you can accept a turn; not just assign a heading into the direction of the things we are avoiding.  Also; if there is any way to make these frequencies less congested; that would help also.  And finally; the other company's aircraft was apparently flying outbound and closer to our assigned arrival than we were comfortable with flying inbound.  Maybe ZZZ Center should develop and publish alternate Departure and Arrivals that could be assigned for weather avoidance as widespread thunderstorms are so common in this area.,Air carrier First Officer reported a weather deviation was required but the very busy ATC controller was unable to accommodate the request. A heading deviation and airborne conflict may have resulted.

As soon as the turn was initiated a loud bang was heard from below and behind the cockpit. The noise then went away. A few moments later FA (Flight Attendant) 1 called up and reported a loud banging noise from 2R. There were no ECAM or any other indications in the cockpit - all displays were normal - nor was the noise audible from the cockpit. After getting the airplane stabilized and the after-takeoff checks completed; I sent the FO (First Officer) back to investigate. It was confirmed that a loud banging was obvious in the cabin. A return to the field was planned; ATC notified; [priority handling was requested]; FA's briefed for a precautionary landing; Dispatch notified and CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) requested. Runway XY was requested as this was an overweight landing; and the QRH procedure was followed. A smooth landing followed; the aircraft was brought to a stop after clearing Runway XY and the airplane inspected by CFR crew. The comment was that; 'A door was missing.' No other damage noted; and the flight taxied to a gate uneventfully. A walk-around revealed the 2R slide door departed the aircraft; followed by the slide. The noise was from the inflation supply line which was banging against the fuselage and wing root. A write-up for the missing door and raft was entered into the log along with the overweight landing notes. [The cause can be found through] perhaps confirmation of all maintenance items accomplished during the inspection at ZZZ immediately previous to this event. [I suggest to find the] determination of why the slide/raft door failed and [to find] appropriate remedies [to be] taken to preclude future issues.,A321 flight crew reported a loud bang followed by repetitive banging aft of the cockpit door and elected to perform an air turnback where it was discovered that a slide and slide door had departed the aircraft.

Initially; we considered a landing gear tire might have blown or it was retraction problem due to gear in transit timed with [another] problem. Once gear was fully retracted; a series of bangs and shutters occurred again and during our global assessment (Nothing displayed on ECAM); we noted a spike in temperature on engine 1 EGT as corresponding to the problem. [We suspected] compressor stalls. Reducing the power on engine 1 to idle eliminated the problem and the engine ran normally. We immediately [requested priority handling] with ATC requesting the ARFF equipment; as well as a box pattern back to XXR (longest runway); leveled at 4000 feet MSL; maintained configuration at 180 knots. We ran all appropriate checklists including: Engine 1 Stall in flight with Engine Parameters Normal at Idle; Non-Routine Landing; and Overweight Landing. We made an initial and landing imminent announcement to the flight attendants and passengers. During the initial series of compressor stalls and after the engine was stabilized at idle neither the flight attendants nor any passengers reported any other engine problems such as fire; smoke; vibrations; etc. Once everything was complete we flew the ILS XXC approach to a normal touchdown and landed to a full stop on the runway so that ARFF could look over the aircraft before we taxied uneventfully to the gate. Weight at touchdown was 3;000 to 4;000 pounds over the max with a 200 FPM touchdown. After shutdown; we made 2 logbook entries (Compressor stall after TO and Overweight Landing). We debriefed the Chief Pilot; Maintenance; ARFF Chief; Gate Agent; and Passengers. We saved all paper work; photos; and contact information.An Airbus Pilot jump-seater was very helpful with event CRM. Possible failure factors included heavy weight; TOGA takeoff; and a warm day stressing the engine. In addition; APU had been on MEL for 8 days adding to engine fatigue and stress with ground air and cross-bleed starts; and it was the aircraft's first flight of the day (even with ample warm-up time). Following policies; procedures; flows; and checklists all while maintaining positive aircraft control in an un-rushed manner using all available resources and thorough CRM led to a safe resolution to the engine failure on takeoff. [I recommend] better and more prompt APU maintenance; and the use of non-TOGA flex takeoffs on longer runways in hot and heavy takeoffs situations.,A321 flight crew reported a possible compressor stall on the number 1 engine shortly after takeoff which resulted in a return to the departure airport.

We communicated with each other as a crew and confirmed that all inflight [Cabin Attendants] (F1;F2;F3;F4) detected the fumes. The intensity was a Level 2: Moderate. During this phase my symptoms were the following: burning eyes; nose and throat. Flight deck was notified. After deplaning the fumes and my symptoms dissipated. Maintenance came on board and decided we would continue our next flight with same aircraft. On Aircraft X ZZZ to ZZZ1 during boarding when engines were turned on I immediately detected the oily burning fumes that were now at a Level 3: Strong since customers began to complain as well. The location started initially in the AFT of the aircraft but during deplaning was detectable throughout entire aircraft. The source was the same which was the air vents. The phase was during boarding on the ground. Flight deck was notified and they determined we had to deplane all customers. Myself and F4 were experiencing more severe symptoms. I experienced symptoms of burning eyes; nose and throat once again. I also began to feel tightness in my chest; difficulty breathing; thickness in the air; slight disoriented; and minor speech problems. Due to my symptoms I felt as though I was unable to perform my inflight duties safely. [Medical staff] was contacted when off the aircraft. Myself and the F4 were sent to the hospital.,A320 Flight Attendant crew reported a fume event during boarding resulting in flight delay/cancellation.

After reaching clean-up altitude I called the cabin and the FA's reported passengers seeing flames and sparks coming from the right engine; as well as hearing popping noises. The FA's reported the entire cabin lit up brightly; but that there was no smoke in the cabin. We informed ATC that we had a #2 engine fire; were returning for landing; and requested fire truck assistance. We had no cockpit indications of a fire or malfunction. Both engines were producing symmetric power and operating normally; according to our gauges. Upon landing and shutting down the engines on Taxiway XX; Fire Rescue took temperature readings and reported them in the normal range. We were towed to the gate.,B737-700 flight crew reported an engine fire that was noticed by the passengers during takeoff and performed an air turnback.

We were under PTOW (Planned Takeoff Weight) and good winds and temperatures. Normal taxi and checklist to [runway] XXC. Cleared for takeoff; CA sets TOGA. Normal acceleration Vr. Shortly after Vr; heard a loud bang - CA (Captain) says; 'I think we blew a tire.' I said; 'I agree.' CA kept flying; we left the gear down. Speed was bleeding off; and then I said 'engine failure.' [Requested priority handling] with intentions to return to ZZZ. Leveled off at engine acceleration height [and] started to accelerate; thinking the gear was up. We decided to leave the flaps at 1 to return to the field and not knowing if there was any damage. [We] completed the ECAM procedure; follow-ups. CA talked to the FA's (Flight Attendant) to prepare for a precautionary landing and made a PA to the passengers; per the OD pages. ATC asked us to climb to 4;000 ft. Then; we realized the gear was still down. [We] raised the gear [and] completed the after-takeoff checklist. Did the landing approach; overweight landing; and checklist. Briefed the approach to [runway] XXC and descent checklist. Configured on schedule; landing checklist; and landed uneventfully. After stopping; the CA made a PA; talked to ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting); then taxed to the gate.[The cause was a] startle effect and the initial confusion of a tire failure or an engine failure. That played a significant role in the distraction of the landing gear. [I suggest to] do a max weight V1 in the SIMs.,A321 flight crew reported performing an air turnback after experiencing an engine failure on takeoff.

A few seconds later another call from the flight attendant said the cabin now has the strong odor and a passenger said there is a haze. We notified ATC and were cleared direct to ZZZ. We had a thunderstorm between us and the field; so this required some deviations. We elected not to don the mask because we didn't have smoke or odor in the cockpit. We briefly talked about it and didn't want the added condition. We also decided that we would don the mask at first sign of smell or smoke. Things obviously were very busy because we made it from 36;000 [feet] to the Runway in 18 minutes. By the time we were pointed in the right direction we started to run the Smoke Fire Fumes Checklist but never finished it. We were very tired from the multiple reroutes; PM trip to an AM; back to a PM. I elected not to finish the checklist because I wanted all eyes up so we could get the aircraft on the ground safely. On approach we also had a bird strike; which was a non-event and we landed 10;500 pounds overweight; also a non-event. After we cleared the runway we had the fire trucks shoot the brakes; and after we ran the brake cooling numbers found that we could taxi to the gate.,B737-700 Captain reported a fume event during cruise resulted in a diversion.

I was on standby from XA:00am-XG:00 on Date in ZZZ. Crew Scheduling called me at XF:06 to work a 1-2-1 three day trip. They assigned me position 1 and the first leg of the trip was to ZZZ1. I switched positions with Name and became the #3 because I don't like being #1. While walking to the gate flight service called to check on us (they thought they were calling the #1 from the original crew but instead called me by accident) and informed me that the original crew was being taken off this trip due to a fume event. When we arrived at the gate; our flight had begun deplaning. We were told that they had sat out on the tarmac for 2 hours before they were able to get to the gate and deplane so the aircraft could be checked out. During deplaning; Name 1 (the #4) and Name 2 (the #2) called the union and Name 3 to talk to them because we were very nervous about flying on this aircraft after it just came back to the gate and had to have us re-crew it due to a fume event. We did not know the original crew personally but as they deplaned they warned Name 2 and Name 1 that we should not get on that aircraft because something was wrong with it and that they were on the way to the hospital. They were shaken up; pale; and were visibly ill. One of the girls even had to get a wheelchair to wheel her out of the terminal. I immediately felt very unsafe about proceeding forward on this trip. Seeing the crew so visibly ill from a fume event and then being expected to take that aircraft right back out and move on like nothing happened is extremely terrifying and irresponsible of the flight deck. Our health and safety clearly was not a first priority in this instance. After original crew and passengers deplaned we were immediately sent down to the aircraft and the agent wanted us to check our equipment so we could board again and get this flight out as quickly as possible since it was so delayed. I was the first FA on the jet bridge; and I ran into the maintenance man on his way out. He told me he did an inspection of the aircraft and it was cleared to fly. He said he could smell stuff in the aft lavs but that everything was clear. He told Name 2 when he saw her that it was all good and to not get on and break anything. This was all happening so fast that it was hard to process it all and I was very uneasy and felt pressure to work this flight. After I got on the flight; the Captain was dismissive of the event. He informed me that he thought the previous crew was being overly cautious because two of the four flight attendants had just recently been through an incident on one of their trips that they had not been able to fully recover from; so that is why they turned around; but he did not think there was a serious issue to be concerned with. I interpreted this as the Captain thinking the previous crew was overreacting and that he did not take their concerns seriously. He and the First Officer said they attributed the fumes to there being a lot of aircraft congestion on the way out and that they thought it would be fine this time around. They said to let them know if we experienced anything this time; but it seemed as though the flight was going no matter what based on the flight deck's attitude. They continued to dismiss our fears before boarding started again saying it was fine to fly on this aircraft and that maintenance didn't see a problem. I was hesitant with this news because maintenance was on their way out not even 5-10 minutes after deplaning took place; and I did not think that was a substantial amount of time to do a thorough check of the aircraft. After the Captain informed me of this; my other crew members got on board and they asked me what he said. Name 2 was especially nervous because she has a health concern that if mixed with a fume event could be life threatening; so she went into the cockpit and had a long talk with the Captain. I'm not exactly sureof what he said to her because I was out of earshot but she told me he was dismissive and also mentioned what he said to me about the other 2 flight attendants from the other crew being overly cautious due to their past experiences on a trip. Name 2 told me that the Captain also made a joke when she expressed her concerns about how his mother thought he was the smartest guy in the world but there is always a chance that I'm wrong. We re-boarded passengers on the flight without there being a substantial amount of time to pass after it was deplaned the first time (like 15-20 minutes). During boarding; passengers kept asking me if it was safe to fly; and I told them that the Captain had told me he thought it was due to congestion from other aircraft that caused the smell the first time and that maintenance had cleared us to fly. The Captain never once made an announcement to the passengers to update them on the situation and reassure passengers once they re-boarded. Name 1 called Name 3 during boarding and asked Name 1 to ask the Captain if he had filled out the cabin odor fume report. Name 1 called me since he was in the back to ask. Name 2 had come to the front during boarding and she ended up being the one to ask the Captain. The Captain's response was that he had never heard of the cabin odor fume report before. There was another report that the union wanted us to ask about (the report is named with numerics) and when Name 2 asked the Captain about this he said he was going to pull it up but we never actually saw him do it. He then changed the subject with Name 2 to talk about his vacation that he was going on at the end of the trip. I had COVID back in Month and ever since I recovered; my taste and smell have not returned; so I am not a good judge on if there was an odor in this aircraft. However; Name 1 and Name 2 mentioned they smelled something gross in the back of the aircraft. Once in the air; Name 1 and I started feeling very light headed. Name 1 and the #1 Name 2 also started having a bad headache. During the middle of the service; there was moderate turbulence that continued the duration of the flight. We ended up having to suspend service because it was too dangerous to be in the aisle. I even felt like I caught some air at one point. We hurried to secure the carts and ourselves in the back. This is not what this report is about; but I think you should know that the Captain did not communicate with us the entire time about the turbulence or when it would end. We had to call him to ask if the turbulence would continue the rest of the flight and if there was a different altitude we could try because we were all feeling whiplashed in the back and queasy. He said we should suspend service and that he would make the announcement to the passengers about it. Name 1 then had to call him about 15 minutes later after the initial call to see if he was still going to make the announcement because he had yet to do it. He finally made the announcement to the passengers that we would not be completing the rest of the service due to the turbulence. However; he called the #1 Name 2 to make sure she had completed first class service because he wanted to make sure the customers were getting what they paid for. The Captain's unprofessionalism and lack of care for the flight attendants and our safety was astounding. Once we landed he and the First Officer were one of the first ones off the aircraft and they left to go straight to the van for their layover. These pilots ran off right when we landed. It was evident that the Captain was in a hurry to start his layover and had no concern for health and safety of his flight crew. He never once checked on us or asked us how we were feeling from the fume event or the turbulence. Now you have at least two flight attendant crews sick and a Captain and First Officer that could care less. Was this airplane truly airworthy? Name 1's headache continued for the next 3 days. On the second day of ourtrip; after we worked from ZZZ1-ZZZ2 Name 1 had to call out because he threw up mid flight; had a horrible headache; and had an upset stomach. He said his symptoms started that first flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1 and only continued. We had to get a standby from ZZZ2 to finish the trip with us. I have felt extremely lethargic ever since that flight. It feels like I took 10 Benadryl. I have had a very foggy brain and have slept non-stop. Writing this report is the longest I have stayed awake since I got home from that trip. I have also had shortness of breath. Name 1 and I went to the ER on Date 3 and got our hemoglobin levels tested and our chest x-rayed. Our hemoglobin levels were normal but that is to be expected since we went 48 hours after exposure. We called out on flight because we felt so sick and unable to fly. I talked to nurse when I called the number and after describing my symptoms she told me she was going to have me stop right there and recommend that I go get checked out at the ER and call her back within the next few days after I was checked out. I am still experiencing extreme brain fog; exhaustion; and shortness of breath. At the end of the day; we felt forced to get on an aircraft that had an issue and work Aircraft X to ZZZ1 because the union told one of the other flight attendants if we didn't we would get in trouble with the company and a refusal to fly. We have been given points against us when we were injured on the workplace in a fume event of some sort and now we are having our jobs jeopardized by points. The points are penalizing us for being sick and being taken to the hospital on a work injury/fume event. Why would a company that I give my time to penalize us for a work related injury? I want to recap that you have 2 crews that are sick with a Captain who was absolutely unprofessional; unsafe; and dismissive. This is a serious safety issue; and with this aircraft still flying you are risking the safety and health of passengers and crew members. Train your pilots and ground staff (the Tower and Ops) on how to handle fume events. We should have never taken this aircraft after knowing that 4 flight attendants were taken to the hospital sick and now we are all sick. At the end of the day; this flight deck crew and the company is responsible for our illnesses. I have not received any calls from our department. It is like no one cares how sick we are. This is my first fume event and I have had no guidance on how to handle this and proceed from here. Communication is key.,Air Carrier Flight Attendant crew reported a fume event during flight which resulted in physiological symptoms.

Right throttle was brought to idle and we ask for a lower altitude. All engine indications at idle were normal. Continued the remainder of the flight with right throttle at idle until beginning the approach. Elected to divert to ZZZ. Once on the approach; advanced right throttle and all indications were normal through the approach and landing.There were no casual factors. Followed SOP.This was a normal flight with no outside factors involved.,A319 flight crew reported an engine compressor stalls in cruise resulting in a diversion.

I immediately went to aft galley to conduct a thorough inspection of all compartments; coffee makers; circuits; closets and under toilet sink. There was no visible fire but there was a faint white haze of smoke in cabin. I proceeded to inform the pilots of our situation that we had also pulled the circuit breakers and he pulled the power to both galleys. At XA18 hours we initiated a rapid descent into ZZZ and landed 17 minutes later XA35 hours.Aircraft was met by [Fire Department] and followed us to the gate for safety measures in case our landing gear or brakes became hot due to overweight landing.Once customers deplaned the Maintenance Technician inspected aircraft and later he stated the re circulation fan under the floor board had charred. [Name] at the [Company Communications System] called me for details of what had occurred and stated we would Dead Head in the morning. Following morning was a an XK30 report with under 8 hours of rest and made to work flight back to ZZZ1.,B737 Flight Attendant reported smoke in the galley during cruise. Flight diverted for a precautionary landing.

Passing through 400 feet AGL immediately after takeoff and upon beginning to execute our assigned heading with a right turn to 155 degrees; the right engine experienced a significant compressor stall with an immediate over temp. The CA (Pilot Flying) immediately applied the appropriate steps to deal with the loss of thrust. I (Pilot Monitoring) immediately referenced the QRC and began to run the Engine Fire/Engine Severe Damage or Separation checklist. The EGT continued to climb and exceeded limits (712 Max) with no signs of recovery with the throttle moved to idle. We subsequently continued the QRC and secured the right engine. We then completed all steps of the checklist upon continuing with the flight manual and coordinated for an expeditious return to departure airport. We cleaned up the aircraft to flaps 5 and 210 KIAS; began cross feeding fuel; climbed to 3;000 feet; calculated landing distance and completed vectors to a single engine landing utilizing the ILS. Weather was not a factor and winds were approximately 10-12 knots. I was able to coordinate with the FAs per the FOM and then conveyed the situation to the passengers. We stopped straight ahead on the runway and coordinated for Fire/Rescue forces to inspect the aircraft for any signs of further fire or damage that would limit our ability to clear the runway. We were given the all clear and subsequently taxied to parking. Shut down was normal. Upon a thorough debrief; we believe we accomplished all required checklist and emergency action items; as well as used excellent CRM to back each other up and set up the aircraft for the immediate return and recovery.,B767 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after inflight shutdown of the right engine following a compressor stall and EGT overtemp event.

Noted that both packs were tripped/amber.  [Requested priority handling] and initiated an descent.  The PAX O2 mask deployed at 14;000 cabin altitude.  We were at about 16;000 MSL at that time.  About 3-5 minutes after mask deployment the FA's reported smoke; electrical smell and heat in the cabin.  Diverted to ZZZ.  Had AARF check aircraft that was stopped on the runway for indications of fire.  None noted.  Taxied to the gate X.  Deplaned the PAX and filled out the AML.I suspect an open MEL (#1 eng HP bleed) played a role. I think the reported smoke; smell and heat were a combination of the PAX O2 generators plus an unpressurized vessel flying in warm ambient conditions.  Plus the O2 generators read 200 degrees Fahrenheit at gate with the AARF equipment. If this turns out to be the case training on this would be helpful.,A319 flight crew reported a fumes event during cruise resulting in a diversion.

The First Officer and I scanned the flight deck for unreliable airspeed; fire warnings and any possible pressurization problems. We were in agreement that none were present and could not locate the source of the warnings; I elected to disengage the autopilot and auto throttles; to verify control of the aircraft. The First Officer and I searched again for any indication of fire or airspeed issues. We found none. With the fire bell still sounding we elected to return to ZZZ and request priority.   ATC was notified and vectors given back to Runway XX. Having just departed and well over the gross landing weight; we planned the longest runway available.  I notified the A Flight Attendant; to prepare the cabin for landing and that we had about 10 minutes to touchdown.The First Officer computed the landing data and a visual approach was planned. Landing weight was XXX;000 pounds; and the Ref Speed 1XX. ATC provided vectors to a base leg and we were cleared for the visual approach. The landing and rollout were normal and I elected to let the aircraft roll to the end and turnoff; stop the aircraft and allow CFR to inspect for fire. As soon as I stopped the aircraft; I made a PA to the Flight Attendants and Passengers to remain seated. Ground was contacted and we spoke directly with fire command. No evidence of fire was found to exist. The First Officer computed the brake cooling module for and potential issues that would prevent us from parking at the gate or cooling required. None were found. Coordination with ZZZ Operations as to our situation and a gate was completed and we taxied to gate X. At the gate we were met by the Fire Crew; ZZZ Maintenance and Ground Operations.  The warnings continued to sound and were not able to be silenced by Maintenance Personnel. I made two logbook entries for the discrepancies and the overweight landing and gave a debrief of the event to the Maintenance Personnel. Dispatch was contacted and informed of the situation and we agreed to talk later as my main focus was still dealing with passengers and Ground Ops. After passenger deplaning; the aircraft was handed over to maintenance and the First Officer and I went to the Crew lounge; where we contacted Dispatch and conducted a debrief of the events with the Chief Pilot.,B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported an air turn back caused by a malfunctioning central warning computer.

On takeoff; we noticed an oily odor. I thought this was something transient and continued takeoff. At about 4;000 feet the smell was not going away. I said we need to return to ZZZ. We [requested ATC priority handling for an air return] and put our O2 masks on. I called the Flight Attendants (FA's) and asked if they smelled anything. They said yes. We made an approach and overweight landing to Runway XXL. Prior to landing; I called on another radio for a gate. By this time at least one FA was on portable O2. I asked the Tower to send paramedics to Gate. I began the fumes checklist on the QRC. Once those initial actions were complete I stopped because we were getting close to a landing. Two AML entries were made. One for the fumes event and another for an overweight landing. According to the AML; the aircraft hit a bird the day before and an engine was bore scoped. When we arrived at the gate; Maintenance was powering hydraulic systems and testing reversers. When we got to the gate; I told the passengers to exit out the forward door quickly. After a couple of minutes of securing the flight deck; I opened the door and no one had gotten off. There was a fireman testing the air just inside the aircraft door.,Air Carrier flight crew reported an air return during initial climb due to a fume event.

Maintenance interrogated the system and MEL'd the message iaw MEL XX-XX. Enroute the Purser called and stated 'we have an issue; in reviewing our manual we have a Class A fume event in the forward galley. It smells like dirty gym socks.' I've had fume events in the past and I know the ramifications to the safety of the crew and passengers. We also have received good training during [Flight Attendant Training]. In the cockpit we didn't smell anything. All three flight attendants confirmed the same smell. With a Jump seat rider in the cockpit; I made the decision to take a quick bathroom break. Upon reaching the front right galley is was prevalent; mild and persistent. Upon returning to the cockpit I had the purser remain in the cockpit. I used air cell to call Dispatch and maintenance. With pilots; purser; dispatch and maintenance all on the phone call we jointly made the decision it's best to divert to a suitable airport. Over the vicinity of ZZZ2 and ZZZ3 we evaluated diversions to outstations; continue to ZZZ4 or ZZZ5. We were 570 miles from ZZZ4 and 240 from ZZZ5. Knowing ZZZ5 was just as close as spiraling down from FL380 and the aircraft would be grounded; we took into consideration passengers re-accomodation; medical response; inflight support and aircraft replacement. ZZZ5 was the best option and the joint decision was made to proceed to ZZZ5. I asked the First Officer (F/O) to [request priority] from ATC and we proceeded direct to a fix on ILS [Runway] XXR and landed and taxied to the Gate. With the jump seater being pregnant and the review of other events where fumes become hard to smell after long exposure; I requested everyone in cockpit to wear oxygen. I ran through QRC and [other procedures] multiple times to make sure we didn't miss any steps. Managing and reassessing the issue I think we did a pretty thorough job. I even turned on APU and ran bleeds to trouble shoot and nothing was working. The smell persisted in a mild to moderate amount especially in descent according to Flight Attendants (F/As). The purser had F/As rotate to mitigate one persons exposure. With a full aircraft we couldn't move anyone. Upon landing and shutting down we de-masked and opened up flight door. The first officer immediately noticed the smell and we left shortly after securing the aircraft.  I was not aware that the F/As had on the previous leg noticed any smell. They all reported after the event that the dirty socks smell was present on the previous flight. When I took over the aircraft I was again blind sided by this. The F/A in aft galley even said she replaced her socks thinking it was her feet. So my suggestion is to continue to encourage communications from the cabin and have these experiences validated and documented even if there is the slightest question to certain smells. I don't know if the Air Bleed message would have an impact on this event but if so maybe adding instructions to confirm with crew no odors prior to MEL. Having these Name (Purser) able to locate his references on his tablet was huge in assisting me with my QRH.,A319 flight crew reported a fume event occurred during cruise; resulting in a diversion.

Overweight landing at 193.4 lbs. Landed and stopped on the runway. Taxied to [the gate].The engine was written up with the same problem and priority 2 days earlier. Maintenance performed a engine run up and bore check but did not have the airplane flown. Flying the airplane would had been a more prudent and accurate test that would had most likely given the same result as we experienced. The change in the AOA during rotation is when the engine exceeded EGT temperature limitation.Put the aircraft in a more realistic and accurate situation that would produce actual information for maintenance to make a greater determination of airworthiness.,Pilot reported an air turn back after engine exhaust gas temperature exceeded limits.

Got a call from approach at 8;100 feet letting us know we were low and to climb up to 8;600 feet I immediately disconnected the auto pilot and initiated a climb while maintaining LOC. After crossing ZZZZZ I then recommenced my descent and flew visually using the PAPI as my guidance. Landed the aircraft within the touch down range and stopped on the runway. CA taxied aircraft to gate. During taxi we were informed by approach that the GS had issues and they thought it had been fixed. We initially intercepted the GS and LOC approximately 20 miles out. At approximately 2 miles out the GS was back in line with the PAPI.,Flight crew reported descending below minimum altitude on approach and climbed back to correct altitude. ATC advised flight crew that there had previously been problems with the glide slope.

I was the PF(Pilot Flying) so I took the radios while the Captain ran the Engine Low Oil Pressure checklist which then directed him to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist. The oil pressure dropped rapidly to approximately 3 PSI and the oil quantity dropped to 0. The checklist directed us to shutdown the #2 engine. We [requested priority handling] and coordinated with ATC for vectors to air return via the ILS XXL to ZZZ. We completed all appropriate checklists and coordinated with Dispatch; the flight attendants; and gave a reassuring PA to the passengers. The approach and landing were uneventful. After exiting the runway we were met by emergency vehicles and inspected. No damage or abnormalities were noted so we returned to gate X. We elected to shutdown and get towed to the gate. Two maintenance ELB (Electronic Log Book) entries were made and the Captain coordinated with Dispatch and the Chief Pilot via phone.,B737 Pilot reported oil pressure problems with the number 2 engine; requested priority handling and returned to departure airport.

Oil pressure and quantity was dropping rapidly. Ran the 'Engine Low Oil Pressure' checklist followed by 'Engine Failure or Shutdown' checklist. No overweight landing. [Requested priority handling]. Normal approach and landing. Equipment met the aircraft after taxiing clear of runway. After getting the all clear from them we taxied to the gate and got tugged in. Called maintenance and dispatch. Spoke with Chief Pilot and maintenance. Made two maintenance entries. All went great.,B737 Captain reported an oil pressure problem resulting in a return to departure airport.

When the FO stowed the Speed Brakes the aircraft abruptly rolled 35 degrees to the left. The autopilot had difficulty controlling the aircraft so we disconnected and FO flew manually. The FO quickly and accurately corrected the left-roll tendency with right ailerons; leveled the wings and continued the arrival. Simultaneously to these events the SPOILERS EICAS illuminated. We slowed to 250 KIAS to minimize the left-roll tendency and informed ATC. We decided to have the FO continue to fly and handle radios while I ran the non-normal checklist; coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance and ran the TEST with the Lead Flight Attendant. After finishing the SPOILERS EICAS checklist and the other coordination was complete it was determined that some of the spoilers on the left wing remained in the UP position and would not stow. I opted to request priority handling and requested the ILS to Runway XXC with a long; 20 mile final; which ATC coordinated. We then gradually slowed and configured the aircraft; determining the aircraft controllability with each configuration change. Once final landing configuration (Flaps 30) and target speed were established the aircraft continued the left-roll tendency but was manageable. The FO accurately noted that at target speed the speed tape showed little margin above stick shaker activation; so we opted to add 10 Knots to our target speed. I believe this was due to the spoilers still extended on the left wing. The remainder of the approach and landing being uneventful as the FO made an excellent landing. I took the aircraft on the rollout and we met the responding Emergency personnel. They checked us over and we taxied to the gate.,Flight Crew reported a spoiler issue caused aircraft controllability issues which resulted in a precautionary landing.

We had just turned off our center fuel pumps a few minutes prior. We performed the IMBAL checklist which then led us to the Fuel Leak Engine checklist. By this point it was decided that the safest course of action was to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and were cleared direct to ZZZ and were given a descent clearance. We shut down the #2 engine per the Fuel Leak Engine checklist. We also performed the One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist; the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist; and the Overweight Landing checklist. I was the Pilot Flying until downwind; at which time the Captain took the controls and landed the aircraft. We stopped on the runway and had the firefighters check out the aircraft. Everything looked ok to them and we were cleared to taxi to the gate. The Captain made an AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) entry for the suspected fuel leak and overweight landing.The only causal factor was the mechanical irregularity of the right fuel tank showing 1;000 lbs less than the left; which gave us the IMBAL message.,B737-800 First Officer reported a fuel imbalance message in flight; causing an in-flight shut down of the #2 engine and a return to the departure airport.

FA said it sounded like someone pounding on the fuselage with a sledgehammer repeatedly. We leveled off at FL280 immediately and reduced speed from 280 KIAS to 250 KIAS. I asked the FO to look for a nearby field with good weather.  FA recorded the noise via video on her cell phone and brought it to the cockpit. After reviewing the video; we decided to divert to ZZZ. We notified dispatch and coordinated with the FA's and informed the passengers. During the descent and configuration of the aircraft for landing at ZZZ; with the flaps at 5deg; I called for Flaps 10 while the aircraft speed was at 209 KIAS. I immediately said 'delay that stay at flaps five.' I believe the FO moved the flap handle out of the 5 detent and returned it immediately. The flaps remained at 5 degrees and I continued to slow the aircraft. I called for gear down an Flaps 15; flaps 25; flaps 30 landing checklist. I noticed the stick shaker indicator on the airspeed tape was in an unusual position and cross checked the configuration to find the flaps were at 5. We were at approximately 1200 feet when I announced 'going around'; but did not hit TOGA as I did not want GA thrust. At this point; the FO and I were convinced that the two problems were related; that there was some structural damage to the flaps.We climbed to 5;000 feet and referenced the Checklist for FLAPS - TRAILING EDGE FLAPS DISAGREE. We returned the flap lever to 5; then selected 2. The flaps retracted to 2. The checklist directed us to 'Proceed normally.' We had a discussion about what that meant and were not comfortable with extending the flaps again; with suspected mechanical damage to the flaps already existing. We got a phone patch with Maintenance Control and dispatch on HF and discussed the two issues and our checklist. They had no additional advice. We discussed the plan to land in the current flap configuration (flap 2); using the flap up speeds with Maintenance Control and dispatch. The FO had already assessed the landing distance and we referenced the FLAPS- TRAILING EDGE FLAPS UP LANDING checklist. We landed on RWY XXL at ZZZ; at VREF 40 + 40 + 5. I used auto brakes 3; and rolled to the end of the runway. We had the fire/rescue look us over for damage prior to proceeding to the gate. They reported a large cable hanging from the satellite antenna. The PSEU (Proximity Switch Electronics Unit) light came on after landing. The FO and I debriefed the events in detail post flight and during the next two flights. It was not until the following morning; that I realized that in all likelihood; I caused the flap malfunction by calling for flaps 10 at 209 KIAS. The SATCOM antenna seal failure noise was significantly concerning; and I assumed the flap issue was directly related.,First Officer reported a SATCOM antenna became dislodged on take off; repeatedly striking against the fuselage. Flight crew elected to divert for a precautionary landing.

Master Caution; Fuel; and Filter Bypass light on #1 Engine illuminated. Flying duties were transferred to First Officer and QRH procedure was accomplished.  Only the #1 Engine Filter Bypass was illuminated and the engine was operating normally. Decision was made to continue to ZZZ and request priority handing as a precaution and to avoid any unnecessary delays. ATC controllers were very helpful with one exception. When we checked in with Approach Control  (I believe the frequency was X) the controller immediately issued us a 40 knot reduction in airspeed to sequence another aircraft in front of us. This would have created an unstable approach and was the exact situation we were trying to avoid by asking for priority handling. We reminded him that we were a priority aircraft and were beginning to slow as we configured. Normal landing was uneventful with Tower and Ground controllers again very helpful.  Dispatch; FODO [Flight Officer Duty Officer] and line maintenance in ZZZ were contacted and briefed. Flight Attendants were debriefed.Brief Approach controller on importance of assisting Emergency Aircraft.,Captain reported an engine fuel filter bypass light illuminated. Captain elected to request priority handling to land at destination airport.

When we looked down; the Captain noticed that IFF 2 had a fault and switched it to his side. At about that time we both noticed a power surge which made my clock blank momentarily and the Captain noticed lights on his panel flash. Next we had a series of lights come on spaced apart by a few minutes at first and then began to come on more quickly as time passed. First we had a cooling fan supply light. Then when cleared to descend via the arrival; I pushed recall and noticed the left pack light remained illuminated. Suspecting something wrong with the power distribution system; I cycled through electrical panel wafer switch positions and found no amps coming from TR 2 or 3 and negative 3 amps on the battery. I hacked my clock. About 5 minutes had already passed. I took the radios while the Captain ran the checklist for the pack light next and shortly after; we lost the left aft fuel boost pump. I told the Captain I thought we had a power distribution problem and we were draining our battery. I thought we might be slowly shedding components due to their power sources being associated with the battery. As we passed 10;000 ft. I told the Captain and he put away the book and ran the landing checklist. While on the descent; I recommended [requesting priority handling] so we could land ASAP. I configured early in prep for a slam dunk and the Captain and I agreed to starting the APU just in case. By this time we were on base and more lights had come on. We lost the B Electrical Hydraulic Pump; had a right side window over heat light; battery discharge light; TR fail light; and a few pitot lights had come on. Then while turning to final; I noticed the short vectors would overshoot me so I clicked off autopilot and turned. That's when I noticed I had no electric trim. The Captain manually ran the trim for me as we slowed and configured and we had an uneventful landing. After the fire trucks greeted us and found no hot spots around the E & E bay; we discussed whether we had enough power on the battery and I noted the time had been 17 minutes from when I noticed the negative amps on the battery and started the clock. We continued to taxi to the gate and after the fire crew came up I went with them down to the E & E bays to do my own inspection. I didn't see or smell anything. Aircraft X is an old airplane. The older planes get the more they will have gremlins like this. Maintenance discovered a faulty number 2 generator or regulator with some certainty that an Aircraft phase was not getting to the busses. How many more lights would have come on eventually? Just thank goodness we were so close to landing when it failed.,First Officer reported that system annunciator lights began to illuminate so Flight Crew requested priority handling and made a landing at the destination airport. Maintenance determined an integrated drive generator had failed and on phase was not working.

All engine indications appeared normal including engine fuel flow.  Checking our fuel we determined we were showing an imbalance of approximately 1500 pounds with the right wing being low. We continued to monitor to determine if the fuel imbalance remained stable or if the imbalance was increasing. We received a second call from the flight attendant informing us we had a company A320 instructor pass riding. He and I spoke and he told me it appeared to be fuel trailing the #2 engine. I sent the First Officer back to the cabin for a visual inspection and told him to look forward and aft of the wing and specifically any damage he might see on the forward edge of the wing.  While he performed a visual inspection; the flight attendant in the cockpit showed me cell phone video of the leak. I leveled off at FL380 and verified the fuel imbalance was increasing to about 1700lbs with the right wing on the low side.  I referenced the QRH for fuel leak and sent dispatch a message that we had a fuel leak; needed to divert and would be shutting down the #2 engine. The First Officer returned and informed me of the same information and we began running the fuel leak QRH.  Dispatch recommended ZZZZ and looking at our distance and time required for descent I determined it to be a proper divert location. I [requested priority] with ZZZZ Center and requested an immediate turn to ZZZZ and descent to FL 200. The First Officer and I ran the fuel leak QRH which directed an engine shutdown for a fuel leak out of the engine or pylon followed by the engine shutdown checklist.  We shut the engine down in an idle power descent and I started the APU. I then transferred flying duties to the First Officer.  ZZZZ Center handed us off to ZZZZ Approach. ZZZZ is an non radar airfield. They told us to report 30 miles from the airfield and asked if we could maintain VMC.   Weather was scattered to broken with some vertical development but was sufficient to maintain VMC and the field was reporting 6;000 scattered.  Approach gave us a descent to 7;000 and offered the [non-precision] Approach to Runway XX. I asked for the ILS for XX. Approach asked if we could fly a visual to Runway 26 and conditions were sufficient for that and we were cleared for the visual approach. We never received guidance information on our ILS though it was programmed correctly. After an uneventful landing by the First Officer we taxied to a hard stand. Foreign Country aviation authorities inspected our certificates/medical/airworthiness certificate/insurance certificate which the company instructor was very helpful working that while I worked with operations. Operations moved the passengers indoors to a gate seating area. I worked with the Chief Pilot and Maintenance Control. They informed me that the passengers would be taken on a flight from ZZZZ-ZZZZ1-ZZZ. I made several announcements and trips to the gate holding area and informed all passengers of our plan.  Most of the passengers had left carry-on bags on the aircraft; but Foreign Country security wouldn't let them return to retrieve it. I coordinated with Station Operations to have aft air stairs brought up so we could get the passenger to come back and file front to back through the airplane to retrieve their items before their inbound flight arrived and coordinated with Foreign Country security.  Foreign Country security eventually agreed but only allowing 4 passengers at a time.,A320 flight crew reported a fuel leak from the #2 engine resulted in a fuel imbalance. The flight crew performed a successful diversion and landing.

While investigating what it was there was a second bang and this time I saw glass shards coming off window 3L and saw the windows inner pane had completely shattered.  We leveled off at 16;000 ft. assessed the situation and decided to turn to ZZZ. Dispatch was notified and with no pressurization; controllability; or overweight landing issues no emergency was declared. Approach and landing were uneventful.,Captain reported cockpit window 3L shattered during climb and elected to perform an air turn back to a safe precautionary landing.

Flight Attendants were fully briefed on the situation. QRH pertaining to ENG FAIL complied with. First Officer (FO) maintained control of aircraft while Captain completed all checklists; briefings; and ATC coordination. At approximately 6;500 ft. MSL; all checklists were complete and appropriate data entered. Captain took control of the aircraft; as PF; to perform the single-engine approach and landing. Aircraft landed normally.  CFR circled aircraft to ensure all was well. Passengers briefed. Brake cooling module was performed. We waited the required XX minutes for cooling. Aircraft parked at the gate with normal Passenger deplanement. Captain met with ZZZ Maintenance. Captain performed a full Flight Attendant de-briefing.  Captain then called the ZZZ1 Chief Pilot on call; Maintenance; Supervisor; and Dispatch. Captain further met with the ZZZ Chief Pilot to complete debriefing. No further incident ensued.,Air carrier Captain reported an EGT fail on the #1 engine and other erratic engine indications during approach.

After looking at QRH I decided to make the FO (First Officer) the flying pilot and take control of checklist which leads to an engine shutdown. We [requested priority handling] and descended to 260 in a drift down. ZZZZ looked to be the closest suitable airport and messaged dispatch with our condition and intentions and they agreed. Set course for ZZZZ and briefed the FA (Flight Attendant) with [acronym]. Discussed situation with passengers and then continued with preparing for arrival. I.E. Nonnormal landing config; one engine inop approach and landing; briefed the approach and discussed the threats. FO did a great job and parked at a hard stand. Very impressive how the Dispatch runs this place.,B737 Captain reported engine hydraulic and oil warning lights resulted in engine shutdown.

I told her to see if she could determine the source of the smoke and if there was a fire for her to put it out. I was the pilot monitoring and I [requested priority handling] and asked ATC for an airport to divert to for an immediate landing.  ATC recommended ZZZ and cleared us direct. I asked ATC to advise our dispatch of our intentions. I completed the QRC checklist and advised the First Officer to continue flying. I then proceeded with the QRH. I checked with the flight attendants and they told me that the smoke had stopped and there was no sign of fire. The first asked me if she should plan on an precautionary landing and I told her yes. I briefed the first flight attendant and then advised the passengers of the same. As we descended I 'all-called' the flight attendants and again asked them if there was any sign of smoke in the cabin. They said 'no sign of smoke and that the smell had dissipated.'  At this point I was confident that we had eliminated the smoke source. I checked ZZZ in the manual which listed it as an alternate airport. While looking at the manual I saw that ZZZ1 is listed as a Regular airport. Per step 4 of the QRH SMOKE procedure I discussed the option of landing at ZZZ1 with the First Officer and we decided it was a better choice now that we had determined the smoke had been positively eliminated. I checked with the flight attendants again and was advised by them that the cabin was still clear of any smoke or odor.  We changed our destination with ATC and I believe I sent an ACARS to dispatch advising them of the same. If not; I typed it but failed to send it. We were still very busy at that time and I do recall receiving an acknowledgement from him. I then called the flight attendants one more time and advised them that I was de-escalating the situation to a precautionary landing and we had changed our destination to ZZZ1. We landed and taxied to the gate at ZZZ1 without further incident. After arriving at the gate I advised the passengers to stay seated while the fire personnel came on board the aircraft. Fire personnel boarded the aircraft and I explained the situation to them. I asked them if they would check row XX as a safety precaution. The cabin was unlit due to the Commercial P.B. [push button] being pushed. I had turned off the Commercial P.B. while executing the QRC check list. Later that evening while reviewing the procedure I realized that the QRC directs only for the GALLEY & CAB P.B. to be turned off. Turning off the Commercial P.B was an error on my part while executing the QRC checklist. The cabin was dimly lit and I wanted to restore the cabin lights but I did not want to start the problem all over again. I asked the first if she had switched off all electrical power to the seats and entertainment system and she said yes. I believe I asked her twice and she said yes each time. I turned the Commercial P.B. back on and very quickly thereafter a flight attendant came from the back to the front and said smoke was again coming from row XX. I immediately turned the Commercial P.B. back off and told the first flight attendant to initiate emergency deplaning procedures. The passengers all exited the aircraft calmly and without incident. Fire personnel then checked row XX with thermal imaging and told me that there was no unexpected heat source. The passengers then returned for their belongings and I contacted my dispatcher and briefed him on the situation.  I have attempted to be as accurate and thorough in this report as possible; however; I know there are things that I have not remembered or remembered in the wrong order.I take full responsibility for turning the Commercial P.B. off while executing the QRC. I believe the error occurred due to task saturation and an urgency on my part to rectify the situation. I also take full responsibility for turning the Commercial P.B. back on at the gate. I sincerely thought that it was a safe and good course of action to turn the lights back on. It was my decision and in retrospect I was wrong. If I am presented with a similar situation in the future it will not happen again. I do not have any suggestions to prevent this particular situation from occurring in the future. As for myself I will endeavor to be more precise and deliberate while executing an Emergency Checklist.,Captain reported diverting after Flight Attendant reported smoke and fumes in the cabin. The smoke and fumes were apparently associated with the Cabin Commercial Push Button on the CIDS (Cabin Intercommunication Display System) Panel.

I transferred control to the First Officer and completed the ECAM actions.  After referencing the QRH; there were many items now unavailable for use on landing.   Among these were gravity gear extension and no nose steering upon landing.  I contacted dispatch and maintenance to let them know our situation; and they advised us that ZZZ and tech ops would be ready for us upon landing.   I reiterated to dispatch that we would need a tow in from the runway upon landing and was assured they would be ready.  We briefly thought about diverting; but with a full load we were overweight.   We elected to continue to ZZZ.We discussed at length on the flight southbound what we needed to do upon arrival.   I chose not to inform inflight or the customers of the failure until closer to ZZZ.  I called the #1 up to the cockpit about an hour out and explained to her we had a code yellow.  I went into detail the nature of the problem and how it might affect our landing.   I explained that I didn't think there would be anything abnormal on landing other than the fire trucks and being towed to the gate.  Everyone was professional and did their jobs as trained.  I made a PA to the customers about 40 minutes out and explained the failure in layman's terms and what they could expect on landing.Out of an abundance of caution with a hydraulic failure; I instructed the First Officer to request priority handling with ZZZ approach.  After all pertinent information was exchanged we requested a 20 mile final to be sure we could get all checklist items completed before landing.  On downwind we slowed and lowered the gear successfully by the gravity extension.   We then configured the aircraft for landing.  ATC asked if we were ready for the approach and we flew a 15 mile final to runway 10L.  We reiterated to the tower that we would not be able to clear the runway upon landing.  We touched down about 1500 feet down the runway and braked to a stop abeam Taxiway XX.  I made a quick PA when the aircraft stopped to ask everyone to stay seated.  We completed the after landing checklist; started the APU and shut down the engines.  The tug then entered the runway; hooked up to us and towed us to Gate XX.  The required logbook entries were made and I discussed our failure with CFR and tech ops.  Tech ops said there was a major leak on top of engine number one in a hydraulic line.,A320 Captain reported diverting after the loss of the green hydraulic system and made a precautionary landing.

I therefore asked the First Officer to reference the QRH; both of which had a QRH procedure.   There was no airborne procedure for the WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT.  We did apply the QRH procedure for BRAKES SYS 2 FAULT; but as soon as BRAKES SYS 2 FAULT cleared; we got a 'BRAKES SYS 1 FAULT' ECAM.I transferred aircraft control to the First Officer; and also delegated the radios to him.  I made voice contact with NAME via ACARS *call me request.  Dispatch got Maintenance Control and an Operations representative on the call.  I discussed the nature of the failure with all parties and after discussing continuing to ZZZ or diverting to either ZZZ1; ZZZ2; or ZZZ3; decide the safest choice considering runway length; weather; and emergency resources was a diversion to ZZZ3.Dispatch gave us fuel burn to and landing data at ZZZ3.  They also notified the station and arranged resources.I briefed the First Officer what transpired and decided to have him remain Pilot Flying.  I notified ATC of the diversion and advised ATC.The First Officer made a normal landing.  We landed uneventfully; came to a stop on center line; and the emergency vehicles approached the aircraft and have the all-clear for us to be towed off the runway to the gate.,A320 Captain reported Brake Sys 1 and 2; plus N/W steering fault ECAM messages in flight and elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

Landing at ZZZ2.Fuel system Fault caused by the Left Aft Aux tank failed to transfer to center tank.  Preformed ECAM procedure; called company Dispatch and Company Maintenance to help trouble shoot; but was unable to get fuel out of Aux tank. Myself; my First Officer; Dispatch and Maintenance all agreed best action was to land at ZZZ2; overweight if needed; to get repairs and for better care of passengers.Priority handling was requested with ATC; which is called for in our Company Manual (QRH). CFR was standing  at ZZZ2 on landing. Urgency was due to overweight landing and fuel system problem.,A321 Captain reported a fuel transfer problem caused a diversion and precautionary landing.

Continued takeoff and climbed to 4;000 feet MSL. Coordinated with Approach Control for holding north of ZZZ. Worked through Engine Oil Pressure Light QRH Checklist. Checklist led to shutdown of left engine. By the time we shutdown the left engine; we had zero oil quantity and some initial indications of engine vibration. Shut down engine. Coordinated with Approach. Notified Dispatch via ACARS and briefly spoke to them Dispatch. Initial landing runway at ZZZ was XXR; but that had a tailwind so we coordinated with Approach to land on XYL. Ran landing data for single engine flaps 15. Plenty of stopping margin with auto brake 3. Ran hot brakes; which showed us good to go to the gate. Got vectors to ILS XYL. Landed uneventfully. Crash and Rescue checked the brakes and aircraft and said we were good; so we went to the gate. At the gate Maintenance determined that the oil temperature sensor came out of the engine which resulted in losing all oil.,B737-700 flight crew reported loss of oil pressure on #2 engine during takeoff and performed and in flight shut down. Flight crew requested priority handing and mad an air turn back; making a precautionary landing.

Was attempting to verify what was happening through assessing what we actually had. After verifying high EGT and abnormal n2 rotation speed coordinated engine shutdown with First Officer who was the pilot flying. Requested priority handling due to single engine ops; but did not suspect severe damage in that we had no vibration; and no fire warning. Landed in approximately 20 minutes; uneventfully.We became very task saturated very quickly however; we were able to maintain positive control of the aircraft and of the situation.  ATC did an amazing job supporting our flight to ZZZ. There is not much anyone could have done to prevent this event.,A321 First Officer reported compressor stall on #2 engine. Flight Crew elected to make an in flight shut down of the affected engine and continue the approach to landing.

I called to the aft cabin and both FAs (Flight Attendants) could also smell an exhaust odor. I called the Captain and he confirmed he could also smell it. Captain agreed it was a fumes event. He said all his indicators were normal and we would be landing in 20 minutes. The #2 FA; was having trouble catching her breathe and her eyes were blood red. I immediately gave her O2 and informed Captain she was on oxygen. The Captain called back about 5 minutes to check on us. He said that paramedics would meet the flight; to check out all the crew. We landed safely in ZZZ without any further incidents.,A319 Flight Attendant reported notifying Captain of a fumes event during climb.

Five minutes later received call indicating #2 Flight Attendant was being administered oxygen. Due to crew member on oxygen [we] requested priority handling and Dispatch notified via ACARS. Paramedics met aircraft. Flight Attendant released. This flight was only 31 minutes. The ECAM LGCIU 2 had ECAM supplemental inoperative components that required crew discussion. The odor and subsequent flight attendant concern compressed our available time prior to landing. Our solid training had both myself and the First Officer working in unison to prioritize and complete all items.This flight was the first flight and engine run of the aircraft after an APU LP fuel valve maintenance write up. Perhaps a procedural change to include a maintenance test run of the engines after this type of write up to mitigate a repeat of this event.,A320 Captain reported a fumes event during cruise requiring one Flight Attendant to be put on oxygen.

Between XC09 and XC25 the left throttle was brought to Idle and a turn coordinated back to ZZZ with a descent to FL260 (S/E alt on VNAV page).  PIC SATCOM with MC/Dispatch. FO worked with ZZZZ Center. Direction was given by Maintenance to leave engine running until secondary indications. All steps of the low oil pressure procedure were completed except shutting down the left engine. Final RTB alt FL280 for military airspace. The engine remained at Idle until shutdown. No emergency declared at this time.Oil temp stayed steady ~100 and oil pressure fluctuated with the mean value decreasing. Wide abeam (21.3 miles) ZZZ1; the oil pressure was fluctuating around 74. [Requested priority handling] at that time. On base leg; outside ZZZZZ; for ILS XXR oil pressure went below min (70) triggering EICAS and the left engine was shutdown. ECL procedure was completed and Dispatch notified. Windmilling oil pressure was 9 on final. Alternate missed approach procedure was coordinated for single engine missed approach. Landing was uneventful. Landing was at XD36. Upon clearing runway; Tower asked if we were a PW; no response given.Post flight pilot inspection noted the oil cap was on. Oil was pooled under the engine and inside the bypass section appearing to originate from the front of the engine.,B777-200 Captain reported loss of left engine oil quantity in flight; requiring an inflight shut down of the affected engine and a return to the departure airport.

All ECAM actions were followed and First Officer was Pilot Flying. Priority handling was requested with ZZZ Center and we were given direct to ZZZ1. Dispatch was notified and FA communication was established. After being handed off to ZZZ1 approach we were vectored for an approach to RWY XX. ALL QRH follow-up procedures were completed and passenger PA accomplished. ZZZ1 approach assigned a discreet tower frequency that was monitored by ZZZ1 fire and rescue as well. Uneventful landing and roll out followed by inspection by ZZZ1 fire equipment in the east hold bay. After receiving the all clear we taxied to the open gate.The QRH has very good procedures for FA communications but a few salient bullet points should be added for the passenger PA announcements. All company and ATC people involved were at the highest professional level which reduced the overall stress of the situation.,A320 Captain reported compressor stalls required the in flight shut down of the #1 engine. Priority handling was requested and the aircraft diverted to make a precautionary landing.

We had fuel in the center tank and both center pumps were on. On climbout; the Captain noticed a slight fuel imbalance; with the right tank lower; and shortly after that the 'fuel imbalance' annunciator light turned on. We were climbing through about 16000 ft. when we started troubleshooting the issue. It appeared by the totalizer and right tank quantity indicators that we were either burning fuel from the right tank or had a fuel leak from the right wing or engine.As we climbed the imbalance worsened as the totalizer also indicated higher fuel loss than expected. The imbalance worsened to about 1500 lbs; and we attempted to balance the tanks by transferring fuel from left to right. The increase in fuel imbalance was abated using this method; and it also started to reduce the imbalance.We ran the QRH checklist for a potential fuel leak; deciding not to shut down the right engine to expedite the divert and due to our heavy weight; suspecting that would be less safe than keeping it running. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ via vectors to a visual approach Runway XX; with the ILS used as a backup.It was night and the weather was VFR. Upon an uneventful landing I utilized the left engine thrust reverser and we stopped on the runway and shutdown the right engine as a precaution. Emergency vehicles met the airplane to inspect the right wing and engine; nothing noteworthy was discovered. We taxied to the gate and shutdown the left engine; non-normal complete.CRM between myself and the Captain was excellent throughout the flight. The Captain read all non-normal checklist aloud and asked if I had any inputs or questions when appropriate. The demeanor in the cockpit was professional; calm; and business-like at all times as we worked our way through solving the problem and executing a divert back to ZZZ. The decision not to shut down the right engine was discussed at length and we both concluded that due to cockpit indications and our heavyweight the best course of action was to land immediately and shut it down on the runway. In retrospect this proved to be the correct call after maintenance personnel discovered multiple faults with the fuel totalizer and both wing compensators causing major fuel system instrument irregularities; and in fact no fuel leak was present.,B737 Captain reported an air turn back after a fuel imbalance was detected during climbout.

Crew rest was good; and I reported fit for duty about an hour before pick-up time from the hotel. We arrived at the plane slightly ahead of schedule. The Captain (CA) and I discussed a hydraulic leak on the aircraft that occurred the previous day. I was the first one on the plane and began the preflight. While testing the fire system I noticed the left engine fire loop did not illuminate. Further troubleshooting revealed the problem was with the 'B' loop. The CA reported the problem to maintenance. They confirmed the problem and deferred the issue. We left the system on the 'A' loop.  On the walk around I noticed that the left wheel well was abnormally dirty and still wet from the previous leak. I specifically looked closely at the fire bottles and couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. The levels were good.Taxi and takeoff were uneventful.On departure passing approximately 15;000 feet MSL the CA noticed the left engine overheat light flickered then went out. He tested the bulb and it tested good. I immediately went to the EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) gauges and noticed a 20-degree higher temperature on the left engine; but still well within limits. While I was looking at the EGT gauge the CA reported that the intermittent indications bounced back and forth between overheat and fault. When I looked down to study the light pattern the left engine fire light came on. We very briefly discussed that this seemed like an indication problem versus an actual fire/overheat; but we had to honor the lights in case there was something we could not see with other fire/overheat indications.The CA transferred aircraft control to me while he ran the checklist. I confirmed a level off with the CA and coordinated with ATC. We were initially assigned FL190; but we were already passing it; so I asked for FL200. I disengaged the autopilot and auto throttles anticipating correcting for single engine flight. The CA then confirmed the left engine immediate action items with me. I added right rudder and right rudder trim as the left engine spooled down. I coordinated with the CA and ATC for a left turn back to ZZZ along with a descent.Things got busy. I was manually flying; navigating; negotiating vectors and altitudes; and landing runway with ATC. The CA split his time then between running the checklist; paying attention to what I was doing; talking to the flight attendants; passengers; dispatch; and maintenance. I asked the CA if I should coordinate for holding and he said no. I began loading the approach for ZZZ ILS XXL; but did not execute until I could coordinate it with the CA. We went back and forth as to the best way to re-cruise the system. Eventually I just spun the cruise setting on the pressurization panel down to 7;000 ft.; and loaded 7;000 into the cruise page.Approaching abeam the field approximately 5;000 ft. the CA was ready to resume flying. He reloaded the approach; then asked me to extend the final approach fix ZZZZZ.We got an immediate descent and a 'tight' base vector abeam the final approach fix. There is a 'safety alert' when landing north on the Company Ops page that we were both aware of.The CA asked for the deferred items; but I did not have them up on my checklist. We were only about 8 miles out from the field at this point and in a great position to land; so the Captain decided it was better to continue at this point than go around. After realizing my checklist SA (Situational Awareness) was low and behind; I tried to keep the bigger picture safety of flight items in my cross check: aircraft configuration; energy state; threats from VFR aircraft at ZZZ1; and our approach into ZZZ.ZZZ approach kept us tight and close to ZZZ to avoid ZZZ1 traffic. We were given a 'dog-leg' to final that was going to have us intercept final inside the FAF. The final approach fix ZZZZZ is 8NM from the runway. We were told not to descend out of 2;600 ft.; until past the extended centerline forRunway XX/XY and cleared for the visual approach to Runway XXL. It was a beautiful VFR day; and we were visual with ZZZ and ZZZ1 15-20 miles out. I was occupied with searching for conflicting traffic at ZZZ1. The CA asked me to arm the approach; but it would not activate. We were also now busy configuring the gear and flaps to 15 and slowing to target speed. Rather than keep messing with the approach mode I announced we were past the conflict at ZZZ1 and visual to the correct runway and cleared to descend. We switched to tower and were cleared to land on Runway XXL.We used the normal landing checklist but modified it for our single engine approach.Final approach and landing were uneventful. We elected to exit off the runway and onto a taxiway to stop.The Tower gave us a ground frequency that the Fire Chief would also be on. We spoke to the fire department; and they checked out the aircraft and ran a thermal temperature sensor over the engines and the brakes. While they were doing that I talked to Company Ops about a gate. The fire chief declared the aircraft to be safe; so I coordinated to taxi back to the new gate.Upon engine shutdown at the gate; I noticed the left engine start level was not in cutoff.In retrospect; I should have advocated (or requested) to go into holding. It was not obvious at the time; but I had lost SA on what actions the CA had accomplished and where we were at in the checklist. It only became clear when on base he asked me for the 'deferred items' and I did not have them called up. The extra time would have allowed for a more thorough mind-meld. It would have also given us the opportunity to catch any checklist mistakes. I felt like we had a solid; simple plan to come back VFR to the long runway with a single engine approach. We got the aircraft and passengers back in a safe and efficient manner; but it felt rushed. It was only afterward that I recognized that the rushed feeling was self-imposed.,B737 flight crew reported engine overheat indications during departure climb. The crew returned to the departure airport and landed without incident.

Normal takeoff and climb to FL340. At XA40Z the #2 engine driven hydraulic pump low pressure light illuminated. Hydraulic pressure system B slowly dropped to a very low indication with the system B pressure showing 2;980 PSI. The QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) was ran. Dispatch was contacted via frequency and a patch with Maintenance Control was initiated. B system quantity was showing 106 with pressure holding around 3;000 PSI. It was decided that the indicator failed and we (Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and Flight Crew) decided that it was fine to continue to ZZZ1. The FO (First Officer) and I decided to closely monitor the hydraulic systems as we continued. Approximately 6 to 8 minutes later; we saw the B system pressure drop to 100 psi with a zero quantity indicated. We ran the Hydraulic System B failure checklist in the QRH; contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. We decided to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ with an uneventful landing on RWY XXL per the QRH.,B737 flight crew reported hydraulic failure in cruise resulting in a return to departure airport.

We donned our oxygen mask; initiated a priority descent and advised with ZZZ Center. We leveled off at 10;000 feet. I called the Purser to assess the situation in the cabin. The passenger oxygen masks did not deploy. We made the decision to divert to ZZZ and I completed the brief with the Purser and made PAs to the passengers. We landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate.,A319 flight crew reported a pressurization malfunction during cruise. The flight diverted and landed uneventfully.

We heard a 'flapping' sound and immediately had the EWD (Engine Warning Display) display the Pressure page and it was showing the cabin climbing at 4100 fpm+. That cleared itself and we both agreed to stop our climb at FL220. Selected the Pressure page and it showed the cabin still climbing at 500-600 fpm and the cabin altitude at around 4;500 feet. We watched it continue to climb and decided that there was a malfunction in the system but had no ECAM warning associated with it at that time. We decided the best course of action was to descend immediately and return to ZZZ. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and he took control of the plane and the radios while I called the company (ZZZ Ops & Maintenance Control as well as the Dispatcher). I then notified the #1 F/A that we were returning to ZZZ and we had had a pressurization malfunction but to expect a normal flight back to the airport. The First Officer received a clearance to descend and a turn back to ZZZ. We prepared for a normal approach to [Runway] XXR and landed without further incident. Our landing weight was approximately 127;000 lbs well under our max landing weight. Cause - Simple mechanical malfunction. But a contributing factor might be that the aircraft had the left Pack on MEL.Suggestions - Again; this was just a mechanical failure that we had to deal with...you know FIX!,A319 flight crew reported a pressurization system malfunction in climb. Returned to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

It was a bit turbulent on the way out so we waited until it smoothed out to do service.  During service around rows 7-13 I noticed a very heavy; thick foul locker room type smell. I had a burning in my chest; in my eyes and nose. I told [F/A name] and asked if he noticed anything?  He said he did smell something bad; but he wasn't feeling any symptoms. I got a headache; dizziness; light headedness and became short of breath. I notified the Captain as I was the Lead Flight Attendant last night. I asked the 2 other flight attendants if they noticed the smell. [F/A name] walked through the rows I told her and said she smelled it a little bit but said she didn't feel any symptoms. [name] didn't notice anything as she was in the back of the aircraft. I do not know if any passengers were affected as my own medical care became urgent.After about 15 minutes my chest tightened and I became so short of breath I headed to the back of the aircraft because I was worried I was going to faint. My head was pounding in the base of my skull and in the back of my neck. I had taken an [medication] just in case it was heart burn; but it did not help with the burning in my chest and my nose. In the back of the aircraft I became very weak and my arms and hands started to cramp up in weird formations and I couldn't feel my arms or control my fingers. One of the flight attendants put me on oxygen. My hands got stuck like I was having a seizure; and I could not move my fingers. It was also hard to move my arms. I lost feeling in my legs from the waist down and in my feet. I had to lay on the floor because I was afraid I was going to fall and couldn't walk because I couldn't feel my feet. The other flight attendants asked for medical assistance on board. My apple watch was showing a high heart rate and the medical people on the aircraft started to remove my clothing so they could put the AED on me; but they were having difficulty because I could not move. We were still flying with approximately 18 minutes left of flight based on the timer on my watch. I had to move from the FA4 jump seat to the floor. When I was flat on the floor and could not move my own body. I was very weak. They landed the plane with me on the floor and I think 2-3 people around me holding me trying to work on me so I was safe. They kept saying I was tachycardic. When we landed the paramedics came on board the aircraft and kicked the 3 people out. They cut my clothes off; started an IV; put me on new oxygen; and finally put the pads on my chest. The paramedics said I was tachycardic and in SVT [Supraventricular Tachycardia]. They had to lift me into a wheelchair to remove me from the aircraft. I was then put on a stretcher and taken to the hospital by ambulance. Inside the ambulance they hooked me up to the AED to monitor my heart. They gave me another IV and I think they gave me some kind of medicine. I don't remember what it was because I was fading in and out. My body became very limp and I just wanted to sleep. My arms kept having pains and the spasms of my arms tightening and my fingers getting stuck kept happening on and off for quite a while. And I couldn't feel my legs or my feet. My face was becoming numb and I couldn't feel my nose or my lips. The paramedics kept saying I was in SVT and not out of the woods yet. They said my condition was not consistent with life. This scared me. At the hospital so many people were there so quickly to work on me. I tried to give them my health history; current medications; and showed them the heart monitor on my chest that my cardiologist had prescribed in case that would help them. I also tried to show them my phone that was connected to my apple watch in case that information could also help them since I have the apple watch 6 which monitors my heart rate; oxygen level; and can do an ECG. I bought that watch last year to help monitor my body while I was flying because of the other 2 fume events that happened in year that landed me in the hospital back then. It was all so very scary and embarrassing. After some testing; blood work; and continued heart monitoring I was released after a few hours and sent to a hotel where I am at now. I will fly back to ZZZ later this afternoon.The doctor said I had Supraventricular Tachycardia; elevated levels of carbon monoxide; and that I had acute hyperventilation syndrome.,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported a fumes event during initial descent. Flight Attendant experienced multiple physiological symptoms which progressively intensified; resulting in incapacitation. Upon gate arrival paramedics provided treatment and transported Flight Attendant to a local hospital.

On climb out the forward center pump pressure light came on at 400 pounds. A few minutes later we notice over 1;000 pound imbalance and started a cross feed.  Reaching level off the throttles began to split about 2 inches and it's command sector was active with no throttle movement.  The #2 engine then slowly began to wind down in increments and finally completely.  A restart was attempted with no results. During this we diverted to ZZZ.,B737 flight crew reported a #2 Engine spool down and subsequent failure at cruise. A fuel imbalance followed and the flight crew elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

We ran the appropriate QRH for Autopilot Disengage; Autothrottle Disengage; Altitude Alert. I requested priority handling with ATC and requested radar vectors to the final for the RNAV approach where we landed without incident. The fire department was dispatched for our landing.Cause - Complete failure of the MCP. Followed ATC instructions to the airport.,B737 flight crew reported complete failure of MCP; flight directors; auto-throttles and auto-pilots requiring ATC vectors for RNAV approach.

About 7+hr; smooth air; we suddenly got a momentary red 'Cabin Altitude'; that immediately went away.  Cabin altitude was steady (5;600 ft for FL350); and no pressure change felt in ears.  Following warning; ALL the cabin O2 masks deployed; with advisories. All checklists were accomplished. PAs made. With clearance; we descended to FL140 initially; determined FAs couldn't cover used masks with walk around bottles; then continued descent to FL100 (10;000 ft). Contacted dispatch; and still had enough fuel to make ZZZZ; rather than divert to ZZZZ1.  All passengers were fine. Possible problem developing from the placarded/deferred Remote Cabin Sensor; which may have given a false cabin pressure reading; or another related sensor having problems.  Spiked reading triggered mask drop. Encourage maintenance to preemptively fix rolling MEL items; and not fly ETOPS aircraft over water that have several MELs deferred.,Captain reported a malfunctioning Remote Cabin Sensor already on MEL failed and caused erroneous cabin altitude readings. This caused the passenger O2 masks to deploy and required an immediate descent. The Crew continued to a destination airport.

Approximately 4 hour and 45 mins into the flight we started to notice a growing imbalance in between the main fuel tanks one and two. The number two side was decreasing in quantity at a much faster rate than the number one side. We got the fuel imbalance caution associated with the issue and as it continued to increase we went to the QRH and settled on the 'fuel leak engine' checklist as it appeared to us that the imbalance could be from a potential leak. As we went through the process the Captain was in conversations with both Flight Operations and Dispatch about where to proceed next. By the time the conversations and checklist had been gone through we were in the best position to continue to ZZZ1. As we made our descent and continued to follow the checklist we secured the engine; as the parameters for doing so were present based on the checklist. We had already [requested priority handling] and continued to land safely at ZZZ1 on one engine per the single engine landing checklist.In the end it appears that the cross feed valve had failed but because there was no power to the valve it displayed itself in the closed position. During the fuel leak checklist it specifies to check the valve is closed which we did; but per the note in the checklist stated that if the circuit breaker was tripped that there would not be an indication of whether the valve was open or closed. I think that creating an item to check the circuit breaker as a set as opposed to just a note would help increase a successful recognition of that possible situation for other crews going forward. Because of the possible time critical situation we were dealing with we followed the steps that we believed to be the correct course of action.,B737 flight crew reported a fuel imbalance developed while at cruise. After the imbalance worsened; the flight crew performed an in flight engine shut down and continued to the destination airport.

As the left main tank quantity was decreasing more rapidly than the right; I had the FO (First Officer) go to the cabin for a visual inspection of the area around the left engine. He returned to the flight deck and reported nothing unusual. All other flight deck switches and indications were normal.Given the rate of the growing imbalance; approaching 700 lbs less in the left versus right tank; we decided to commence the Fuel Imbalance QRH checklist. As the checklist would direct a shutdown of the #1 engine; we requested priority handling with Center and began a diversion to ZZZ. We completed the checklist as we descended; accomplished a single-engine landing; and proceeded to the gate otherwise uneventfully.,B737-700 flight crew reported a growing fuel imbalance during cruise and the subsequent decision for an in-flight engine shut down and diversion to another airport.

After following ECAM procedures the only instruction is to avoid rapid thrust movements. We continued our Climb and our route to ZZZ1. In order to avoid rapid thrust movements; I descended using VS instead of open descent. At approximately 28;000 feet on the arrival the engine made it to idle and I heard an audible bang from the number one engine followed by the ECAM message ENG1 STALL. After accomplishing the first step of the procedure; THR LEVER1....Confirm....IDLE; The engine failed and we got the ECAM message; ENG1 FAIL. We followed the procedure and decided not to restart due to engine damage. We continued into ZZZ1 single ENG and had an uneventful landing. We stopped on the runway to allow inspection of the aircraft. We were given the all clear and taxied to the gate uneventfully. Mechanical anomaly caused by a failure of either the low compressor bleed valve or the variable stator vane.,A321 flight crew reported an ECAM engine problem which led to engine failure resulting in a single engine landing.

We performed the action items and turned off the PTU (power transfer unit) and green system engine driven pump. The Captain informed Dispatch; Maintenance; and briefed the lead Flight Attendant. We agreed with the concurrence of Dispatch that the best course of action was to continue to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and received traffic priority to ZZZ. On final approach; we performed the alternate gear extension checklist and landed on the longest runway (XXR). We stopped straight ahead due to no nose wheel steering and waited for the tug to tow us back to the gate. We completed the after landing flows; tow in checklist; and parking checklist back at the gate.The reason for my fatigue call to the Chief Pilot and scheduling following our incident was due to minimal broken sleep from the previous evening at the layover hotel. The hotel was hosting a fraternity convention and my sleep was disrupted from 1-3 am due to the occupants of the room next door. I called the front desk and they notified security to silence the fraternity party. Following the minimal disrupted rest and the stress associated with the hydraulic emergency; I felt I was not fit to continue duty and called in fatigue!,A319 flight crew reported loss of green hydraulic system while in cruise. After communication with dispatch and maintenance; they elected to request priority handling and continue to destination airport.

At approximately FL360; the CAB PRESS status page displayed showing a cabin altitude of 9;500 feet and rising. Action requested priority handling with ZZZ ATC; started rapid descent to 10;000 feet; seat belt sign on. First Officer (FO) and pilot flying; performed a maneuver with the autopilot on. ATC gave us initial descent to FL270 and a frequency change. New Controller gave us descent to 10;000 feet with altimeter setting of 29.80. We were in VFR conditions; minimum safe altitude from charts approximately 5;000 feet. FO was able to descend quickly enough that a CABIN ALTITUDE ECAM did not trigger nor did the oxygen masks deploy in the cabin. I was able to speak with FA1; during the descent. FA1 confirmed that passengers were okay and did not report any injuries but would update us if something changed. I made a PA to passengers about aircraft condition and plan of action. Requested all to remain seated until in ZZZ.After level off and confirming aircraft was safe to continue; removed the aircraft alert from ZZZ ATC; but requested priority handling into ZZZ. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch. Stated our problem; action; current situation and plan. Received acknowledgment and new fuel remaining calculation for Denver at 10;000 feet. Highest cabin altitude was 11;350 feet. No ECAMs showed on the upper display. Outflow valve; inlet and extract vents all showed closed. During level off; safety valve opened when cabin diff pressure at -.5 PSI. Remaining flight was uneventful to a landing at ZZZ; XXR. Taxi to Gate at XX. Met by ZZZ maintenance and ZZZ FO representative.,A319 Captain reported a rapid descent after cabin pressure became uncontrollable.

Only the artificial horizon; amber SPD flag and amber ALT flag remained. The First Officer PFD retained all data and the B autopilot remained engaged. About a minute after the loss of the Captain PFD; all information returned. A complete review of Airspeed Unreliable checklist was completed. About five minutes later; the problem returned for about double the time (2 minutes). We contacted Dispatch and had them bring 737 Maintenance into the crew phone app connection. After a brief discussion; it was determined the aircraft would be grounded at our destination ZZZZ1 and it would be best to return to ZZZ (350 miles away) to have the problem resolved. We landed in ZZZ uneventfully without declaring an emergency (the Captain's PFD was working normally during the descent and arrival). Background information: Two days prior to our departure; the AML noted a ladder had fallen on the Captain window and AOA (Angle Of Attack) vane. The Captain window was replaced.,B737-800 pilot reported loss of the Captain's PFD in cruise. After discussion with Dispatch and Maintenance; it was decided to perform and air turn back to prevent the aircraft from being grounded at an out station.

We noted airspeed disagree flags illuminated on PFD. I noted erroneous airspeed readings followed by the red stall warning tape and stick shaker warnings. The stick shaker fired continuously until after landing. We completed the memory items for unreliable airspeed. We complied with the QRC and QRH checklist. The First Officer's instruments were determined to be accurate Per QRH checklist. We requested priority handling with Departure; climbed to a safe altitude; and received vectors back to ZZZ for an uneventful landing with Captain's airspeed and altitude unreliable. We coordinated with Dispatch; informed the Flight Attendants; and made a PA to the Passengers. No Passenger issues were noted. After landing; we taxied to the Gate and were told by Ground Control that Airport Ops found that we hit a hawk. The AOA (Angle Of Attack) vane was missing from the aircraft due to the bird strike. Logbook write up was completed and Dispatch helped coordinate all parties for debrief.,B737 flight crew reported a bird strike on takeoff had sheared off the Angle of Attack vane resulting in a loss of airspeed and altitude information and a return to the departure airport.

Aircraft X; ZZZ-ZZZ1. Cruising at FL 380; at XA20 CT; we got an instantaneous #2 Engine LO Quantity 20% and flashing white box. All other oil indications were normal; as well as engine. Prior to event; oil quantities were normal and matched closely. We assessed that we could end up single engine soon; and started looking for nearest suitable airports; if we needed to do that. Additionally; started to review QRC/QRH in preparation for a possible engine failure or shutdown. We coordinated with ZZZ2 Center; for a lower altitude and airspeed. Assigned FL 350; then soon after FL 320. Slowed to74. At XA30 CT; contacted (Company) Dispatch and advised them of our situation; also short conversation with Maintenance. He advised; follow QRH guidance.Top Of Descent; followed soon after; and we continued our assessment of possible landing airports as we monitored the #2 engine. The quantity slowly went down; but would tick up sporadically; then continue down; very slow. While on the arrival branch point; we decided to request preferential coordination direct to ZZZ1. Final approach it was reading 10%; then went to 6% at landing. Landed ZZZ1 Runway XXR uneventfully. While taxi back to terminal; it increased to 20% and remained there at shutdown. Our constant question was; 'what is the limit; zero; or a predetermined %; when the motor would fail?'The next day; I called Maintenance to ascertain if they had found anything out. Maintenance said they were still looking at it with GE Tech Support and had come across Main Bearing and Main Bearing Seal failure; but it wasn't definitive yet. He did tell me that oil was bypassing into another container or void space where it shouldn't go.,B737 Captain reported an Engine Oil Quantity Lo annunciation while at cruise.

These indications flickered on and off and then off. Requested level off to work problem and to stay close to the field. Warning did not come back. From what we saw we believed the problem was just an indication problem that went away. We elected to proceed to ZZZ1. Then almost immediately the Fire warning came back and stayed continuously illuminated with bell only flickering off a few times. Did immediate action items; pulled APU Fire switch and fired the bottle. Requested priority handling. Continued with QRC and Fire illumination did not go away for good so per the QRC we landed at nearest suitable airport; ZZZ. Before landing I notified our FAs (Flight Attendants); notified our Passengers and [contacted] Dispatch. After landing had Fire Rescue trucks inspect aircraft. Once given all clear; we taxied to the gate.,B737 flight crew reported intermittent problems with the APU Overheat/Detection and Fire Warning systems.

This discrepancy was reported to Maintenance and signed off before pushback. The takeoff; climb; and initial phase of cruise were all routine with the exception of slightly more turbulence than normal - nothing more than continuous light and occasional moderate; resulting in the seat belt sign being illuminated slightly longer and the FAs (Flight Attendant) being seated a bit more than normal. West of [the] river; the ride had smoothed out considerably; [so the] seat belt sign [was] off; and flight conditions became VMC.At FL360 approximately 200 NM east of ZZZ; we observed a G RSVR LO LVL ECAM. After running the complete ECAM; the CA (Captain); pilot monitoring; broke out the QRH and reviewed the entire procedure; including all of the INOP systems; most notably: GREEN HYD; SPLR 1+5; N/W STRG; NORM BRK; L/G RETRACT and REVERSER 1. We discussed the ramifications of continuing to ZZZ1 and after consulting Maintenance Control and Dispatch; decided that [requesting priority handling] with ATC and diverting to ZZZ would be the best and safest course of action. Our assumption was that there was a leak in the green hydraulic system as the HYD page indicated almost no fluid remaining in the green system. We were below max landing weight; so we accepted vectors onto the ZZZZZ Arrival and subsequently requested Runway XXL based upon the runway length. We calculated our landing distance to be approximately 6;000 ft. and Dispatch backed us up by calculating a stopping distance of 6;790 ft. Once coordination with Dispatch and Maintenance Control were completed; we ensured all applicable checklists were completed and briefed ATC; the FAs; and the passengers. We elected for the CA to take over as the pilot flying; and I assumed the duties of pilot monitoring during the arrival. We also elected to start the APU.When we were both comfortable with the state of the aircraft; our plan; and the field conditions; we began slowing the aircraft; configuring; and emergency-extended the landing gear at approximately 20 NM on final to Runway XXL. After executing the L/G Gravity Extension Checklist; we received indications that the gear was down and locked with the gear doors open; as expected. Shortly after extending the landing gear; we noticed blue procedural steps on the STS (Status) page for the approach to turn on both the green hydraulic pump and PTU; both of which we had secured in accordance with the original ECAM. After a brief discussion; we elected to turn both items on. However; within approximately one minute; we again saw the G RSVR LO LVL ECAM and promptly secured the green hydraulic pump and PTU in accordance with the ECAM at approximately 10 miles on final with the gear extended. Prior to touchdown; I made the PA call to brace; brace; brace"" followed by a ""remain seated; remain seated"" call as we approached a safe taxi speed on the runway after touchdown. The landing was uneventful and we ended up stopping on centerline using emergency brakes around the 7 board; 9;000 lb. remaining. After the crash crew inspected the aircraft and reported fluid under the #1 engine; Company Maintenance evaluated the aircraft; pinned the landing gear; and initiated a tow to the gate. We executed the Tow-In Procedure and multiple PA announcements were made to keep the passengers in the loop with what was going on prior to and during the tow.""",A320 flight crew reported loss of the green hydraulic system resulted in a diversion and precautionary landing.

We asked ATC for a climb to get above the clouds we were given Flight Level 350. We proceeded to climb to FL350 and turned on the Engine Anti Ice around 270 being in and out of the clouds and the temp was -15C (AT NO time did we ever turn on the Wing Anti Ice). Climbing through FL320 just passed ZZZ1 over the ocean we had a Master Caution/Wing Body Overheat light. I; the Captain; was the Flying Pilot and at once said MY AIRCRAFT and the First Officer got out the checklist to accomplish the Wing Body Overheat emergency/ (my aircraft and radios). The First Officer completed the checklist (did a great job); [received priority] and were going to divert to ZZZ1. After First Officer completed the checklist and the Wing Body Heat light went out we decided to return to ZZZ. ATC gave us direct to ZZZ and I transferred controls to the First Officer and I began to coordinate with ATC; and inform the Flight Attendants; the passengers and Dispatch. While flying back to ZZZ we had to land [overweight]. We chose the longest runway at ZZZ [Runway] XXC and completed the Landing Assessment on the Landing APP; and had plenty of runway to stop the overweight aircraft. Our gross weight on landing XXC ZZZ was 162 kts. and the fuel on board was 30.6k and we landed 40 Flaps 147 knots approach speed. The First Officer landed the aircraft and transferred controls at 60 knots. Exited XXC with no incident and had the Fire Chief take a look at the aircraft on the taxiway. The Fire Chief reported no issues with the aircraft and then taxied back to the gate and filled out the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) with overweight landing and Wing Body Overheat. Thanks for all the ATC controllers help and the emergency personnel. Thanks to the great professionalism of my First Officer and the calmness of our 4 Flight Attendants. Thanks to the Chief Pilot meeting us at the aircraft. Special thanks to all of the training instructors and Check Airmen who prepare us for situations such as the one we experienced.,B737-800 flight crew reported receiving a wing body overheat warning while in climb and cruise. The pilots; in the interest of safety; elected to make a diversion after completing the QRH procedures.

Ran QRC; feeding out of center tanks at the time. Fuel flows even. Fuel imbalance was 1;600 lbs. between main fuel tanks; checklist had us balance. I then contacted Maintenance Control and Dispatch via SATCOM. Decision was to continue and monitor. As a precaution reviewed fuel leak procedure. Woke the Relief Officer and had him check wings and engine. Fluid was streaming out of spoiler area along whole left wing while right wing was dry. At first we thought deice fluid but with the aforementioned fuel configuration and imbalance beginning again we chose to divert to ZZZ1 after consulting First Officers and Dispatch and Maintenance Control via SATCOM a second time. Ran diversion guide and fuel leak procedure. [Requested priority handling] and landed uneventfully in ZZZ1. Stopped on taxiway and had Operations look for fuel leak prior to taxiing to gate. Parked at gate and handled passengers and contacted Chief Pilot. Fuel imbalance at shutdown was 1;000 lbs with the left wing low.,B767 Captain reported diverting after a fuel imbalance and fuel leak were detected resulting in a diversion.

Gear up; and at around 300 ft. AGL we received an engine fire (ECAM; triple chime; master caution; engine fire push button). Above 400 AGL we began ECAM actions; confirmed thrust lever 2 and I pulled it back. Centered the slide slip/beta target. 3 seconds later the ECAM disappeared. ATC told us level 2000; set A/P on and leveled 2000; pulled speed to slightly above green dot. Pulled HDG and turned crosswind. The Captain briefed the flight attendants then passengers. I had loaded the secondary for the ILS XXL in at the gate; so we activated the secondary flight plan. We transferred controls and I briefed the ILS XXL; exchanged back. The Captain noticed Engine #2 N1/N2 were still functional. I slowly added power back in and put #2 in the climb detent. Ran the approach checklist. Once cleared and configured we ran the landing checklist. landed.,A320 Captain reported a fire warning/ECAM/triple chime/Master Caution/Warning and fire handle illuminated on climbout. The flight crew conducted an air turn back and performed a precautionary landing at departure airport.

Symptoms mirrored hypoxia and we donned our Crew O2 Masks; [requested priority handling] with ATC for Crew Members feeling ill and descending normally to 10;000 feet. After flying at 10;000 feet for 10-15 minutes; F/As reported Passengers were feeling better and F/A's were improving; but still felt light headed and remained on POB (Portable Oxygen Bottle). EMS was requested to meet aircraft at the gate. Landing in ZZZ was normal; and Crew and Passengers were evaluated by EMS with no one requesting transport. Maintenance was notified of POB usage.,Air carrier Captain reported during cruise the flight attendants reported physiological symptoms; including a 'bubbling sensation' on skin. Reportedly; passengers also experienced symptoms. After the flight descended; the symptoms dissipated slightly.

This occurred several times and was accompanied by extremely loud mechanical noises which sounded like the nose gear in motion. We suspected that the uplock was not engaging the nose gear. We leveled off and took delay vectors in order to work the issue. First Officer flew the aircraft while I contacted Maintenance through Dispatch via ARINC and came to the conclusion that it was best to return to ZZZ. A return to ZZZ was worked out with ATC. Priority handling was declared by ZZZ Tower. An uneventful landing followed. After landing we had an indication that the left side forward emergency over wing exit had opened. FO (First Officer) told the passengers to remain seated and the aircraft was stopped in order to query the flight attendants on that situation. We were told that the indication was simply from the handle cover falling off. At this point we continued to the gate.,A320 Captain reported a nose gear uplock failure on gear retraction. The flight crew elected to make an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

I was the PM (pilot Monitoring) and to address the ECAM; I had the FO (First Officer) (PF (Pilot Flying)) take the radios so I could address the ECAM and get in the QRH. Executed the ECAM; and referenced page in the QRH. Based on the landing distance chart; we calculated our landing distance at 3.660 ft; and immediately got both Maintenance and Dispatch in the loop. Dispatch also calculated landing distance and to be conservative; we agreed to use 4;000 ft. A few minutes after accomplishing the QRH; ECAMs complete; screens normal; we then got a L spoiler 3 indicating extended. We notified Dispatch and added the 10% fuel penalty. We landed without incident and upon ZZZ1 Maintenance observation; we were notified that there was hydraulic fluid alongside our entire underbelly; which validates the low level reservoir fluid level for the Blue system.,A320 Captain reported a B system hydraulic quantity low ECAM message at cruise and elected to complete the QRH procedures and continue the flight to destination airport.

After saying 'Your Aircraft' to the Captain who was Pilot Flying for this leg and the Captain responding with 'MY AIRCRAFT;' we looked up to the overhead panel and saw the LOW PRESSURE amber light illuminated to the FLT CONTROL B side. I opened the electronic QRH to page X and read the following Condition: 'Hydraulic system pressure to the ailerons. elevators and rudder is low.' After also reading the Objective; we accomplished the only step in the QRH by moving the FLT CONTROL switch on the affected side; after confirmation; to STBY RUD. This action illuminated two other amber lights: YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS. There was no mention in the QRH that these two lights would subsequently light after moving the FLT CONTROL B switch to STBY RUD. After seeing these two additional amber lights; I opened the QRH to review the instructions associated with these 2 amber lights. The FEEL DIFF PRESS QRH step said to continue normal operation but that control column forces may be higher than normal; particularly during the flare. We discussed this as a crew. We then reviewed the YAW DAMPER light QRH steps; followed them and reviewed those instructions as a crew (including not to land with flaps greater than 30 and to avoid moderate or severe turbulence). The YAW DAMPER amber light remained lit after following the QRH steps. After briefly discussing the option to land in ZZZ; the Captain made the decision to return to ZZZ1. I informed ATC of our desire to do a 180 degree turn and return to ZZZ1. The ATC Controller asked why; and I responded; due to a flight control problem. The Controller gave us instructions to turn north and then gave us a clearance to return to ZZZ1. The Controller also asked if we needed further assistance; and I stated not at this time. During the turn back to ZZZ1; it was obvious the YAW DAMPER system was not working as it felt like we would slip and slide through the air in response to every gust of wind. This was even more pronounced on final approach. En route to ZZZ1 we reviewed possible diversion options should we lose hydraulic quantity or pressure but both remained stable; although System A side QTY had reduced to about 80% from 105% at departure. En route; we lowered our altitude to increase fuel burn and reduce fuel on board as much as possible. The APU was also started for that reason. We read the FOM requirements for an overweight landing which clearly state that [priority handling must be requested]. As we checked in with ZZZ1 approach; I [requested priority handling] and our intentions to conduct an overweight landing with a flight control problem in ZZZ1. I asked for Runway XX with no LAHSO (Landing And Hold Short Operations) restriction. The ATC Controller asked for other information like fuel on board in minutes and souls on board. We had XXX souls on board. During final approach the Captain stated the flight controls felt sluggish and I could feel the aircraft slip and slide in the YAW axis. The Captain made a smooth landing at a low vertical rate of descent and we exited the runway and taxied to the gate with no further incident. CFR had been called and they were there along side the runway if needed. Possible blockage in the B side Flight Control Hydraulic lines.No suggestion on how to prevent this; but I would suggest adding additional information to the FLIGHT CONTROL LOW PRESSURE section of the QRH that includes the possibility that the YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS lights could also illuminate and to follow those QRH steps and discuss those flight implications as a crew. The QRH implicitly treats this flight condition as very benign due to the simplicity and lack of info in the QRH for this flight problem. Is a potential blockage in the hydraulic lines to the primary flight controls really a benign condition? A context to the severity or non-severity of this flight condition would be appreciated so that decisions on continuing flight or diverting can be better made.,B737-800 First Officer reported a FLT CONT EICAS light illuminated in cruise. The Flight Crew returned to the departure airport and reported that during landing the flight controls felt sluggish and the aircraft had a yawing motion.

The flaps began to extend but froze at about 0.5 degrees extension.We told ZZZ Approach that we needed to cancel the approach. ZZZ Approach vectored us north on downwind so we could run the appropriate QRH.We determined the correct QRH in this situation to be: Trailing Edge Flap Disagree - The trailing edge flaps are not in the commanded (flap handle) position. There was no asymmetry. We completed the QRH; landed; and taxied to the gate uneventfully.We are awaiting the cause for the flap extension failure from the maintenance investigation. Practicing flap malfunctions in CQ (Continuing Qualification) definitely helped with the flap failure on this flight. Also it's been great practicing early missed approaches in CQ the past 2 years as I got to apply that training on this flight!,B737-900 flight crew reported trailing edge flaps would not move when flap handle was positioned in any setting. The flight crew requested vectors to a new approach and made a precautionary landing at destination airport.

Advised Dispatch; flight attendants; and passengers. Landed on long runway per procedures (direct law - flaps 3) Landing uneventful - taxied to gate. ATC was very cooperative. Notified Dispatch in the air and after gate arrival.Aircraft had previous write ups for same/similar issue. Aircraft had been in ZZZ for 48 hours prior to this flight for same write up. (ECAM F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 and 2) and there was a previous write up for ECAM F/CTL ELAC PITCH TRIM FAULT 2.,A319 flight crew reported loss of both ELAC's (Elevator and Aileron Computer) at cruise.

On Departure SID; leveled off at FL260; in IMC; TAI (Thermal Anti-Ice) on. Shortly after reaching FL260 we saw IAS DISAGREE on CA (Captain) and FO PFDs (Primary Flight Displays). FO's airspeed read about 25 knots less than CA's. Ran Airspeed Unreliable checklist but could not determine which airspeed; if any; was reliable. No probe heat failure was indicated. FO was hand flying aircraft in IMC at FL260 without AP (Autopilot); AT (Autothrottle) or FD (Flight Director). I decided to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ1. Received vectors back to airport for ILS XXC. Planned overweight landing and ran that checklist too. While on vectors to Runway XXC; the IAS DISAGREE messages disappeared from both PFDs and airspeed indications appeared normal again. Continued to ZZZ1 and landed uneventfully but overweight at 150;500 lbs. Landed smoothly and let airplane roll down runway; ARFF confirmed no hot brakes and followed us to the gate. I checked with one of our Technical Pilots two days later to see if a cause for the IAS DISAGREE had been determined. I was told that the FO's pitot tube had been replaced and the airplane had been returned to service.We were in IMC and icing conditions at the onset of the event but engine anti-ice had been selected on as soon as we entered IMC conditions. Again; no indication of a TAI or probe heat failure. Even though the malfunction cleared during decent while on vectors for the approach; I elected to stay with the plan of returning to ZZZ1 without delay which I had communicated to ATC; Dispatch; the FAs and PAX (Passengers). This report is informational only. I have no suggestions.,B737-800 Captain reported an air turn back after receiving an IAS DISAGREE on both PFD's.

We noticed the yellow system showed OVHT in amber and the fluid quantity was at the maximum displayed level. I notified ATC at that time that we were dealing with a hydraulic issue and would be returning to ZZZ. I asked for delay vectors which ATC provided me. I continued to fly while my First Officer complied with the ECAM actions; which we both confirmed. ECAM directed us to shut down the Yellow hydraulic pump and the PTU; which we did. My First Officer then went into the QRH for extra malfunction information and to compute our required landing distance. While doing this I notified the Flight Attendants with a quick update on what was happening and that I would get back to them with the full Brief; and I made a PA announcement to the passengers. I then notified Dispatch and Maintenance over ACARS of our malfunction and our intent to return to ZZZ. I also notified Maintenance over the ZZZ Company maintenance frequency to inform them of our return. We got delay vectors while we performed all these actions. Dispatch sent us landing data and agreed with our intent to return to ZZZ. I then formally requested priority handling with ATC and gave souls on board and fuel and our desire to land on Runway XXR since it was the longest runway available and we had lost some spoiler panels and an engine reverser due to the hydraulic system failure. I also asked for the fire trucks to be present in case of any hydraulic fluid leakage or further incident on landing. I then called the flight attendants back and gave the full brief. The flight attendants were calm; cool and collected during this entire situation and performed remarkably. All emergency action items and briefs were complied with and my First Officer and I agreed with our plan to land back at ZZZ. We both discussed the situation and tried to brainstorm if there was anything that we were missing and there was not. We discussed that the ECAM stated if the overheat indication went away we could renegade the yellow hydraulic system. We discussed that if the overheat went away we would reengage the yellow system at 1;000 ft. AGL for the landing. At approximately 12;000 ft. on the descent the overheat indication went out; yet the fluid system level was still at the maximum level. We planned for a longer final approach since our flaps and slats were operating slower than normal. At 1;000 ft. AGL we reengaged the yellow system; as per the ECAM; since the overheat condition no longer existed. I landed the aircraft uneventfully back into ZZZ on Runway XXR with 16;000 ft. available. We were able to clear the runway uneventfully and did not notice any further yellow system hydraulic overheat. We did notice on taxi in that the yellow hydraulic system fluid level was jumping rapidly from the maximum allowed level to the normal fill line; and back and forth. Once at the gate we spoke with Maintenance and informed them of what we had seen and experienced. They then decided to take the airplane to the hangar for more maintenance troubleshooting. I spoke with the passengers on deplaning and everyone seemed in good spirits. I spoke with company personnel and the Chief Pilot. I advised the Chief Pilot that myself and the First Officer were no longer fit to fly and she had scheduling book us on a deadhead back to base. The Chief Pilot a did an excellent job; was very pleasant and helpful and took care of us very well. I was very impressed. My First Officer and I conducted a facilitated debrief and felt that we performed well during this emergency and did everything we could do to ensure a positive outcome. I also spoke with the flight attendants afterwards along with their Supervisor and let them know I appreciated all they did and that they did a good job. I feel everyone performed excellently during this emergency and did everything we could to make it as benign as possible.,A319 flight crew reported an air turn back and precautionary landing caused by Yellow System hydraulic problems.

Approaching 5 miles; with gear down and approximately 170 kts.; I called for flaps 25 and 30; but the flaps did not move from flaps 15 when the CA (Captain) moved the lever. We accomplished a Normal go-around and I called for flaps 15. After calling for clean maneuvering speed; I called for flaps 5; but the flaps did not move from 15. I reduced power and we set MCP speed below max flap 15 speed. The Captain ran the checklist and we coordinate our plan to land and advised ATC. We landed without incident and had Operations 1 and Fire/rescue look over the plane; then taxied to the gate.I think we handled the emergency well; especially with the all the distractions from ATC; warning horn with gear up and flaps stuck at 15 after go-around; and shifting winds on final.,B737 NG reported a go-around caused by flaps failing to extend to the commanded position. The flight crew elected to fly the approach again and perform a precautionary landing.

We waited a few seconds and a second blue ECAM directed us to turn CTR TANK 2 off and open the XFEED; which we did. We pulled up the fuel page and noticed a 1;400 pound imbalance which is also normal. We continued watching the fuel page and noticed the imbalance rapidly getting worse. We consulted the FM to fuel imbalance and followed the procedure; which was to turn tank 1 off; open XFEED and tank 2 should balance out tank one. The fuel imbalance started increasing at a rapid rate. Tank 2 went UP in fuel while tank one was falling rapidly; now approaching 3;000 pounds lower. I called Dispatch and had him connect me with M/C (Maintenance Control). M/C did not have a solution that we had not already tried. Suspecting a fuel leak; we made the decision to divert to ZZZ. I notified the passengers and flight attendants and we diverted to ZZZ. The fuel imbalance continued to get worse and the autopilot eventually had 3.2 degrees of right rudder in with left bank to keep us flying straight and level. We landed ZZZ and requested ARFF assistance to verify we did not have a fuel leak before taxing to the gate.,A320 flight crew reported a diversion caused by a rapidly changing fuel imbalance.

Passing 9000 feet we got a battery discharge light. We ran QRH which directed us to land at nearest suitable airport. After coordinating with ATC; Dispatch; our crew and passengers; we returned to ZZZ; where we swapped planes and continued to ZZZ1. We did not declare an emergency nor request special handling and treated the situation as a non-emergency maintenance issue requiring RTB (Return To Base).On the initial flight; prior to push; we got an ELEC light; indicating a problem with the standby system. We were also told this was the aircraft's first flight of the day; so it might have come from the maintenance hangar. We called Maintenance and they quickly reset the system and no errors showed. The book was signed off and we departed; only to get the battery discharge after departure.,B737-800 Captain reported an ELEC light illuminated in flight and elected to make an air turn back to departure airport.

We verified what indication we had and I called for the QRH Checklist. After we completed that; I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them and Maintenance know our issue. As we continued we did notice a decrease in the A System quantity; but the pressure remained steady. Around 40 minutes later; the B System Engine Driven pump Low Pressure light also illuminated. I called for and we ran the same checklist for the Low Pressure light. We continued to have normal system pressure on the hydraulic pressure gauges so we decided to continue the flight. I instructed the First Officer to send another ACARS message to Dispatch; which he did.At this point; we ran through some possible scenarios and began to prepare for an A System failure. We input data for a normal and A System failure landing into the Weight and Balance. Then we discussed what might happen; once we started to put a higher load on the hydraulic system; such as lowering the gear and flaps; using thrust reverse and nose wheel steering. It became apparent to us that while we were operating normally; our situation could change rapidly. It was at this point we decided to advise ATC and proceed directly to ZZZ. We notified ATC of our hydraulic malfunction and our intention to go directly to our destination. I then asked the First Officer to notify Dispatch of our request for priority handling. He did via ACARS. I contacted the Flight Attendants and briefed them on what we planned to be a normal landing; but that we had requested priority handling and to expect to see the CFR vehicles near the runway.I also briefed the Passengers about the same situation. ATC cleared us direct to the airport and we started our descent. During the Approach Briefing; we had discussed configuring early to allow time for the electric pump gear and flap extension. Those worked as expected and we maintained normal pressure on the hydraulic gauges. The landing was normal. Thrust reverse and spoiler extension operated normally with the slightest of flicker from the Electric Pump Low Pressure lights as mentioned in the QRH. I even had normal nose wheel steering. We cleared the runway and I asked that CFR inspect the aircraft for any visible leaks. They saw none; so we continued to the gate in ZZZ. Upon arrival at the gate; I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. I then wrote up the Two Low Pressure light indications in the logbook.,B737-700 Captain reported hydraulic pump problems in cruise and elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

I was a dead heading pilot sitting in [seat] X. I was called to the cockpit by the Captain whom I flew with during the course of this 4 day trip. In addition; I was PM (Pilot Monitoring) on Aircraft X; ZZZ-ZZZZ. I have flown the Airbus [for many years] for various carriers. In addition [to] being a Line Pilot; Captain and First Officer; I have also been an instructor [for] Airbus.  The Captain felt that I could be of use to his very well qualified crew as a third member in the cockpit. Let me be clear to say that the First Officer; the PF (Pilot Flying); was a former [other Airline] pilot who had thousands of hours of experience. The Captain had well over 5;000 hours in the seat. My role in the event was support alone. When the FA (Flight Attendant) came back to inform me that the Captain requested my presence in the flight deck; I knew what that meant. I grabbed my IPad and proceeded to the cockpit. Once inside; the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) told me everything system wise and the PFD indicated that the crew was in Alternate Law. The FO (First Officer) was hand flying the aircraft and we were at FL260. I took my place in the jump seat and asked how I could be of assistance. The Captain passed the radio comms to me while the FO flew. It's one thing to fly around at 5;000 ft. while demonstrating Alternate Law and it's quite another to be fully immersed in an aircraft that is making uncommanded movements via pitch; be in turbulence at FL260; all while speaking with ZZZZ Air Traffic Controllers. The PF was doing a great job. I took Com 1. The Captain was trying the [to] contact Dispatch/Maintenance control via the crew phone but was having trouble with 2 way cutting out. I went to the FOM and provided him with ARINC (Commercial Radio) freq to call ZZZ1 radio. While he was doing that; I was speaking with ATC; coordinating descent and making inputs to the FCU (Fuel Control Unit). Again; the FO was very actively flying the aircraft and doing a great job. I then focused on systems. The overhead indications were 'lights out' which ordinarily would mean the flight control computers were working. Except the ECAM said they weren't. I then pushed the F/CTL page and all indications were green. Again; would look normal. Except something was happening because clearly we were in alternate law. I researched QRH for a reset but it was for On Ground Only. There was no reset. I then looked in Comply AOM for information. I also referenced the QRH within Comply. The Captain was very busy; the FO was busy flying; I am doing the radios and referencing manuals. In addition; my role is simply support so at appropriate times I informed the CA (Captain)/FO about what they had systems wise and what was going to happen systems and performance wise when we degraded to Direct law. Referred to the NNP (Non Normal Performance) pages of QRH; did their landing distance computation; and also reminded the crew that when determining Vapp to make corrections off of flaps full speed before selecting flaps 3. Captain requested backup for non routine landing considerations. At all times he was in command and my role was to have the appropriate manuals out and ready for when he requested. This crew was also dealing with the normal communication issues facing every crew on every flight. Task saturation; communication barriers; airspace closures related to military airspace requiring the crew to NOT be able to proceed directly to the divert airport; dark and turbulent versus dark and stormy; communication barriers with ATC; and balancing the need to follow the ECAM with the need to reference other manuals. In addition; at least 2 times the cockpit crew was interrupted by communication not from the number 1 FA (Flight Attendant) but from the rear flight attendants. They meant well but their concerns weren't relevant and not helpful.  This crew did a great jobmanaging the serious issues and I was happy to assist. On final I did suggest configuring to flaps 3; on speed; before gear down command since the plane would be trimmed already making it easier on the FO to fly. He did a great job.Please put the ARINC freq map back in the QRH. Please tab the QRH although I tab mine myself.,A319 Pilot reported loss of both ELACs while at cruise and assisted the Flight Crew in handling the situation. The aircraft landed safely at destination airport.

They had replaced the #1 engine driven hydraulic pump and supply line. The preceding crew also wrote up the #2 B system engine driven hydraulic low pressure light illumination; which Maintenance Operations checked and could not duplicate. Start up through take off were normal. When the Captain raised the gear after takeoff; he noticed a Master Caution FLT CONT light flicker on; then immediately off. At a safer altitude; we both looked around more and found no abnormal indications; so we continued the departure to ZZZ2. In cruise at FL 400; the #1 engine driven hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. The QRH led us to turn off that pump. Both hydraulic systems showed normal pressure and quantity at that point; so we continued to ZZZ2.During the descent with throttles at idle; the #1 oil filter bypass light illuminated. This time the QRH directed a #1 engine shutdown. We transferred aircraft control to the Captain; [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Approach; requested and received extra vectors for time from Approach; completed the QRH Checklist for engine shutdown and single engine landing; and landed flaps 15. Landing and taxi to the gate were otherwise normal. By the time we set the parking brake at the gate; #1 hydraulic quantity; as I recall; showed 37% RF (Re Fill). On post flight walk around; a hydraulic fluid leak from the #1 engine was obvious; and the ground crew had placed a catch box with litter under the leak. Both oil quantities read 100% at post flight.,Flight crew reported multiple systems failures after take off and climb. The crew performed an in flight shut down of the affected engine and continued to the destination airport.

Takeoff roll on Runway XXL was uneventful. On climb out; Pilot Monitoring noticed the autothrottle (A/T) disengaged and re-engaged it. It happened a second time with the same results. The number 2 engine had trouble exactly matching the commanded climb thrust. I also reengaged the A/T at least once. After engaging the autopilot around 5-6;000 ft. MSL; Pilot Flying noticed excess yaw and roll and disengaged autopilot. Both pilots noticed the number 2 engine was at approximately 60 percent N1 with a white arc showing commanded vs actual position. There were no other engine indications or abnormalities. The crew accomplished Immediate Action Items for the 'Engine Limit or Surge or Stall' checklist. Pilot Monitoring requested an intermediate level off at 10;000 ft. and continued course. Captain gave First Officer radios and Pilot Flying duties shortly after leveling of at 10;000 ft.After the turn at ZZZZZ on the ZZZZZ2; ZZZZZ1 SID; ATC gave vectors to remain in the local area. Aircraft was at 10;000 ft. MSL; 230 KIAS near location west of ZZZ. The crew ran the remainder of Quick Reference Handbook for 'Engine Limit or Surge or Stall' checklist and coordinated with local Maintenance and Maintenance Control/Dispatch; notified passengers and FM. Requesting priority handling by ATC and crew simultaneously when 20-25 minutes into flight the engine rolled back and failed. Crew ran the 'Engine Failure or Shutdown' checklist and the 'One Engine Inoperative Landing' checklist. Crew planned and executed an overweight; single engine; return to ZZZ. To land below max landing weight we would have needed to fly for roughly 2 more hours. A planned overweight visual approach to Runway YYL via vectors to a 10-mile final with 15-flaps was uneventful with a smooth landing. Crew taxied to Gate XX and shut down the remaining engine to wait for baggage/pallet carts to be moved and then tow-in.No sooner than we had parked; Crew Scheduling called me; notifying us that we would be leaving in roughly 65 minutes to ZZZ1. We decided that we needed to re-evaluate our fitness for duty and needed to speak to Union representation before proceeding any further. We then spoke to Maintenance Control over the phone and then hub maintenance at the aircraft to discuss the events. We had noticed that the Fuel Pump Package had been replaced that morning with an engine run accomplished. The number 2 HMU; Heat Exchanger and Fuel Pump were replaced following the engine failure in flight. A member of the Chief Pilot's office; and later the Chief Pilot; met us at the aircraft to check on us; coordinate with Company (scheduling; Chief Pilot; etc) and accomplish a [safety evaluation]. We reached a mutual conclusion it was not in the best interests of safety to fly as we were still processing the chain of events during the flight and the associated stress/workload.We accomplished a thorough debrief and reconstruction of the flight. Preflight: Both of us woke early due to the nature of the schedule. It was day 2 of the 4-day pairing; with an early show ZZZ2-ZZZ3 on day 1. Originally scheduled to fly ZZZ3-ZZZ; the pairing had been changed to a deadhead due to equipment substitution. The evening was relaxing and we were both asleep early. I slept from XA:00 pm until XJ:30am. In the morning I had a very long hold time with the Company's Agent on Demand before van pickup time at XM:02 AM. The flight plan was released while I was getting ready for the van ride. I knew we had a longer van ride; so I did not expect this to be a problem. We left the hotel on time and reviewed the flight plan en route. We were scheduled for a random southerly route ZZZ-ZZZ1 at FL300 due to significant impacts from turbulence and convective activity/SIGMETS; increasing the complexity. The Dispatcher had asked the Captain to call regarding this flight; which I did during the van ride. We both had significant distractions with thefunctioning of the weather app on our EFBs (this is an ongoing issue where it attempts to connect and then drops connectivity).On arriving at the airport; we had the additional task of [Covid procedures]. I went to the mission planning area while the First Officer went to the aircraft to begin the preflight to save time. The 45-minute report time was compressed; especially with the additional attention to weather/turbulence and verifying the random route points. Fortunately; we departed Gate XY; close to the satellite mission planning room; saving some time. There was some pressure from the Gate Agents for us to leave and then the ramp personnel were waiting for us to push. I used CRM and our company process approach to ensure everything was ready to go before releasing brakes. Taxi: We planned Runway ZZR for departure; and Ground Control changed us to ZZL. I called for the runway change procedure and we were split-task for a few minutes to update the required information. The remainder of the taxi out was uneventful.,B737 flight crew reported an engine failure after take off; resulting in an air turnback and precautionary landing at the departure airport.

I saw the left engine indications winding down. Requested priority handling and requested return to ZZZ. Moments after initial indications; fire warning activated; so ran we the engine fire checklist. After pulling fire handle fire indications stopped so we didn't fire the extinguisher bottle. Rest of the event went just like training in the sim; followed the checklists and landed safely on the long Runway XX. Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting inspected and followed us to the Gate. Single engine time was approximately 20 minutes.,Captain reported engine failure and engine fire warning on climb out. The light crew elected to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

Roles:Captain: Pilot Monitoring (PM)First Officer (FO): Pilot Flying (PF)Deadhead FO: DH PilotAt approximately XA:20 while approaching way point ZZZZZ on Airway at FL380 the autopilot #2 disengaged with an associated ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF. After an evaluation and finding no cause for the autopilot disengagement the autopilot #2 was re-engaged. Within minutes the aircraft pitched up slightly; as if in mountain wave; climbing approximately 70 ft. above the cruise altitude and an ECAM message F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 displayed. The aircraft then slightly pitched down to 70 ft. below cruise altitude and immediately ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF; F/CTL ALT LAW (PROT LOST) and F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 2 displayed. Pilot Flying began hand flying the aircraft. We began the ECAM Procedures. I called the #1 Flight Attendant and instructed him to have the deadheading First Officer come to the cockpit immediately. Deadhead Pilot and I re-evaluated the systems failures and determined that the systems/computers could not be recovered. I then [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and requested FL260 since we could not stay in RSVM airspace without an autopilot. This also allowed a wider airspeed regime between Vmo and Alfa PROT in case pitch control became more of problem. Pilot Flying noted that the control input forces were increasing as we descended at 280 kt. indicated. We attempted to manually trim the aircraft with the pitch trim wheel; but the stabilizer appeared jammed at -0.8 up. I attempted to call Dispatch desk via the Crew Call app but reception was poor. Deadhead pilot looked up the ZZZ Commercial Radio frequency for me and I established communication with the Dispatcher and Airbus Maintenance desk. Maintenance advised us that if there was not a fix in the QRH there was nothing he could do for us. The aircraft was under control and Pilot Flying was able to override the now mistrimmed stabilizer with his side stick. The three of us and the Dispatcher then began discussions on diverting to the closest long runway. Something in the 8;000 to 10;000 ft. length range with airspace enough to configure; evaluate and handle any pitch problems that may present itself as we configured for landing. The four of use decided it was prudent to divert to ZZZ1 which was 140 NM away (120 miles closer than ZZZ2).I [requested priority handling] and informed ZZZZ Center that we were experiencing a flight control problem and request vectors to ZZZ1. ZZZZ gave us an off-airway vectors of 090deg then 100deg so to fly around restricted airspace while ZZZZ called for permission for use to fly through the restricted airspace direct to ZZZ1. I asked Deadhead Pilot to handle the radio communications while I briefed the flight attendant and passengers on the diversion and anticipated non-routine landing. The flight attendants were briefed for a non-routine landing. When done with cabin briefings and passenger address my attention returned to Pilot Flying and Deadhead Pilot. By this time; we had been handed off to ZZZ Center. I found that we were still flying the 100 degree heading. I queried ZZZ Center for the reason of this extended vector and was told it was because of restricted airspace to our north. I firmly reminded the Controller we were an aircraft in distress with flight control problem [and] that we had [requested priority handling] and if this vector continues; we're going to have fuel problems. I informed him this diversion was becoming pointless since the object of the diversion was to get this aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. I added that I could have been in ZZZ3 by now. We were immediately given a north heading towards ZZZ2.Approximately 20 minutes before landing passing 15;000 ft. (SAT-26) the pitch trimwheel lurched nose down a few inches and began trimming normally. Pilot Flying commented that side stick input forces became normal. The stabilizer continued to trim normally during all speed and configurations changes as flaps were extended. The ECAM messages remained displayed. Deadhead Pilot had completed a landing distance assessment using a non-normal; DIRECT LAW calculation. (Note: A non-normal; stabilizer jam calculation resulted in the same distance) We asked for and received a 20 NM final approach. We completed our applicable checklists and informed the Flight Attendants that we were 10 minutes from landing.Pilot Flying; Deadhead Pilot and I briefed that we would be fully configured and 160 kts. prior to gear extension so that only small a small amount of pitch trim would be required to stabilize the approach when the flight control system degrades to DIRECT LAW. Pilot Flying landed the aircraft perfectly and we rolled out; turned off the runway to taxi to the gate. Pilot Flying commented the aircraft required a firmer side stick input to flare due to the Direct Mode. I made a passenger address assuring them of our safety and thanking them for their cooperation with the Flight Attendant's instruction.I met with the Mechanic meeting our flight and briefed him on our experienced. He was grateful we had stayed to discuss the failures with him. When we blocked in and shut down the engines all the ECAM messages had cleared and only an ECAM Class II F/CTL indication remained. The faults remained in the Multipurpose Control Display Unit>Maintenance>Current Flight Report print out. Deadhead Pilot and I had operated Aircraft X/DATE that morning down to ZZZZ1. Starting the initial decent on the ZZZZZ1 2A STAR into ZZZZ1 we had experienced three autopilot disconnects. The first two occurred prior to the way point ZZZZZ3 on the STAR. ZZZZZ3 was to be crossed between FL230 and FL210. Prior to the third disconnect I saw the pitch trim wheel jerk forward approximately an inch. An ECAM warning would flash on the display then disappear. Descending below FL180 the autopilot was re-engaged and was used for the remainder of the STAR and RWY XXR LOC and GS capture. The pitch trim worked normally as we slowed on the arrival and configured for landing.At gate arrival in ZZZZ1; we called for Maintenance and described what we experienced. Maintenance printed a Maintenance Current Flight Report from the Multipurpose Control Display Unit which indicated warns of XU:23 AUTO FLT AP OFF and XU:27 F/CTL. Failure messages were: XU:21 AFS:ELAC1 and XU:25 AFS:ELAC1. There was a Class II Maintenance Message F/CTL displayed on the Status page. Maintenance went to work clearing these faults.I could not have hopped for a better qualified crew to meet this challenge. I had flown with Deadhead Pilot before; but this was my first flight with Pilot Flying. Deadhead Pilot brought 30 years of Airbus experience to the flight deck including time at various airlines. Pilot Flying brought 22 years of Airbus experience to the flight. Their performance was both profession and stellar. They never stopped working the problem. Flight Attendant 1; Flight Attendant 3; Flight Attendant 4 worked as a team preparing our passengers for a non-routine landing and keeping communications to the cockpit to a minimum during this diversion allowing us to work the problem uninterrupted. I would recommend that Dispatch and Commercial Radio VHF frequency pages found in the FOM be included in the QRH for easier referencing.,Pilot reported ELAC failure at cruise. The Flight Crew elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

After checking for and noting full quantity and pressure in System A; we ran the QRH Checklist which consisted of turning the pump off. A little over a half hour later; we noticed decreasing hydraulic quantity in System A; it went as low as 11% (but pressure stayed constant at approximately 3;000 PSI throughout the flight). Shortly thereafter; on the initial descent into ZZZ1; we got a LOW PRESSURE caution for the ENG 2 Hydraulic Pump on System B. We again ran the same QRH procedure and switched off that hydraulic pump. Even though the electric pumps were maintaining full hydraulic pressure; we were concerned that we had a limited amount of time before significant functional degradation of our hydraulic systems began; particularly with the fluid loss on System A. Knowing at that point that we were due to receive the standard long; low-altitude vectors into ZZZ1; we requested priority handling and received priority handling for a long; straight-in approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ1. We configured early and everything went normally concluding in a 40-degree flap landing. After landing we carefully checked that hydraulic pressure was still normal on both sides (it was) and had the responding Fire Crews check for visible external fluid leaks. The responding crews did not notice any leaks/fluid and System A Hydraulic Quantity had stabilized at 20%; so we taxied into the gate.,B737-700 First Officer reported problems with the engine driven hydraulic pumps resulting in requesting priority handling and a precautionary landing at destination airport.

Autopilot 2; Auto Thrust; First Officer Primary Flight Display; Navigation Display; and lower Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor were all failed. I took controls and Comms while First Officer commenced Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor actions. Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors displayed in order: Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio Mode fault; AC Bus 2 fail; DC Bus 2 fail; Gen 2 fault; NAV LS tuning disagree. I engaged Auto Pilot 1; while manually adjusting thrust. I performed a radio check with ATC and informed them we were dealing with an electrical fault; however no assistance was required. Lead Flight Attendant called to inform us all power and lights were out in the cabin.When [the] First Officer performed Gen 2 fault Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor; the Gen Reset; and we regained AC and DC bus 2. We realized then we had experienced a Gen 2 Trip and the Bus Tie had not worked; resulting in the loss of two main busses. The Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio MODE fault did not clear. We attempted the published FM reset for this malfunction and it did not work. With [the] situation stabilized; First Officer took controls back; and we agreed to descend to FL 310 per FM guidance to improve APU start capability. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control while [the] First Officer coordinated altitude change for APU start.At this point Gen 2 failed again; however; this time; the bus tie operated correctly and we did not lose AC and DC bus2. Gen 1 powered all busses except normal galley shed. Reset of Gen 2 did not work this time. The First Officer descended to FL310 and started the APU. Bus tie worked and APU Gen successfully powered right side of electrical system. First Officer climbed aircraft back to FL350 to exit a layer of IMC at FL310. Finally able to consult with Maintenance Control after the latest Gen fault; they confirmed from their report downloads what we assessed from all of the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor cautions.They asked us to attempt another reset of the Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio mode; which was unsuccessful. We operated the remainder of the flight with both engines in N1 degraded mode. Maintenance Control opined that; although the electrical system was currently powered; there were questions about the efficacy of the bus tie system; and any subsequent potential electrical faults made it prudent to not continue flight to ZZZ1; but rather stop short. Flight crew and Dispatch agreed. Dispatch mentioned ZZZ2; which we had just passed. First Officer and I felt it was just as safe to continue to ZZZ3.By the time we could perform all of our briefs and planning we we would be descending to ZZZ3 and we were about 45 [to] 50 minutes away. The weather was good; and it would be better for our passengers and maintenance. Maintenance Control and Dispatch agreed that a divert to ZZZ3 was a great option. I took the controls back; the First Officer coordinated clearance to ZZZ3 via the ZZZZZ arrival. We did not request priority. We conducted a visual approach and uneventful landing to Runway XXC at ZZZ3.,A319 flight crew reported the loss of number 2 generator in flight with the bus cross tie breaker not operating caused a load shedding event. The flight crew elected to descend to improve APU in flight start performance. The flight crew elected to divert and make a precautionary landing after number 2 generator tripped again.

When the Tech Operations staff were finished; appropriate MELs were applied including 32-XX-XX inoperative. We complied with the MEL's required O procedures and left the gate at XA54z with 17+1 passengers. First Officer was the PF (Pilot Flying) then as per the MEL a TOGA takeoff was performed at XB10z.After reaching cruise altitude IMC southwest of ZZZ2; we received dashboard fault annunciations and LGCIU 1 fault ECAM. Non-normal SOP's were followed; the FO continued as PF and ECAM steps were performed followed by associated QRH procedures. Multiple systems were inoperative including normal gear extension; nosewheel steering; auto pilot; auto thrust; flight directors and wing anti-ice (operative for 30 seconds after selection). We decided; based on the current winter weather at our destination ZZZ1 along with reported icing conditions; to return to ZZZ. There was a large low weather system advancing northeasterly. ZZZ1 weather was 1SM -SN and OVC004. ZZZ weather was 10SM and BKN055.We requested a diversion back to ZZZ from ATC. ACARS message was sent to Dispatch. Captain communicated with the flight attendants and passengers. During the descent; the Captain took over PF duties. The First Officer reviewed the QRH and inoperative systems. Radar vectors were requested to the current runway in use; [Runway] XXR. After we both had reviewed the inoperative systems we discussed the manual gear extension steps and whether or not to declare an emergency. About this time ZZZ contacted us and informed us CFR would be standing by and that they had chosen to [request priority handling]. Subsequently Approach asked us if we could accept a visual approach Runway XXL. We had sent for landing data to both XX runways. As our landing weight was 116;400 lbs; VMC weather; and dry runway; we informed them we could accept XXL.The landing gear was lowered in accordance with the QRH. Three down and locked indications were verified. The approach and landing were uneventful. Differential braking was used to taxi clear of the runway. The aircraft was stopped; parking brake set and we contacted operations to coordinate a tow back to the gate.,A320 Captain reported departing airport with LGICU 2 on MEL. Upon reaching cruise altitude; LGICU 1 ECAM is received. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and make a precautionary landing at departure airport.

The Flight Attendants in the rear of the aircraft said they could also smell a burning smell. We had no indication of cabin smoke in the cockpit or any sort of fire alerts. We went back and forth between planning a diversion and talking to the Flight Attendants about the smoke in the cabin which the lead Flight Attendant advised was still visible. We communicated with Dispatch our need to divert and land the plane as soon as practical. We made a decision to [request priority handling] to ZZZ and have [airport support personnel] equipment standing by. We preformed all necessary checklist for smoke/fire in cabin; Flight Attendant briefing; passenger notification; overweight landings and diversion prior to landing. On our way to ZZZ the lead Flight Attendant advised us that the smoke was no longer visible but there was still a burning smell. After landing the aircraft; the rescue and fire trucks inspected the exterior of the aircraft for any indication of fire. After the [airport support personnel] advised us there was no sign of fire; we proceeded to the gate to park the aircraft. After parking the [airport support personnel] came on board the aircraft inspected for any fire; smoke or areas of burning equipment.,Air Carrier First Officer reported being notified by the Lead Flight Attendant of visible smoke and electrical burning odor in the passenger cabin. After conferring with Dispatch and Flight Attendant the flight crew executed a safe air diversion.

ECAM - hyd g rsvr lo level and hyd g eng 1 pump lo pr. Actions coordinated a hold with approach control to hold over ZZZZZ to afford us the time to troubleshoot and coordinate a plan prior to our approach into ZZZ. Executed the 'non-normal' associated with the above ECAMS. Based on the status of the multiple failures associated with loss of green hydraulic system we declared flight 54 a priority aircraft with approach control for planning purposes. Contacted ZZZ Maintenance on VHF to foster a cohesive plan and review of the potential steps we would anticipate prior to our approach into ZZZ. Highlighted items discussed were alternate gear extension and no steering capability which will result in being towed off of the Runway. After discussion with Maintenance discussed the plan with my First Officer to find a shared mental model on which approach and expectations/cautions in what to anticipate before and after landing. I then followed up with communicating with the flight attendants providing them the test and then communicating with our customers. Approach phase coordinated a minimum of a 10 mile final with ATC. Actively reviewed and recalled ECAM ACTIONS with First Officer. Anticipating executing the Alt gear ext procedure we recalled the status page on lower ECAM related to approach procedure; ECAM directs us to turn on no.#1 eng hydraulic pump. Upon doing so; all malfunctions and status items were cleared and found normal. Landed with no degradation and taxied on our own power to the terminal. Advised flight attendants to remain seated and all was ok.,A320 pilot reported loss of Green Hydraulic system fluid and a Green Hydraulics System EDP low pressure ECAM message. The flight crew elected to hold for additional time for trouble shooting; the continued the approach to make a precautionary landing at destination airport.

We pushed the throttle up but the engine continued to rolled back and eventually failed. We ran the Engine Failure Checklist and then the drift down checklist. The engine indications were normal so we descended to FL 240 to attempt a restart because that was the top of the inflight restart envelope. It seemed to be starting normally except we never got light off so after 30 seconds we terminated the restart attempt. We had sent several messages to Dispatch but ACARS coverage was pretty spotty. We eventually got in touch with Dispatch and agreed ZZZ was a good diversion destination. We had already [requested priority handling]. ATC cleared us directly to a fix on the final approach for the ILS XX. Since I had just finished recurrent last Wednesday I became to pilot flying. Name; the First Officer reviewed all the checklist I had already done and previewed the single engine landing checklist plus we both reviewed the single engine go around if needed. Flew a flaps 15 single engine approach and landing without incident. Exited near the end of the Runway and taxied to a parking spot. Spoke with the Chief Pilot; Maintenance Control; and the crew desk. Overall other than the spotty ACARS coverage I think it went very well.,Captain reported a #1 engine roll back at cruise. The Flight Crew attempted a restart; but was unsuccessful and returned to land at the departure airport.

The inbound crew had experienced an ELAC1 fault in cruise late in the flight which resolved to normal operations somewhere in the descent. I was deadheading in the cabin on the inbound flight and was advised of the ELAC issue at the gate where I took the place of the FO (First Officer) who operated the inbound flight. He was illegal for the leg back to ZZZ1 and took a seat in the cabin to deadhead back to ZZZ1. Maintenance was advised of the issue on the inbound flight and Mechanics came onboard to evaluate. No remaining problems were found and the aircraft was deemed safe for flight. Departure; climb and initial cruise at FL380 were normal until about two hours into the flight. First we got an ELAC1 pitch trim fault and automatic autopilot disconnect. There were no ECAM actions to perform and we reengaged the autopilot. While analyzing the effect of the failure we got an ELAC2 pitch trim fault and the autopilot disconnected once again. The Captain requested a descent from ZZZZ Center as we were no longer RVSM compliant and then he called the 1st FA (Flight Attendant) and requested the deadheading FO be sent to the cockpit. Having the extra crew member in the cockpit was very helpful as he assisted with the radios; systems research and a variety of other tasks. I was hand flying the descent to FL260 and then FL240 due to turbulence while the three of us discussed our options. Although the display said to use manual trim; the trim wheel was frozen in place and could not be adjusted. Control pressure in pitch was light and even though we had no pitch trim available; hand flying the aircraft was not difficult. At this point we were in alternate law and even though control was not difficult; hand flying the aircraft required constant adjustments and was significantly touchier than hand flying a fully functional aircraft. The Captain attempted to contact Maintenance but was unsuccessful. We decided the situation warranted [an alert] and since ZZZ2 appeared significantly closer we decided to divert. After further discussion of our frozen pitch trim we decided advising ATC was appropriate. En route to ZZZ2 we were given lengthy vectors around military airspace which was unexpected since we had requested priority handling. In the descent to ZZZ2 the pitch trim became usable again and the approach and landing were uneventful.,A319 F/O reported failure of ELAC 1 and ELAC 2 during cruise so the flight crew elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

The pressurization page came up and we observed 4;000 FPM. We immediately stopped our climb at 13;000 ft. When the plane leveled off and the power came back the cabin altitude and vertical speed stabilized. We had no ECAMs or warning or cautions. We asked to descend to 12;000 ft. Cabin altitude was operating normally. We asked to climb to 15;000 ft and when the power came up and we began to climb the same happened.We immediately ask for a descent to 10;000 ft. Again the cabin altitude and the rate of climb/descent was normal. We elected to [request priority handling] asked to hold at 10;000 ft. to burn fuel so as not to have an overweight landing. The cabin altitude stayed at 900 ft. during the hold. On descent for the approach the jump seaters noticed the cabin alt go into a slight climb for a few minutes than return to normal. [We had an] uneventful landing. [The problem was] high pressure air and pressurization computers malfunctioning [due to it being an] older aircraft. Some of the aircraft are old. Mechanical malfunctions will occur although in my years with the Airline they are very rare.,A320 Pilot reported cabin pressure control failure on climb and performed an air turn back and landing at departure airport.

At FL 250 about 12 miles west of the SPINK intersection the aircraft shuddered then rolled left rapidly and the nose yawed. I immediately grasped the yoke and not sure if I turned off the autopilot or if it disengaged; but I rolled the aircraft back to level flight. I was looking outside and saw the roll coming back through 10 degrees; I asked the F/O if he saw how far left we banked. He said he thought 20 degrees. I called back to see if the F/A's were ok. They said three of them were in the aft galley and had been tossed around and the contents of the aft galley bins had been thrown on the floor. Cans; drinks and ice. One F/A was in the aisle and said she had been able to brace against a seat. No one reported any injuries at this time. We asked ATC what we were following and they reported a (other carrier) aircraft. I noted the wind at altitude was 280/20 which was a direct tailwind to our track. As we continued we got occasional buffeting which may have been wake related. As we got in the terminal area; ATC issued a visual and I attempted to remain above the A330's flight path on final. I even slowed more to allow more distance between us. I flew one dot high on the ILS glideslope yet at 800 ft AGL; we encountered another minor roll event. Aircraft remained controllable and we continued normally. On the ground; post flight; I spoke with all four F/A's; again asking if they had any injuries. They said just sore and possible bruising from being tossed against the aft galley but did not say they were injured.While we were 12 miles in trail; we had no idea we were following a heavy. Perhaps more in trail spacing for heavy and 737 types.,B737-800 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence on descent into PHX in trail of an A330.

FO (First Officer)  and I proceeded to the ZZZ2 flight and when I arrived I was told by the Gate Agent that all passengers were either onboard or in the jet way waiting to board. As I made my way down to the aircraft I found approximately 15 passengers were still on the jet way and that the flight attendants had stopped the boarding process due to the ground power tripping off line and the aircraft being dark. The aircraft was also very warm and there was a musty smell in the cabin. Since the ground air conditioning had never been hooked up and the APU was not started; I assumed that this odor was a result of the aircraft sitting for a period of time in rainy and very humid conditions with no air circulation. I immediately started the APU and applied bleed air to the packs and the boarding process was completed. FO and I completed out pre-flight preparations and we pushed of the gate and taxied to Runway XXC and departed uneventfully. Passing 8;000 ft. on our climb out; we received a call from a flight attendant stating that a passenger was complaining of an irritating odor and a burning sensation in her eyes. I asked the FA (Flight Attendant) if they were experiencing the same thing and was told that they could still smell the musty; sweaty socks odor but no eye irritation. At that point I suggested that we wait a few minutes to see if the odor dissipates thinking that it may just be some moisture in the AC system that would burn off. After about five minutes I called all flight attendant stations for an update and I asked for a consensus on whether the odor was getting better or worse or staying the same. All the FA's agreed that the odor seemed to be subsiding and they were OK with proceeding to ZZZ1. It was then when FO stated that he could still smell the odor and that he was developing a headache. At that point I decided that we needed to return to ZZZ. After [advising ATC] we were cleared direct to ZZZ and we started our descent; notified Dispatch and ZZZ operation; completed all applicable check lists; QRH procedures and the over weight landing assessment. We touched down on Runway XXC in ZZZ at a weight of 188;800 lbs at 155 IAS and taxied to the gate uneventfully. At the gate all passengers were deplaned and I made the appropriate logbook entries in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook. The flight attendants were met by someone who I believed to be an in flight Supervisor and were escorted off the jet way by them. FO and myself were the last two off the aircraft and when we reached the gate area; the flight attendants and the in flight Supervisor were nowhere to be seen.,Air Carrier flight crew reported a fume event during climb described as musty 'locker room' odor. The Captain elected to request priority handling to execute an air return to departure airport. A safe overweight landing was accomplished and maintenance was requested.

Push; engine start; taxi; and takeoff were uneventful. On climb out; aircraft entered IMC and icing conditions; and Captain turned on engine anti-ice. At approximately 16;000 ft. MSL; Crew observed 'IAS DISAGREE' and 'ALT DISAGREE' on the Primary Flight Displays; followed very shortly by Master Caution; ENG caution indicator; and both EEC 'ALTN' lights illuminated. Crew noted the Captain's airspeed to be significantly lower than the First Officer's and standby airspeed; so Captain transferred aircraft control to First Officer.Crew completed the Airspeed Unreliable memory items; and then coordinated with ATC to level at FL190 and maintain current heading to continue troubleshooting. After leveling off; Captain's airspeed showed approximately 100 knots below First Officer's and standby airspeed. Captain's altimeter showed approximately 300 ft. higher than First Officer's and standby altimeter. Crew ran the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist from the Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook; up to deferred items; and requested priority handling with ATC. Crew determined the First Officer's airspeed and altitude were reliable; so in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook; the First Officer re-engaged Flight Director and autopilot.After determining ZZZ3 as a suitable divert field; Crew informed ATC and Dispatch of intention to divert; and then informed Flight Attendants and Passengers of the situation. Crew then ran the EEC Alternate Mode Checklist from the Quick Reference Handbook; placing both engines in hard alternate mode. Crew also completed the diversion checklist and the deferred items from the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist. On arrival; below approximately 10;000 ft. and in VMC; Crew observed Captain's airspeed and altitude to be indicating correctly. First Officer flew an uneventful visual approach to Runway XXL and overweight landing at ZZZ3 (LGW 131;000 pounds). Taxi in to Gate X and shutdown were uneventful.,B737-700 pilot reported Captain's air speed and altitude information became erroneous in flight with icing conditions present. The flight crew switched to First Officer's instruments and performed a diversion and a precautionary landing.

The Captain was the Flying Pilot. When he returned from the second break it; was noted that the left engine oil quantity had been dropping. The left engine oil quantity had dropped from 7 to 3 in the matter of about 30 minutes. The oil pressure and temperature was remaining consistent at 196 psi and 110 degrees. Since there is not a procedure for low quantity; the Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to advise of the situation. See if they could see and monitor engine parameters and to discuss then next step if the quantity did in fact reach zero. He advised to monitor. The Crew discussed possible diversion airports and weather. The FM and QRH were referenced for the appropriate checklist and procedures if the engine oil parameters deteriorated. The left engine oil quantity did in fact reach zero and I began keeping track of the engine parameters for trends. The engine went to zero quantity at XA:27. The engine oil pressure and temperature remained consistent for 25 minutes. At this point we had left the tracks; in radar contact with ZZZZ and been given clearance for ZZZZZ direct ZZZ. Once the oil pressure began to drop and it became apparent it was not a quantity sensor issue the Flight Attendant was called to provide a restroom break; be given a heads up briefing and asked to wake the Pilot Monitoring First Officer.While waiting for the third Pilot to return to the flight deck; Dispatch and Maintenance were consulted. During this communication; the engine oil pressure light began to flicker. Within minutes; the oil pressure was boxed and red on the engine indicators. Knowing that the QRH for L Eng oil pressure led to an inflight shutdown; the Captain discussed diversion with Dispatch. The third Pilot returned to the flight deck. He began the QRH procedures. I advised the lead Flight Attendant of the situation and provided the briefing items. I then made an announcement to the people. Once we were vectored to ZZZZ1 I provided the Flight Attendants and the passengers and updated time of landing. Also advised passengers why the lights went out momentarily during the transfer of power to the app. The QRH and landing distance computations were completed. A flaps 20 ILS was planned for ZZZZ1. Emergency equipment were in place and standing by. The weather was VFR clouds and visibility. Winds favored the runway but were gusty. Approximately 260 at 24 gusting 35. Appropriate adjustments were made to VREF.Landing was in the touchdown zone. Rollout and stop were as expected with the single thrust reverser and wind gust. The aircraft completed a 180 at the end of the runway and exited at taxiway Alpha. Emergency equipment followed and inspected the aircraft. Once entering the temp area the left truck break temperature had risen. The aircraft was stopped. The Fire Chief advised they saw fire. They sprayed and extinguished the fire. The Brake Temperature Monitoring System (BTMS) Checklist was completed and 1 hour was needed before moving aircraft again. I advised the Flight Attendant and passengers. The Flight Attendants decided to use that hour to serve the passengers breakfast. I communicated with Operations on plan for the passengers and aircraft.Once time was complete. The Aircraft was towed to the gate and met by Mechanics and Ground Security Coordinator.,B767 flight crew reported they shut down one engine due to loss of oil pressure; diverted to the nearest airport; and after landing with one engine; the rear brakes caught fire which was extinguished by airport personnel.

It was determined to be the outer layer of the window. We immediately leveled off; and asked ATC for a return. We ran the appropriate Quick Reference Handbook Checklist and Diversion Checklist. Dispatch seemed to immediately know that something wasn't right and we responded to their message confirming an air return. We notified the Flight Attendants first; then the passengers telling them exactly what had happened and why we were returning to Denver.We did not request priority handling but ATC began to refer to us as a critical aircraft so we went with that assuming that they had declared priority handling for us. We made an uneventful smooth overweight landing. There were multiple emergency vehicles lined along the runway as we landed. Logbook entries were made for both the cracked windshield; and the overweight landing specifying the smooth landing and a brakes-on speed of 65 kts. Dispatch and Maintenance Control were called at the gate. Another aircraft had been designated for the continuation of the flight. The First Officer and I determined that we were okay to continue to operate the [next] flight.,B737-700 Captain reported the First Officer's windshield cracked during climb. The flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

Shortly after departure; we were cleared direct ZZZZZ and climb to FL210. About 6000 ft. MSL; the First Officer; Pilot Flying; began adding rudder trim. A few seconds later; the auto-throttles disengaged and the aircraft began to increase yaw. We looked at the number 2 engine instruments and saw N1 gauge about 55 percent and Fuel Flow around 3000 pounds per hour. EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) were normal. We leveled off at 9000 ft. and began to assess the situation. The amber ENG FAIL annunciator appeared on the upper Display Unit. I called for the Engine Failure Checklist in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). I requested priority handling with ZZZ departure and requested radar vectors while we ran checklists. We notified Dispatch; through ZZZ Operations; communicated with the Flight Attendants and notified the passengers that we were returning to ZZZ for a mechanical issue. Landing data was acquired; one engine inoperative flaps 15 landing. Auto Brakes 3 were selected. Once landing data and the Engine Failure Checklist was complete; up to the one Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist; the First Officer transferred the controls to me for the landing. Flaps 15 landing was made uneventful. We stopped the aircraft in order to have ARF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) assess the condition of the aircraft and run brake cooling numbers. We were given the all clear by ARF. Brake cooling allowed us to taxi to the gate. Maintenance met the aircraft and a logbook entry was made. After aircraft was deplaned; I had a conference call with the Chief Pilot on call; Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and Manager.,B737-800 flight crew reported an engine failure in flight. The flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

At the gate at ZZZ we were using the start cart for air conditioning. We switched over to PCA (Preconditioned Air)  because we thought the start cart fumes were getting ingested. Fast forward 3 hours later to the Arrival and we had just crossed ZZZZZ. We were cleared out of 12000 ft.; power came back at we got very strong fumes. FO (First Officer) suggested we go on oxygen and [request priority handling]. FO became the Pilot Flying and I coordinated with the FAs (flight attendants) and Operations. FO coordinated with ATC. We declined XXR due to last minutes changes and we had our mask on. We landed; [were given] the all clear and we taxied to the gate.Found out that the APU that was on a placard had lots of contamination that was injested into the compressor and into the plane. The engines at idle with the hp bleed opening was believed to be the causeMore checks possibly needed when an APU goes out of service.,A319 flight crew reported a fume event during destination descent.

Climbing through 10;000 feet MSL cleared by ATC to maintain 270 Knots. Continued as planned on course to ZZZ. After climbing through FL 180 notified Purser not to commence inflight service. Leveled off at FL330. Completed non normal unannunciated checklist procedure for tire pressure -tire fail checklist. Then ZZZZZ Dispatch approaching ZZZ; discussed options; continue or ZZZ1. At this point brought Purser into the loop and I made the decision to ZZZ1. Purser returned to cabin to brief crew and run precautionary landing check list I made a preparatory brief to passengers. ZZZZZ Dispatch to confirm plan to ZZZ1. Dispatch calculated our fuel dump and return fuel for landing. Notified ATC of our intentions to dump fuel and request priority handling and return to ZZZ1. ATC turned us south and away from weather. At XB:22Z we began to dump 65;500 pounds of fuel; IAH 090/80nm FL330. Fuel dump time 27 minutes. ATC gave us a turn to the west and descent to FL300. Fuel dump complete XB:50Z FL300 100nm southeast of ZZZ. Confirmed priority with ATC XB:55Z. Center cleared us direct ZZZ1. Descent arrival and approach to Runway 36R normal planned landing with 30 flaps no auto brakes as per checklist to land below max landing weight. Slight yaw to left as main landing gear contact the runway as expected with a flat tire; stopped on runway; inspected by ZZZ1 ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting); confirmed wheel six tire flat no other complicating issues in progress; then cleared the runway. ZZZ1 ARFF remained with the aircraft until we were towed to gate. In congruence with ZZZ1 ARFF terminated priority handling with ZZZ1 Tower at XD:35Z.We were reluctant to dump the fuel and actually considered in the ZZZZZ three way with Dispatch and maintenance to continue on to MAD. However; when including Purser into the loop; who has actually first hand knowledge with vision of the physical condition of the passengers we were carrying- first thing Purser asked? No problem with this aircraft getting into alternate for a medical divert? Our ALTNs were OK but not great. Decision was made there to ZZZ1. Then later in this event as we were just about to terminate the fuel dump. Received a message from maintenance to Dispatch to us that 'Company aircraft maintain real time computer shows tires pressures fine just bad aircraft sensor all good you can relax. Bad info. And last of great concern; brought to my attention by Purser; our flight was knowing Dispatched without a FA language speaker. Very interesting flight; great crew; time permitting; I really feel its important to bring Purser into the loop onto flight deck if the situations time constraints allow.""",B777 flight crew reported a tire pressure EICAS message on takeoff. The flight crew elected to request priority handling and dump fuel. An air turn back and precautionary landing were them performed.

Flaps ceased to move beyond flaps 10 degrees. We elected to go around and requested vectors to run the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) and opted not to accept holding instructions due to the fact that the autopilot would not engage. Ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree and continued to be vectored southwest of the field until ready for approach on the long Runway (XX). Captain elected to [request priority handling] and I agreed. Insufficient time to notify Dispatch.  very busy right seat due to no autopilot. Captain flew the aircraft and got the radios. Non-normal performance data was loaded and we continued the approach following QRH guidelines. There was some discussion about the speeds; but in the end it was agreed that the speeds were correct. Flaps were extended to 15 using alternate flap extension procedure. QRH finished to completion prior to landing. I notified Flight Attendants of the malfunction and Passengers subsequently as well during the vectoring. Flight Attendants were very professional and informative. Asked Tower to roll the trucks just in case. Landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway and had trucks conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. After that; and brake cooling calculation; we decided it was safe to taxi to the gate. Passengers and In-flight Crew were very positive after opening the cockpit door. I think I heard applause from the back during landing roll-out.After speaking with the Captain one day after this event; he said he had called the Company to discuss further in depth regarding the failure.  At the time of the event it was impossible to ascertain what caused the flaps to cease normal operation.  Captain subsequently described his conversation with Maintenance and explained that they stated two of the flap transmissions had seized. This in turn prevented autopilot engagement.  Perhaps that is why we always hand fly no flap or reduced flap approaches during training?  I am not sure how we could have prevented the flaps from seizing. It's becoming clear to me that the fleet is aging as more and more mechanical issues crop up.""",B737 Flight crew reported trailing edge flap failure during approach.

In the carry forward items section of the release there was a long time fault with the #1 EEC. Then in the log history on Day 0 the aircraft had a leading edge flaps transit light stays on write up. There were a series of write ups with the flaps in the history saying #2 transit light on. The first one starting on Day 0; then Day 1 was the second occurrence; then Day 2; then on our flight on Day 3. All of these write ups had the leading edge flaps transit light on. We did discuss this history together before the flight.Normal flight up until top of descent point. Thunderstorms were starting to pop up into central [state] and there was holding into one of the airports; we think it was ZZZ1. Frequency was very saturated and difficult to get any word with ZZZ2 center or Center. We asked for lower 4 times on frequency before given our first descent and that this point we were 5000+ feet high on the arrival. When finally given descent via ZZZZZ1 landing east we told ATC we would be do are best but were already very high. Speeds on the arrival were complied with and full speed brakes were used from the TOD which was my best guess FL350 down to a cleared to bottom of 6;000 feet. When we switched to approach we were vectored off the arrival for traffic and told to maintain 6;000 feet. Approach gave us a vector off the arrival and then vectored us on ILS approach course. Thunder storms were building all around ZZZ and there were some buildups and rain that we went through when being vectored and re-vectored onto the arrival. At some point during these vectors back onto the ILS Runway XXL approach course we were given a speed reduction to 210 knots. This occurred somewhere on the base leg to final. At that time the Captain called for flaps 1. All indications with the Flap position indicator showed flaps 1; the handle was at flaps 1; but the LE Flaps transit light was still illuminated. A quick glance up at the Leading Edge Devices annunciator panel showed 1 amber light; the rest were green. The amber light was located on the left hand side underneath the flaps 1 number at the top of the annunciator. We were concerned with the approaching thunderstorms to the ZZZ airport so I pulled out the paper Quick Reference Handbook and we began running through the procedure while continuing on the approach. Went to the flight controls tab; then the leading edge flaps transit light page read the notes out loud quickly and then read through point 1 where it gives you the option to choose 1. We read through the first one and ruled it out and had a quick discussion that were was no roll or any indication of any asymmetry. Read the second one and again after some quick discussion agreed it was our problem. Went to step 7 and started to plan for a flaps 15 landing. We set Vref 15 +15 knots. This is where I made an initial error. I selected flaps 15 Vref speed and then put +15 in the wind additive so I think the flaps 15 speed was 160 and I put the plus 15 in the wind additive for a speed of 165 knots initially. Then step 9 is use normal wind additive winds were like 150@9 at the time so would of been + 5 but I did not change anything at this point. Step 10 is to put the ground proximity flap inhibit switch to inhibit so I confirmed that with the Captain and did that. Somewhere right in here we got are last turn on to the approach course and were cleared for the approach. The next step was to calculate landing distance so I had to go to my IPAD this the tables are removed in the Quick Reference Handbook for that. Hit they hyperlinks for the 900ER and found the table and read out the landing distance first for the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry Flap lever 15 and then I realized this was not the right table and found the Leading edge flaps transit flaps 15 aircraft condition. We were approximately 145;000 pounds so I read out 5;000 feet needed for good braking and 7;000 for medium. I then looked at the adjustments to landing distance and the only one that applied was the add per C above ISA and it was minimal. Then went to step 3 for the 15% safety margin and if it went down to medium braking we needing about 8;200 feet of runway and less than 6;000 feet for good. The rain was not hitting the airport currently so we expected to have 600 braking. The runway is listed as 9;000 feet long on the 10-9 and 8;400 ft. available beyond the threshold. I did all this as fast as I could and while we were intercepting the glide slope and starting down on the approach. All through this the center and approach frequencies were completely saturated with constant communication from ATC to other aircraft and us with no real significant breaks between radio transmissions. I read aloud steps 13 and 14 and then went right into the deferred items because we were at that point already. Captain called for gear and flaps 15 somewhere in the middle of the deferred items checklist we finished the checklist somewhere between 1;500 feet and 1;000 feet. Captain asked if we were good and we both agreed we were to continue the approach. I double checked the whole procedure reading it quickly through again and realized I set the flaps 15 speed wrong so by the I think Vref 15 was 149 I added the 15 knots to 164 and put that in on the speed line and then changed the wind additive to +5 so we had an approach speed of 169. I did this right before we were at 1;000 feet. At some point during all of that we were switched over to Tower and cleared to land. There was a corporate jet on the runway and he was being told told we were fast approaching and to vacate the runway. Then given expedite instructions and then a little above 500 feet. tower issued go around instructions to us.We were given a heading slightly off from runway heading an initial climb to 2;000 feet Captain gave all the correct go around commands we went to heading select and flew the Tower assigned heading; we had a discussion of the missed approach instructions because Captain wanted to make sure he heard them correctly and also a discussion about going all the way to clean maneuvering speed or leaving flaps down. Captain wanted to try and recycle the flaps to see if we got the light again. So we did go all the way to flaps up and after takeoff. Eventually Tower gave us a turn to the downwind and a climb to 4;000 feet and switched us back over to approach. Approach re-vectored us on to the course for another ILS XXL approach. Captain redid an abbreviated approach brief and then we selected flaps 1 again and go the LE Flaps transit light. We went through the Quick Reference Handbook again and completed all the steps to the deferred item landing checklist. We completed the deferred item checklist after the gear was selected down and that finished the procedure. While being vectored I did let approach know that we were going to have a final approach speed of 170 knots we never [requested priority handling] or let any outside source know of the flap system malfunction. Our main concern was getting into the field before the thunderstorms passed over it. Captain made an uneventful flaps 15 landing. We exited at [taxiway] 1 and were told to go straight to ramp and ramp told us to go into [the gate]. We complied with instructions and safely parked. Completed the parking checklist and then called ops to let them know of the maintenance problem and Captain put the write up into the ELB.,B737 First Officer reported operating an aircraft with a long history of leading edge flap asymmetry discrepancies. This aircraft had a repeat discrepancy occur during approach to landing. The flight crew performed a go around and complied with the QRH procedures and rejoined the approach and landing at destination airport.

At around 35;000 ft on climb out; and prior to cruise; the FO (First Officer) asked if he could go back to the lavatory. I called back to the a FA and got his restroom break set up. While waiting for the 'ok to come out' callback from the a FA; the FO vomited all over the center control pedestal and my right side. After a few seconds to realize what had just happened; I made sure the aircraft was still operating normally (Autopilot B and a VNAV level off to cruise at 37;000 ft). The FO was obviously terribly embarrassed; but he was able to act as my Pilot Monitoring for the rest of the flight. He was not incapacitated; but I instructed him that I would take over as Pilot Flying. I wanted him to just be a very thorough PM (pilot monitoring) for the rest of the flight to back me up with my additional tasks.I then called the A FA again to let them know what had happened; and that we would need some additional galley supplies for an attempted clean up. While attempting to use the intercom; we realized that the entire communications system (VHF 1; VHF 2; intercom; both CA (Captain) and FOs Audio Control panels; headsets; and hand mics) was either failed or working incorrectly. One of the radio transmitters developed an intermittent stuck mike; yet none of the microphone transmit keys anywhere in the cockpit were being pressed. We were unable to transmit on either VHF 1 or 2; but could intermittently receive and transmit on ATIS on VHF 2. We attempted every possible transmitter/receiver combination we could think of; calls in the blind; etc. While I was doing that; the FO was in the Quick Reference Handbook reviewing to see if anything was directly applicable in the Communications or General sections. Since this was not working; I decided to use my authority to ensure a safe outcome. I set the transponder; and sent Dispatch an ACARS briefly explaining what was going on. I asked them for priority on our behalf; and advised we would continue to ZZZ via the filed route and fly the RNAV RNP M with our ETA. Amidst all this going on; the FO mentioned trying to put the Audio Control Panel into Alternate Mode (which forces VHF 1 to the CA side only; disables interphone; etc). When I put the CAs ACP (Audio Control Panel) into Alternate Mode; I was able to regain intermittent transmit ability on VHF 1. We then contacted Center; explained what was going on; and advised them of our plan in the event we lost communications further along in the flight. I then called the flight attendants; explained what was going on; and did a test briefing at the end to make sure we were all on the same page. I then made 2 PAs to the cabin. The first was the standard 'prior to descent/goodbye PA'; the second a few minutes later was an explanation that they could possibly see some priority vehicles near the aircraft on arrival. I simply explained that we had a radio malfunction; but the aircraft was safe and that we would be landing shortly. The FO and I then completed all the normal approach checklists and procedures. The descent; approach; and landing were routine and safe. Since VHF 1 was working intermittently; I was able to get a handoff from Center to ZZZ Tower. I told Tower we would be unable to make any of the ZZZ Channel Traffic calls; so he asked another plane to do it for us and kept the GA traffic off the final approach course for Runway 8. We arrived at the gate; and the FO was met by ZZZ paramedics for evaluation. I spoke with the ZZZ gate agents; and then wrote up the inoperative equipment in the logbook for ZZZ maintenance. I then called Dispatch; the FODO (Flight Operations Duty Officer); and completed this required report.,B737-700 flight crew reported communication equipment problems following pilot illness incident.

We ran all QRH procedures and checklists and landed uneventfully in ZZZ.There wasn't anything we (the Crew) could've done to prevent this event. But; I was told numerous times yesterday that this event is happening 4-5 times a month.  Can you please tell me WHY this is happening?  This is potentially a very dangerous situation.  Why is it happening so frequently?,B737 flight crew reported the Captain's forward windscreen delaminated and shattered. The flight crew performed a diversion to uneventful landing.

We coordinated with Tower for go-around instructions and went around. After performing the go-around and switching to departure we conducted the non-normal per SOP and entered a hold over ZZZZZ. We advised departure of our nose wheel steering fault and coordinated with them to have a tug relocate to the runway. ATC requested priority handling on our behalf and crash and fire rescue also met us after landing. We sent an ACARS to Dispatch; made multiple PAs for the passengers and advised inflight. ATC vectored us back in line for a second approach. We advised the Tower once again of our issue and; after landing; we cleared on FR and stopped clear of Runway XXL. Crash and fire rescue evaluated the aircraft and found no issues. Once the tug was hooked up we were towed to gate. After block in we entered the discrepancy into the logbook and called Dispatch to clarify the event with them.,A321 pilot reported a WHEEL N/W STEERING message on gear extension. The flight crew elected to perform a go-around and complied with the Quick Reference Procedures.

The vibration continued and at about 8;000 feet; I mentioned it to the FO (First Officer). Both of us have less than 400 hours in the Airbus fleet; and at that point; I was thinking it might still be something normal for an A319; though it was clear by then it wasn't turbulence-driven. We accelerated after 10;000 feet to 320 knots and the vibrations got slightly more noticeable. The FO pulled out his QRH and showed me the checklist for unusual vibrations. I slowed the aircraft to about 305 knots and elected to transfer aircraft control to the FO so that I could run the checklist. Upon attempting to diagnose the problem; it seemed that the vibrations were intermittent and not fully dependent on airspeed. The number 1 engine N1 vibration on first look was .9; which I felt was a bit high; but vibrations continued later with vibration indications all below .5; and the vibrations did not vary with thrust. The airframe vibration checklist is not a true checklist but appears to be a bunch of bullets for crew awareness. It explicitly states that aircraft vibrations due to flight controls 'do not represent handling or performance concerns.' The vibrations initially resembled the symptoms listed in the QRH as flight control vibrations; so we continued our climb. At 14;000 feet the Number 2 Flight Attendant called from the aft galley; to notify me of significant aircraft vibrations; unlike anything she had ever felt. I told her that the vibrations were a known problem in the Airbus fleet. I viewed her report as confirming the verbiage in the QRH; so we continued. But she also indicated that she only flew Airbus trips and her seniority number indicated over XX years as a Flight Attendant (FA); and she was insistent that she had never experienced these vibrations before. So at the least; that information suggested an atypical problem. I called the Number 1 FA to ask what she was experiencing. She said that she felt some minor vibrations but nothing that concerned her. She also suggested the Number 2 FA had a flair for drama; in so many words. We continued the climb; but I asked the FO to slow us a little more to 290; while we considered the QRH guidance. The way the QRH is written; it suggests troubleshooting the problem; which seems to conflict with the FOM section concerning troubleshooting. Upon discussion; we elected to put in 1.5 units of rudder trim for a short while to try to alleviate the vibrations; which appeared effective.Throughout the climb; the vibrations continued intermittently with varying intensity. At about 30;000 feet; the FO and I decided that the vibrations were not fitting any one specific problem listed in the QRH. I still didn't have enough information to decide upon whether to continue the flight; but I reasoned that the lower dynamic pressure at a higher altitude would be as safe or safer; while we continued to try to diagnose the problem. I had the FO slow to 260 KIAS while I prepared to call Dispatch to see if I could reach an Airbus specialist. I was interrupted by the Number 2 who called to repeat her concerns to me; before I could complete the call. I explained to her again that what she was experiencing was described in our checklist and that I could only go by the checklist. At this point; though; I still wasn't sure which specific problem we had. We were experiencing 'characteristics' that were listed under both elevator and rudder vibrations. On crew-phone; the Dispatcher was able to connect me to an Airbus maintenance specialist. By now; we had leveled off at a cruise altitude of 34;000 feet. I described the symptoms to him; and he didn't seem to understand any better than us what we were experiencing. I mentioned that the elevator vibe was supposed to appear above 280 knots; the rudder vibe was supposed to appear above 260 knots; and by this point; we were .77 Mach and 255knots and still experiencing the vibrations intermittently. The maintenance technician had no explanation and as ZZZ1 was 45 miles off the nose; I told the maintenance tech and the Dispatcher that we were diverting to ZZZ1. They both concurred; and I broke down the phone patch.The FO had heard me when I said we were diverting and concurred. I asked him to get a clearance to divert to ZZZ1 and to set the cockpit up for our arrival. We decided to keep the speed back at 250 KIAS for the descent; and I instructed the FO to not use speed brakes as a precaution; as we had decided we had a malfunction of unknown origin. The FO mentioned that we would be overweight by a few thousand pounds so I told him to [receive priority] and request ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) meet us after landing. ATC vectored us to manage our altitude loss. I discontinued the Airframe Vibration analysis and ran the Non-Routine Landing Considerations OD checklist as a Precautionary landing. After talking to the flight attendants and the passengers; I briefed the arrival and approach to the FO. Then I assumed pilot flying duties while the FO completed normal procedures checklists. ATC had offered an RNAV to [Runway] XXC; but I requested an ILS to XXR as I wanted to have the best possible indication of any pitch variations. I configured the aircraft and slowed early so we would have some altitude in case any controllability issues occurred in the landing configuration. I elected to land flaps full if things were normal up to CONF 3 as we were only a few thousand pounds above max landing weight; and we had plenty of go-around thrust. The aircraft handled fine; so we dropped flaps to full; though the FO and I agreed that there seemed to be slightly abnormal vibrations all the way to landing.Touchdown and landing rollout were normal. We asked the tower and fire chief if they saw anything unusual as we were ending the rollout. They said no; so I elected to taxi clear. I made a PA to the passengers reminding them that the emergency vehicles that we were expecting would be visible and that they would follow us as we taxied to the gate. I realize now in writing this account that I forgot to put the overweight landing in the logbook. I was also reminded by another pilot that the Airbus has an overweight landing checklist that we forgot to run; although the FO and I accomplished everything on the checklist in considering the overweight landing.That would depend upon what Maintenance discovers about this problem.There is some confusion in the way the relevant section in the QRH is written; and the direction in the QRH to troubleshoot the problem; which appears in various malfunctions; should be reconciled with FOM section which directs not to troubleshoot. Also; the Airframe Vibration checklist has zero guidance; if air frame vibrations don't fall into any of the listed categories. Obviously; there are too many possible causes of unusual vibrations to list them all; but some direction as to if/when to land based upon some generic criteria like vibe intensity; etc.; would have been nice. Additionally; we are trained in the school; over and over again to run V1 cuts; and we never or rarely run an overweight landing checklist. A simple bullet in the Non-Routine Landing Checklist suggesting to run the overweight landing checklist; time/conditions permitting; would have been helpful to us.,Pilot reported aircraft making unusual vibrations which led to a diversion to another airport.

The message cleared; came back; and cleared again. We requested and were cleared direct ZZZZ which was the closest airport. Upon contact with ZZZ Center; we requested priority. I spoke with dispatch and maintenance control regarding the indication. I briefed inflight of the situation and that it was a code yellow. We landed at ZZZZ; stopped on the runway; and ARFF inspected the fuselage with infrared. We communicated to the customers to remain seated while the ARFF conducted their inspection. We were cleared to taxi to the gate and deplaned normally. ECAM messages entered into logbook.,A320 Pilot reported ECAM warning for forward and aft cargo smoke.

We were flying a 737-700; which has a flaps 30 speed of 165 kts. We were told to maintain 180 kts. to FAF; which occurred at about 1;500 ft. AGL. We therefore had approximately 500 ft. to slow the aircraft and select flaps 30 to meet stabilized approach criteria.The Pilot Flying (PF) requested gear down and flaps 15 approaching glide slope intercept. As I was doing OE; my focus was on watching the FO slow down to 165 kts. so we could select flap 30. I did not notice that when selected to 15; the flaps had stopped at about 8 degrees. When the FO requested flaps 30 and landing check; I ran the checklist and saw that the flaps were not at 30. By this time we were at 1;100 ft. AGL. I instructed the FO to initiate a missed approach and informed Tower that we were going around due to a system malfunction. The missed approach was well flown by the FO; and I felt comfortable having him continue to fly while I worked the problem; and I set the speed at 200 kts.; so not to over speed or stress the flaps. I called back and told the Flight Attendants that we had a malfunction and would need a few minutes before returning to land and that I would call back when I had time and brief them more comprehensively. I made a PA to the passengers that we had an abnormal indication and we would return to land as soon as we had finished our checklists; and that there was no reason to be concerned. I then sent an ACARS message to dispatch alerting them that were would request priority handling due to a flap issue.We completed the QRH procedures; then requested priority handling with ATC; as we would be landing in a non-normal configuration. I called back to the Flight Attendants and briefed them using the TEST method and informed them that we would land normally and that they could expect a normal taxi to the gate. We followed the QRH and selected flaps 15 using the ALTN system; and landed normally. We informed ATC on the ground that we did not require further assistance; but a truck followed us to the gate per their protocol.At the gate we met with maintenance personnel and spoke with the Chief Pilot.We both felt comfortable and able to continue with our scheduled flying; so we did.,737-700 Captain reported a trailing edge flap problem resulted in a go around to perform the QRH procedures. The flight crew then requested priority handling and continued the approach at destination airport.

C/W QRH LE FLAP TRANSIT checklist except that I inadvertently transitioned to the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree checklist via hyperlink. This subsequently resulted in an approach and landing at Vref 40 + 55. The correct configuration and speed should have been Vref 15 + 15. [We advised ATC] and we made an approach and landing without further issue.After the initial missed approach to assess our conditions; ATC issued many altitude; airspeed and heading instructions which distracted and slowed our checklist progress. In fact we reminded ATC we were a [priority] aircraft. [Request priority handling] sooner; perhaps mitigating ATC distraction.,B737-800 flight crew reported Leading Edge device malfunction on approach and used incorrect checklist to address problem.

Nothing; so we accomplished the QRH procedure. Left with no electric stab trim; no Autopilots; and a flaps 15 landing required. After consulting with Dispatch; I decided to return to ZZZ1. While I was very busy with dispatch; ATC; flight attendants; passengers; checking landing distance; and normal checklists; the FO was maintaining aircraft control in a flawless manner; even with many speed and altitude changes on the arrival into ZZZ1. We [requested priority handling] and FO made a great landing on XL at ZZZ1.

I then briefed the FAs about our situation and that we will be doing a normal landing and taxing off the runway for a tow to the gate. I then informed the passengers of a minor system failure that will require us to be towed to the gate after landing. I reassured the passengers and told them we will be met by priority equipment as a precaution. We requested priority handling with Center and asked them to coordinate with approach for Runway XXC.  I sent a message to Dispatch of our landing runway to expedite the tow.

The plane came in the night before; and this write up was cleared. It was the first flight of the day for this airplane. On taxi out; all systems operated normally. We had a delay on the ground for flow into ZZZ. So we had about a 25 minute taxi. Everything was operating normally until we leveled off at FL360; about 30 minutes after takeoff. Shortly after that; we got a ding. Looked over and saw Hydraulic: G RSVR OVHT ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor). Captain divided task by having me fly and do the radios; and he will deal with the ECAM. The ECAM directed us to turn off the PTU (Power Transfer Unit) and Green Hydraulic Pump. We verified each switch before selecting it off. We went over they system pages; and talked about what systems were lost. The CA then went into the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). The QRH had a statement to restore the lost system once it was no longer overheated. Also the QRH noted that we could have a 10% higher burn due to spoiler float. We took the burn to destination then added 10% subtracted that from our FOB. We felt we would still land in ZZZ with plenty of gas. Then the CA notified dispatch; and got a frequency to talk to Maintenance Control. We all agreed that continuing to ZZZ was the best course of action. After about 6 minutes; I noticed the fault had cleared. Since the Green system has landing great extension; nose wheel steering; normal breaking; thrust reverser 1; and 2 spoilers on it; we felt trying to restore the system closer to the airport was the safest option. We were concerned if we restored the system too early; it would overheat again on approach. We advised center of our situation; and requested priority handling.With a little less than an hour left; we started briefing. We started talking about all the threats we would have if the system was not restored. We talked about gravity extension; longer landing distance; not being able to steer off the runway. We talked about if we had to go around; we would not be able to retract our gear. That meant higher fuel burn coming back to land. We decided on downwind trying to restore the green system would be the best place; because if it did not restore we would have plenty of time to notify ATC we will be needing a tug and perform the gravity gear extension procedure. We decided to Configure early if the system restored In case it would over heat again. Talked about if the system over headed again on final approach after configuring; what we would do. We had two jump seaters; and we asked them if they had any other suggestions or they agreed with our plan of action. They agreed with our plan; and provided some concerns to keep in mind. We told ATC we will need XXL for landing; because it was the longest runway. Told ATC we will need ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) standing by; and notified them of potentially needing to be towed off the runway. After we were done briefing; the CA took over flying the airplane. When abeam the field; we were able to restore the Green system. Made a normal approach and landing. We are able to taxi off the runway and to the gate on our own power. Maintenance met us at the gate; and we told them of the issues. They informed us that this has been a reoccurring issue over the past several days. Great teamwork; workload management; and communication lead this event to be a successful outcome.,A320 flight crew reported a Green Hydraulic System Reservoir Overheat light illuminated in flight. The flight crew performed the QRH procedures and secured the Green system Pump. The flight crew requested priority handling and reactivated the Green System Pump closer to the destination airport to conduct a precautionary landing.

We [requested priority handling]. ATC vectored us around airspace for another approach. Ran the after takeoff checklist. Then the Quick Reference Handbook for flap disagreement. Flaps came up. Flaps reset and we continued with a normal successful landing.,B737 NG flight crew reported a flap malfunction while on approach. The pilots executed a missed approach; ask for priority handling and completed the QRH procedures. The pilots reported they successfully setup and completed another approach and landing.

We ran and completed the ECAM; [requested priority handling]; Diverted to ZZZ1; relayed to Dispatch our situation and plans; and briefed the flight attendants. We followed up with the notes and cautions in the FMS for Green Reservoir Overheat; had Dispatch compute landing data with penalties per our selected runway. The approach procedures in the notes and caution section directs the green hydraulic pump on if hydraulic reservoir overheat indication is gone. In our case; it was gone. On final we turned on the green pump and had a normal landing. We exited the runway and stopped. We then requested and were towed to the gate.,A320 First Officer reported a hydraulic system overheat during cruise. The flight crew diverted to a nearby airport and made a precautionary landing.

We executed a missed approach and brought the flaps up during the go around. We ran the Quick Reference Handbook while flaps were up; following the option that stated; Trailing edge flaps are up. We configured for a second approach and the light illuminated once again when we selected flaps to 10. We broke off from the approach and left the flaps at 10. We ran the Quick Reference Handbook again; this time following the Trailing edge flaps are extended and the trailing edge flap position indication agrees with the flap handle position option. This option leads to a flaps 15 landing and at this point we requested priority handling. We executed an approach and landing with flaps at 15 and had Crash Fire Rescue measure brake temps upon landing. Once we received the all clear from Crash Fire Rescue we contacted dispatch and maintenance control who told us to continue to the gate. ELB entries were made upon reaching the gate.,Flight Crew reported a go around was caused by a Leading Edge Flaps Transit Light remained illuminated after flaps were fully configured on approach. The Flight Crew ran the Quick Reference Handbook procedures; then requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at destination airport.

FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying); I was PM (Pilot Monitoring). Encountered moderate turbulence climbing through approximately FL 190. I called FA (Flight Attendants) to have them remain seated for a while longer. I observed that we now in icing conditions (had entered cloud with OAT of 5 Degrees C.); so I turned on Engine Anti Ice. Approximately 15 seconds later while climbing through FL 220; #1 Engine had substantial loss of thrust with loud noise and vibration. Aircraft yawed sharply left. FO was still hand flying at this point. He immediately announced 'My Aircraft'; applied right rudder & aileron while reducing aircraft pitch attitude to maintain airspeed. I instructed him to level off and regain control of aircraft. Notified ATC that we wanted to stop the climb and descend back to FL 210. Then turned attention back to #1 Engine. Was producing about 35-40% N1 while still making noise and vibrating. FO disconnected Auto throttles and retarded #1 thrust lever to idle. Noise and vibration stopped with engine still running at flight idle. #1 FA called to ask if we had heard the noise. I told him that we had an engine problem; that the aircraft was under control; and that I would get back to them as soon as I could. I [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors back to ZZZ. ATC began vectors with an initial right hand turn to the southwest; followed by a turn to the west. I told controller we would need a decent sized box pattern back to ZZZ to accomplish checklists. Received ATC clearance back to ZZZ via radar vectors. FO suggested descent to exit icing conditions. I made the request with ATC and we descended back into clear air at 17;000 feet; where FO trimmed the aircraft for single-engine cruise. I suggested an attempt to see if the engine would now produce any more power. As the FO began to advance the #1 thrust lever; the noise and vibration returned without any increase in thrust. After discussing the situation with the FO; I made the decision to secure the engine. I used the QRH to accomplish engine severe damage or separation; one engine inoperative landing; and non-routine landing Checklists. This included briefing the flight attendants for a precautionary landing; making 2 PAs to the passengers; and notifying Dispatch via the Crew Phone. Received radar vectors for ILS to Runway XX in VMC. Confirmed with ATC that ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) would be standing by.FO was still PF while I also made all necessary modifications to the FMC; including route change and setting up for the approach. Completed normal Descent checklist and Before Landing checklist to the line. Once established on final approach; I assumed control of the aircraft and became the PF to accomplish the landing. I made this decision because I had much more experience in the 737 (new CA with just 130 hours but flew it for 2 years an FO with about 1400 hours). The new hire FO had just recently completed his OE and had just over 40 hours in the 737. We had identified the low-time status for each of us as a threat in our earlier briefing at the gate. Configured for single-engine landing and completed Before Landing checklist. Performed single-engine landing on Runway XX at ZZZ. Stopped aircraft on the runway at approximately the mid-field position (near taxiway F). Made a quick PA instructing passengers to remain seated as Safety vehicles completed an inspection. ATC assigned discreet frequency for us to communicate with ARFF Commander. Had ARFF conduct visual inspection of the aircraft. Received the 'all clear' and then taxied to gate with ARFF following us. Upon arriving at gate; made a final PA to passengers advising them that the aircraft would be going out of service and to take all belongings as they exited; and that a gate agent would have more information concerning the flight as a new plan was put together. Gate agent came on board and informed me thatthey had a new aircraft and gate. I informed passengers of the new gate with a final PA. Made an AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) entry for the engine failure and discussed with Maintenance Supervisor; who had also come on board. I want to commend the performance of the New Hire FO. He did an outstanding job of maintaining aircraft control and communicating with ATC when I was otherwise busy talking to other involved parties. While new to airline with just over 40 hours in the 737; his previous experience as a different make/model pilot proved invaluable. I think we worked together very well by implementing the company strategy and communicating effectively. It proves that 2 pilots who were flying just our 2nd leg together can 'gel' and successfully work through a serious situation.,B737 Captain reported loss of thrust and engine vibration after selecting Engine Anti Ice to on. The Flight Crew performed an inflight shut down of the affected engine and made an air turn back and precautionary landing at destination airport.

After seeing no indications of flight control malfunction; the autopilot was re-engaged. Soon afterwards; another pitching oscillation occurred that caused the autopilot to disconnect again. This time; however; the ECAM displayed multiple failures; ranging from autopilot disconnect; ELAC 1 and 2 failure; Pitch Trim Fail; and the aircraft degrading to alternate law for the flight controls. After establishing control and affirming that the items were not immediate action or ECAM exceptions; we accomplished the ECAM actions and [requested priority handling] to ATC. We continued to descend and follow the arrival with no major flight control issues. The aircraft landed normally and was met by ZZZ Airport Fire and Rescue Equipment. After landing; we cancelled the [priority handling] and proceeded normally to the gate.,A319 Captain reported an ELAC1 and ELAC2 fail occurred inflight; resulting in pitch oscillation and autopilot disconnect. The flight crew regained controlled and continued to landing at the destination airport.

I started the initial descent from 38;000 feet; shortly after starting the descent the Master Caution Light illuminated with the corresponding 'Auto Fail' Light illuminating on the pressurization panel. At that time I also noticed that the Cruise Altitude and Landing Altitude displays were blanked. I called out the abnormality and the Captain stated that it was 'Your Aircraft'. At that time I verified that I was in control of the aircraft 'My Aircraft' and continued the descent. Continuing the descent I also worked the radios while the captain proceeded to run the 'Auto Fail' light checklist in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). Initially it looked as though the captain was able to control the pressurization but around 22 thousand feet the captain directed me to put on my O2 mask. After donning the O2 masks and establishing crew communications the Captain told me to request priority handling and he then manually deployed the Passengers O2 masks. Once we were below 10;000 feet the Captain directed me to remove my O2 mask at that time we completed all normal checklists and landed safely.During the Auto Fail light checklist I noticed that the 'Auto Fail' light stayed illuminated and the 'ALT' and 'MAN' light never illuminated during the checklist. During the descent a slower rate of descent may have helped with controlling the pressurization of the Aircraft. After Landing maintenance informed us that the aircraft had previous pressurization issues with this aircraft. (9 write ups on Pressurization Problems was mentioned). I believe a slower rate of descent and smaller thrust reductions may have helped with manually controlling the pressurization after the initial pressurization failure. I also believe with multiple write ups on the pressurization system their may have been an issue that maintenance might not have caught.,B737 flight crew reported loss of cabin pressure control during descent and the need for oxygen masks. The flight crew requested priority handling and made an immediate descent and landing at destination airport.

During startup we had an ELAC 1 fault which was cleared with ECAM. I was PF (Pilot Flying) and after takeoff; the aircraft had a heavy vibration and roll action. We continued the climb and cleaned up the aircraft. We had a FA (Flight Attendant) visually confirm that the left spoilers were deployed with the spoiler handle in the down and disarmed position. We continued to climb and the vibration mostly dissipated but was still evident. After confirmation with Maintenance Control and Dispatch on the Crew Phone; we elected to divert and land in ZZZ instead of continuing to destination ZZZ1. We burned down as much fuel as we could and set up for an approach. When we configured to flaps 2 the serious vibrations started again. We preformed a controllability check at pattern altitude and determined that the vibration was too great at flaps full so we used flaps 3 for landing. As we got closer to the Runway; the vibrations dissipated a bit and we made a normal landing overweight by 10;000 pounds into ZZZ. We had ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire) inspect the aircraft for damage; which there was none apparent and taxied to a gate and gave the aircraft to maintenance.  Our inspection of the aircraft at the gate found the right ground spoiler still extended. We are unsure if that was left over from the flight or just the landing roll. The only indications we received during the flight were the green spoiler arrows on ECAM. No other warnings or messages came up. We were and still are perplexed at how any spoilers could have been extended with the handle stowed. There could have been a secondary malfunction with the SEC 3 issue. It caught us totally by surprise. We followed the placard requirements of the SEC which were very basic. Would like to hear from Maintenance on what the cause was.,An A320 Pilot reported left hand spoilers deployed with the spoiler handle in the down position after take off. The flight Crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

We noticed the ENG 2 hydraulic pump LOW PRESSURE light illuminate. The Captain proceeded to perform the Quick Reference Handbook for a Hydraulic Pump LOW PRESSURE (B SYS). After some time; we noticed that the Hydraulic Pressure started to bleed pressure to zero and the ELEC 1 hydraulic pump LOW PRESSURE light illuminated. The Captain then proceeded to perform the loss of hydraulic system B Quick Reference Handbook. The Captain and I saw that hydraulic system A was still operating and was confident that we can make it back to ZZZ2 but also made contingency plans if it did fail enroute. We requested priority handling when we got on with ZZZ2 Center and safely landed in ZZZ2.Lessons learned was to continue to work as a crew and communication between flight crew is critical. The Captain and I went through multiple plans and discussed other possible errors and threats. Training proved to be of extreme help due to the scenarios we went through.,B737-700 First Officer reported loss of B Hydraulic System Fluid Quantity. The flight crew turned off the Hydraulic Pumps and requested priority handling. A precautionary landing was made at destination airport.

The CA called for autopilot engagement. Immediately upon autopilot engagement the aircraft started tracking right of course. The Captain disengaged the autopilot and auto thrust so as to maintain directional control and airspeed as the aircraft seemed to be having difficulty with direction and speed. Tower handed us off to Departure and upon checking in with departure the vibration had dramatically worsened into what I would call more of a severe shake than a vibration so we [advised ATC] and requested a return to the field on the initial check in. Departure gave us vectors for a right hand pattern back to Runway XX. We were assigned an altitude of 5;000 ft. We made it to 5;000 ft. but we had difficulty maintaining altitude. The Captain kept control of the aircraft and had me cycle though the doors; wheels; and flight control pages to try and identify the problem. We found that the flight control page showed the left 3 outboard spoilers were deployed. The FA (Flight Attendant) called twice; first to tell us about the vibration in the back and the second time to tell us that 2 rows of O2 masks had dropped. The Captain made the decision to land flaps 3. We landed on Runway XX and the vibration continued until touchdown. Upon arrival at the gate we found that spoilers on the left had closed however there was a spoiler deployed on the right wing. There was an apparent issue with SEC 3 and it's control of the spoilers as SEC 3 was on an MEL due to the same issue on a previous flight. If there is an issue with a flight control maybe the aircraft should be out of service until the repair is made instead of the MEL.,Air Carrier Captain and First Officer reported that 3 spoilers on the left outer wing deployed during rotation and climb. The pilot crew had difficulty in maintaining aircraft control and returned to the departure airport. The pilots reported a similar event had been recently reported and MEL'ed on this aircraft.

Normally our aircraft would level without any input from me; but we were climbing at a high rate and approaching the aircraft right above us. To avoid a TCAS warning; I attempted to shallow the climb; but the Autopilot was already in capture mode. I reduced the thrust to about 50% to help reduce the climb rate; once we leveled and applied power we got multiple consecutive compressor stalls from the #1 engine. I immediately recognized the stalls and reduced power until it stopped compressor stalling. Several times I tried to add power; but got the same multiple consecutive compressor stalls. While at FL 280; only the #2 engine was used to keep us at cruise. After accessing; we determined to divert to ZZZ1 and [requested priority handling]. Once we got to a lower altitude; the #1 engine operated normally and was not shut down. We did the checklist; I informed the flight attendants and passengers of the situation. We did a normal approach with both engines and an overweight landing. There was no brake cooling issues and taxied to the gate.,B737-700 Captain reported at cruise altitude the #1 engine began multiple consecutive compressor stalls. Engine thrust was reduced; ATC gave the pilots priority handling; a diversion was commenced; and an overweight landing was accomplished.

Tower told him to be advised we were departing the parallel. As the FO (First Officer) rotated and just before calling positive rate call the caravan started a left turn directly into our departure path. At the normal climb rate we were on a course to hit. I gently pushed the nose over to arrest the climb and added a slight right turn to keep us from the caravan. The climb never stopped but was only about 5 to 7 degrees nose up to prevent a midair collision. No audible calls were given from GPWS. After we got to ZZZ1 we called the Tower and talked to the Controller who was on duty during the event. He said the caravan was going to ZZZ2 (it is NE of ZZZ) and was cleared on course. At that time the caravan started a left turn to 190. The Controller had no idea the caravan was going to make a left turn. He apologized for the mishap and no further events came from the flight. Misunderstanding between Tower and the caravans intentions for going to a field that is NE of ZZZ when departing off Runway XXR. When taking off with parallel departures and GA planes taking off wait until they are clear before departure. Keep an eye out for departure paths from GA aircraft.,Flight crew reported a Resolution Advisory on take off from parallel runways. The Captain assumed command and reduced the rate of climb until clear of the other aircraft.

Few seconds after turning off the left PACK; the right PACK light comes on. We were cleared by ATC for FL280; at that moment stopped at FL200 and Request descend and back to ZZZ1.We were cleared direct to ZZZ1 and decent to 10;000 ft. by ATC. We read the check list for right PACK light ;while we were on the check list; Cabin Altitude warning horn activated during descend; CABIN ALT exceeded above 15;000 ft. and passenger oxygen masks deployed. We read the check list for (Cabin altitude or rapid decompression) we use oxygen mask until 10;000 feet. Didn't [request priority handling] because situation was on the control.We didn't see any PACK overheat indication on the ground and before takeoff. Approximately 8 minutes after takeoff we noticed with the first indication which was left BLEED TRIP light followed by right PACK light. Had 45 minutes ground stop in ZZZ2. PACK was running for cooling purposes and cause PACK overheat in flight.We decided to stop climbing at FL200; and run the check list for left BLEED TRIP light. Eventually QRH directed us to shut down the left PACK; immediately after that the right PACK light comes on; at that point we decided to request descend to lower altitude and back to ZZZ1. We definitely need some equipment on the ground to keep the airplane cool during summer especially in hot airports.,Captain reported an immediate descent and air turn back after loss of both packs during climb.

The Captain noticed the same.  We called the Flight Attendants to see if they noticed a strong fuel smell in the cabin. They didn't. We had one of the FA's (Flight Attendants) come to the flight deck to see if we had gotten used to the smell or what they noticed. The Flight Attendant didn't notice anything unusual. We reconfigured packs; cycling to see if the smell would dissipate then we started the other engine and the smell seemed to be gone so we were comfortable departing. We took off during the climb out around 10-11;000 ft.; we noticed a fuel imbalance and the number one main tank was indicating  approximately 1300 lbs. less than the right. The Captain ran the QRH for a fuel leak- it didn't appear that we had an imbalance after running some numbers and not being able to account for a huge drop in fuel. Thinking about the jet fuel smell based back on the ground in ZZZ was the question - that did we have a fuel leak - so [we advised ATC] and we returned to ZZZ. The QRH says to shut down an engine. Given the close proximity to ZZZ; we did not. The rest of the flight was uneventful Fire and rescue didn't notice anything abnormal upon meeting us once we cleared the runway.,Air Carrier flight crew reported a fuel odor during departure taxi which dissipated and returned during initial climb accompanied with a fuel imbalance indication. After troubleshooting the fuel issue the Captain requested priority handling for an immediate air return where the flight landed safely.

I was flying and primarily watching outside with a short scan inside. I can't remember if I called for flaps 1 or 5 first. Regardless; when I thought I had the flaps at 5; I called for the landing gear down and flaps 15 before arriving at the FAF. I then looked at the flap gauge; because the aircraft didn't feel right (felt nose high but we were bouncing around) and noticed the flaps were indicating between UP and 1. We executed a go-around.  We examined the gauge and saw they were split. This was confirmed by the control inputs I was feeling. Captain ran the checklist and coordinated with Flight Attendants and Passengers. I flew and worked ATC. We completed the checklist and proceeded in to Runway XXR. Landing was uneventful. We cleared and held on Taxiway between 8 and 9 where the fire trucks met us. We coordinated for a discreet frequency to talk with them and and asked they keep an eye on the wheels for smoke/fire/abnormalities and also asked them to get a temp reading.  Fire said the brakes were hot but didn't see any smoke or other indications. We re-examined the brake cooking data that we got while on downwind. We discovered an error of using manual braking and no reverses. That was changed to reflect air bulletin X as directed by the landing data and max reverse. The new brake cooling data gave us a 30 minute cool down and allowed for taxi. We slowly taxied and waited for the remaining time before arriving at the gate.,B737-700 flight crew reported an asymmetrical trailing edge indication leading to a go around; then a normal landing.

Flap indications were normal (indicator aligned) during preflight; and flaps deployed normally for takeoff. After takeoff the flaps retracted normally; and there was no adverse or abnormal trim required for flight. The indicator showed a slight split that we saw during cruise. In anticipation of a potential problem; the FO (First Officer; Pilot Monitoring) and I reviewed the flap scenarios from the QRH enroute 'just in case' the flaps didn't extend and were somewhat prepared for this. The WX was good; and we had extra ferry fuel to play with. When ATC wanted us to slow during the arrival phase we were unable. We [advised ATC] and asked for a vector while we ran a checklist. They vectored us downwind to an area and gave us box vectors over the lake. We initially went with the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry checklist; which took us to the Trailing Edge Flaps Up Landing Checklist due to the Lever being UP to match the closest flaps setting. The leading edge devices deployed correctly using the alternative method IAW the checklist. I briefed the FAs as to the situation and the precautionary landing IAW the non-routine landing considerations and briefed the passengers of the situation and that we would be doing a faster than normal landing and that safety vehicles would be present to inspect the brakes due to the speed. We attempted to contact ZZZ ops to no avail; and I was unsure if crew phone would work at 4K'; so I elected to bypass that part. With checklists complete; and a pause to make sure we were both in the loop and comfortable with the scenario thus far; we advised ATC we were ready for the approach to 28C with flaps up; leading edge devices extended. We had also previously requested response vehicles at the runway out of an abundance of caution and to inspect the brakes due to the speed of the landing. We were below max landing weight. Approach was as normal as you can get for the situation; the landing was smooth; and I applied judicious brakes to go along with the reversers. We taxied clear of the runway with several thousand feet remaining. I reminded the pax to remain seated while we had the brakes inspected; then taxied to the gate normally. After deplaning I held the crew for a quick debrief and to let a couple of them decompress. After landing the flaps indicator aligned back normally; however I made sure the write up indicated the split. Aircraft had previous write up for flaps not deploying; which was signed off by maintenance the day prior. The write up did not indicate an asymmetry; or even if the aircraft had been in flight when it occurred. On another note; the FO (PM) did an outstanding job of pacing; monitoring; and working through the processes. The ZZZ personnel were very supportive and present quickly when we got to the gate. I don't think I could set up a more 'like a simulator' scenario if I tried. We had enough of a break to decompress a bit and were fit to continue the day. Maintenance unable to replicate previous condition as it was written in the logbook. Given that everything worked normally until it didn't; I don't think I have preventive measures for this incident. This is why we get trained and paid.,B737 Captain reported conducting a no flap landing after the flaps would not deploy and noted the aircraft was signed off by maintenance for the same issue a day prior to the flight.

Ran the QRH and turned the pump off. Coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance over HF and decide to continue as we had normal pressure and adequate quantity. Just prior to the CP; the reservoir started fluctuating and dropped to 20%. still had 2;950 PSI. over the next 2 hours the quantity fluctuated between 0 and 7%. we discussed the possibility of losing the associated electric pump and the whole A system and looked over the QRH so we were prepared for it on descent into ZZZ1. Both pressures were approximately 2;950 PSI most of the flight. On descent to ZZZ1 we got system B Engine Driven Pump low pressure and ran the QRH again. Turned the pump off and requested priority handling. Requested XXL and notified Dispatch and Flight Attendants. Gear came down slower than normal and flaps as well. We configured normal and landed normal. Brakes worked normal as well as nose wheel steering. System B quantity and pressure seemed to remain normal. Taxied to the gate and Maintenance opened the #1 engine cowl to find hydraulic fluid everywhere. I left before they addressed the #2 engine.,B737 NG flight Crew reported a Hydraulic System A EDP pressure low light on during cruise. The flight crew elected to continue the flight. The A Hydraulic System subsequently lost most system quantity. On descent; The System B EDP also failed. The flight crew requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at the destination airport.

One was indicating fully up while the other was beyond that showing that it was even 'more up' than the limit. Upon further discussion we agreed that it was probably an indication issue as it's impossible for the flaps to be split in that manner. We decided to extend the flaps early on descent in case of any issues with deployment. At around 10;000 MSL I called 'flaps 1'. The Captain moved the flap/slat handle to the 1 position. There was no indication of motion of flaps or LED's. I remained the flying Pilot and took over the radios after we requested priority and requested a Runway (XXC) from Regional Approach at ZZZ. The Captain and I had a brief discussion on which checklist to use. We agreed on flap asymmetry since that was what the indicator was depicting. We were able to get the LED's extended fully and land via the trailing edge flaps up checklist. Upon landing we taxied to the gate normally with Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting following. Worth note is that after landing the trailing edge flap indicator reverted back to normal.I'm not sure what caused the trailing edge flaps to not extend.,B737-800 First Officer reported the trailing edge flap indicator had a split between left and right flap.

I was the flying pilot and called for the QRC for said message. We ran the (767) ENG OVHT - L checklist as appropriate. Once I retarded the thrust lever as indicated in Step 4; the EICAS message extinguished. We continued through the checklist and maintained a thrust setting that maintained the ENG OVHT message not displayed as required. We were in clear skies and a non icing environment.At Step 9 of the checklist; I handed the controls over to FO (First Officer) in order to contact Dispatch and Maintenance Control. We sent them a brief message with the current failure and asked them to contact us via SELCAL. We called the back and had them wake up Relief Pilot who was on their rest break to come back to the FLT Deck. I also spoke with the Purser and advised them of our current engine overheat situation and that we would keep them appraised of the plan. Once on the line with Dispatch and Maintenance Control we collectively discussed the appropriate course of action. We also had them patch in our Chief Pilot for added consultation. As a crew; and after discussion with Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and our Chief Pilot; we determined that the safest course of action was to return to base and not continue across the Atlantic with a possibility of a more serious situation occurring should we continue.We contacted ATC and advised them of the need to return to ZZZ. We [requested priority handling] and due to the fact that we were going to land at max weight with Flaps 20 with a higher approach speed due to this non normal configuration.I again communicated with the Purser to advise her of our decision to return to ZZZ and an estimate of our time to landing. I made a passenger announcement advising them of our current situation and that in the best interest of safety we would be returning to ZZZ assuring them that we would be landing safely within an hour. As a crew; we made a plan and executed it. We had to dump our center tank fuel which was around 10K pounds to assist us in getting below our max landing weight. ATC authorized our fuel dump just north of the ZZZ1 area as we made our way towards ZZZ. We referenced the FOM for this procedure. Upon completion of the fuel dump we still needed to burn additional fuel so ATC gave us vectors on arrival. Again; we made another announcement to the passengers advising them of the personnel that would be following us to the gate in the interest of safety so that they would not be alarmed.We completed all checklists; continued to ZZZ without event; landed under our max landing weight; Flaps 20; with vehicles standing by for safety. After landing we taxied to gate. Our right side brakes entered the caution zone on the taxi in and we relayed this information to the crews for monitoring. After parking and with the aircraft chocked; and brakes not set; our brakes began to cool into the normal range.FO and Relief Pilot did an outstanding job using CRM as a crew throughout the course of this planning; communication; and execution of our return to ZZZ.,B767-400 Captain reported a Left Engine Overheat message at FL310 and returned to departure airport.

After climb out; my Captain reset the bleeds by the checklist. We continued our climb. Around 28;000'; my Captain noticed the cabin altitude was at 10;000' so we leveled off at 28;000'; saw it was still climbing and started a descent after letting ATC know. By the time we got to 27;000; the cabin alt warning went off. We donned our O2 masks and established communication. My Captain started doing all his tasks; and I started a priority descent; being vectored by ATC towards ZZZZ1. Once passing through 10;000' we removed our masks; and continued through all the checklists; and calls to dispatch; and the FA's; etc etc. Once the Captain had caught up with those duties; we turned back inbound on the approach to Runway XX at ZZZZ1; where we performed and overweight landing. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) checked our brakes for temp; and we proceed to the gate. We were familiar with the bleeds off takeoff; having performed it 2 days prior. Upon thinking back afterward; when the Captain did the bleeds reset; he remembered that the bleed pressures did not come back up when reset. I did not see the pressures because I was hand flying at the time. The Captain had also just come off X months of leave and was his first trip back flying. It was also a very long day; 3 legs; previous leg had 2 plane swaps; delaying us; and putting us just a few minutes shy of a max 13 hr duty day. I should have been watching more closely when he changed bleeds and I might have caught it.,B737 Pilot reported a pressurization problem with the aircraft during climb and returned for a precautionary landing.

The aircraft functioned as designed and isolated the failed system allowing the aircraft to continue the flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. There was an Airbus jump seater who is a qualified instructor at the Company who worked with the crew using outstanding CRM principles and ran the checklists and helped back up the coordination with the flight attendants; passengers; ATC; and Dispatch. After discussing the need to burn fuel and landing distance penalties; the final decision to continue to ZZZ1 and we recovered the aircraft uneventfully. We had to stop straight ahead on the runway and get a tug back to the gate. Bottom line; training; good threat and error management; along with outstanding CRM and aircraft operating as designed when a system fails allowed a safe and uneventful day for all.,A320 First Officer reported green system hydraulic failure was mitigated due to proper aircraft isolation and CRM which resulted in safe landing

The level was significantly lower than when we had first leveled off at cruise. We monitored it and reached out to MX (Maintenance) and Dispatch. It kept getting lower until it was right above the low level warning. Decided to divert to ZZZ. During divert descent we noticed it went in the low level range. Upon arrival MX said a screw was loose causing the leak.,A321 First Officer reported loss of fluid from Green Hydraulic System during cruise. At top of descent; the fluid level went into the low range. The flight crew continued to monitor and made the decision to divert and make a precautionary landing.

Uneventful landing and cleared the runway. After ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) inspected aircraft; taxied to the gate. There were no causal factors; just mechanical failure. As this incident was caused by mechanical failure; there is nothing I can suggest that would prevent this type of event from occurring in the future. However; it is worth noting that due to good policies; procedures and crew coordination; the event was handled in a superior manner.,A321 Captain reported a Green Hydraulic System HYD G RSVR LO LVL ECAM message on departure. The flight crew requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at departure airport.

We departed from Runway XX in ZZZ. Shortly after rotation; I attempted to initiate a stab trim change via our yoke mounted elec trim switches. My elec stab trim switches had failed. I asked the First Officer to test his and they were inoperative as well. We requested to level at 10;000 and receive vectors to allow us to run the 'Stabilizer Trim Inoperative' checklist while utilizing manual trim. The checklist failed to restore operation of the stab trim switches. We elected to [request priority handling] due to the work load of running a non-normal checklist and due to it being a loss of a redundant flight control system. We complied with all instructions on the checklist and landed uneventfully on Runway XXL in ZZZ. Finally; we exited the runway and taxied to gate. Both Captain and First Officer Stab Trim switches remained inoperative throughout the duration of this event to include testing them again upon parking at the gate and returning the cutout switches to normal.,B737 Captain reported stabilizer trim switches failed on departure and a subsequent return to the departure airport.

After an uneventful departure and initial cruise at FL350; ATC routed us direct to ZZZZZ intersection; where we remained in radar contact and VHF coverage. I completed the cruise checks on the system status pages and noted no abnormalities. Approximately 1 hour after takeoff and 100 NM prior to ZZZZZ we received an AIR (L) WING LEAK ECAM. FO Name remained the PF and I ran the ECAM and checklists. I noted that on the system status bleed page the engine bleed valve (L) had closed and the crossed bleed valve was shut. After finishing the ECAM and running the QRH; I used the SAT phone to contact both Dispatch and Operations to discuss the situation. We agreed that the most prudent option was an air-return to ZZZ as we lost the left pack as well as the use of anti-ice (and cloud avoidance couldn't be guaranteed; especially given the weather enroute due to the tropical depression). In the discussion of our circumstance with ATC; FO Name stated that ATC 'initiated the [priority handling' on their end' and after I was brought in the loop; I elected to remain in an priority status and not downgrade it as I wanted to ensure that we had the ability to remain clear of clouds.Once I finished speaking to the company; I notified the flight attendants of our intentions to return to ZZZ; with normal cabin procedures.We noted that we were dispatched with tankering fuel; and therefore would need to burn approximately 800 lbs. to get below max landing weight. I asked for several early step-downs (as there were no clouds between us and ZZZ) as well as running the APU (but ensuring not to open the bleed valve; especially due to the wing leak). We made an uneventful approach and landing on XXL at ZZZ (below max landing weight) and parked next to the spare aircraft that we would then use to fly back to ZZZZ.,A320 Captain reported pressurization pack failed which resulted in a decision to return to the departure airport.

Approximately 45 minutes into the flight we received a radio call from ATC. They informed us that an aircraft departing after us reported tire debris on the Runway XXL in ZZZ. We felt no adverse conditions and the flight attendants reported no adverse noises from the back. I [advised ATC] for the arrival into ZZZ1 out of caution; in case one of our tires was compromised. We choose XXR; this being the longest in ZZZ1; and landed normally. I stopped on the runway and had the safety vehicles look us over. They reported no issues with any tires so we cleared the runway and taxied to the gate. I had one of the safety vehicles follow us until we were safely parked at the gate.,B737-800 flight crew reported being contacted by ATC after takeoff with a report of possible tire failure.

All QRH procedures were accomplished. Due to our original destination (ZZZ1) having a short/wet runway and performance penalties applied we needed a new destination. We talked to dispatch/maintenance over the SATCOM and ACARS. We coordinated with dispatch to make ZZZ2 our new destination where we landed without further issues. The weather in the northeast closed the ZZZ center airspace and we were rerouted due to our destination change. The flight time and fuel burned increased significantly and dispatch had to used exemption XXXXX to void the requirement of and alternate with ZZZ2 as the new destination.,A320 Pilot reported AUTO BRAKE FAULT / BRAKE RELEASED ECAM MSG was illuminated on climb.

We noticed an uncharacteristic vibration; but the aircraft did slow down as commanded. We were required to slow further; and upon using the speed brakes we continued to feel the vibration. A flight attendant called us on the interphone; and informed us that part of the wing was missing. At X;000 feet on the arrival; the flight attendant requested that we see it; and the captain opened the flight deck door in accordance with security procedures; and that is when we saw the extent of the damage. [Priority handling was requested]; and we shot an uneventful approach to RunwayXX. We requested that Crash Fire Rescue follow us to the gate in the event of potential FOD.,Air carrier flight crew reported an unusual aircraft vibration during arrival.

I flew while PM (Pilot Monitoring) ran the ECAM checklist. HYD Quantity was zero. Contacted Dispatch and informed them of the situation and requested runway data for Runway XXC and to have fire equipment and tug ready for our arrival. We determined that [requesting priority handling] with ATC would be helpful and the best course of action due to loss of steering and some of the brake functions along with 1 thrust reverser; as well as possibility of fire from all the fluid loss. I called FA (Flight Attendant) with a briefing of situation and informed her would be a normal landing with some precautions. I informed passengers of same. We requested a 20 mile final so we had extra time for slower flaps and manual gear extension. We slowed to 210 kts. and configured aircraft around 4;000 feet. Normal landing and slowed to safe taxi speed and made [Taxiway] 1 turnoff with differential braking and rudder. Stopped aircraft; set brakes and communicated with fire rescue. No issues; tug was at our aircraft in a few minutes to pull us back to gate after completing tow in checklist after starting APU and shutting down engines.,A320 flight crew reported loss of Green Hydraulic System fluid in flight.

As the aileron deflection required was excessive I was evaluating whether the wind was causing the flight control manipulation required or was the trim off. I scanned the trim settings and everything was centered. As we climbed I determined that lots of rudder trim was needed. I hand flew the airplane whilst attempting to bring it into trim. As the amount of trim needed was getting excessive we scanned the engine indications and flap configuration to see if we had an issue and everything was normal. We continued the climb as we were evaluating the issue. The fuel was balanced and nothing appeared abnormal; we had no hydraulic; feel control warnings etc. Once I reached about 5 units of Left rudder trim the AC was able to fly more level but still had about 2 units of Left aileron deflection. Eventually; around 7 units were needed for a relatively level flight. I engaged the auto pilot and discussed the situation with the First Officer (FO). I passed Pilot Flying (PF) duties to the FO and had him see if he concurred with the present control configuration (the trim we had was required) and he did. I contacted [maintenance] via ACARS and [flight operations] informing them of our situation. Now at altitude I decided to disconnect the Auto Pilot and while hand flying had the FO slowly take out some rudder trim to evaluate if I had mistrimmed or over trimmed. It became apparent quickly that the trim was needed as aileron deflection increased correspondingly. We discussed that the trim was now about where it was when we pre flighted the aircraft. We now thought that that was where it was left by the previous crew and not inadvertently moved as originally thought. A quick review of the flight manual revealed no non normal procedure for this situation. We discussed the situation and whether or not to divert. As this was way out of the normal range for trim and no other abnormalities were present we suspected that the aircraft had a flight control rigging issue. We were concerned that if this condition worsened or we developed any other issue we could easily be put beyond the ability to control the aircraft and decided to [request priority handling]. I had no response from [maintenance] at this point. We made the decision to [request priority handling] and divert. I choose ZZZ1 as it was close; had a long runway; emergency services and lastly customer services. We knew this was going to require an overweight landing but did not think it prudent to burn down as that would have taken hours. Dispatch was informed and quickly got back to us acknowledging the divert and situation. We briefed the plan; the approach; got landing data and considerations for the overweight condition. We conducted an overweight ILS Runway XXR and had a smooth uneventful landing. Emergency responders confirmed that our brake temperatures were good and we proceeded to the gate.,B737 Captain reported excessive trim was required to maintain stable flight and decided to divert for landing.

ZZZZZ1 arrival into ZZZ at FL200 given clearance to descend to 15000 feet by ZZZZZ2. I entered 15000 ft. as a constraint on the FMS and immediately we got a CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULT ECAM message and an OFFSIDE FMS CONTROL on the ND. The AP1 decoupled from NAV mode without any warning or indication and reverted to HDG mode. ECAM procedure said to check landing elevation. Altimeters were set on 29.64 for field setting and landing elevation knob was set to AUTO. Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) had no additional procedures. Captain (CA) FMS was locked and no key selections or line selects would result in any change on FMS display. We alerted ATC to our NAV failure and requested vectors. We transferred controls to the First Officer (FO). We selected AP2 and regained NAV mode. We also determined that the CA ND was visible if the range was set to the same as the FO. We accomplished the Descent checklist and loaded and confirmed the RNAV GPS XXR. We asked for and received an extended vector to final with approach. Upon matching ND range with a good display on the CA side we transferred controls back to the CA. The aircraft was configured for landing between ZZZZZ3 and ZZZZZ4 and was fully configured and stable by ZZZZZ4. Crosswind was approximately 330/25 at around 1000 ft. with a substantial crab and reported by Tower to be 330/9 at the runway. Aircraft was stable at 1000 ft. Approaching the minimums of 520 ft.; I disconnected the Autopilot (AP) and the managed speed bug ran away and the auto-thrust surged causing the aircraft to get high and fast. The FO reached up and dialed back the speed on the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) which reduced thrust and I continued the approach making an aggressive correction to regain the glide path. This caused our speed to be excessive and our glide path to become steep below 500 ft. I had to make an immediate decision to continue or go around and I quickly decided to continue with the unknown system degradation as long as I had glide path on the VASI and the speed/thrust was not erratic. We touched down with a minor bounce and exited the runway at taxiway T. Upon touchdown; all of the ND and PFD and lower ECAM started flashing and flickering in all of the message/mode locations. We called for maintenance to meet us at the gate because we had no idea what we had as a problem. Upon talking with the mechanics we were informed that there was a triple failure within the FMS and that the mechanic had never seen that before. He indicated an FMGCU (Flight Management Guidance Control Unit) failure. The post flight maintenance report indicated a CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULT and a NAV LS TUNING DISAGREE. System degradation from the time of failure when entering /15000 ft. at ZZZZZ2 on the arrival up to and including screen flickering and flashing at touchdown was a complete unknown. I would like to see this failure researched and possibly considered for a safety bulletin. The weather conditions were such that it was relatively easy to recover from the deviation that occurred at AP disconnect; but in IMC it would have been more challenging.,A321 pilot reported systems loss complicated the approach to landing. The Pilot reported that maintenance found a triple failure of the FMS system was caused by the complete failure of the FMC.

AGL we received an HYD Y SYS LO PR message. I flew and operated the radios while the First Officer (FO) performed the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) procedure. While performing the procedure we then observed the expected ECAM HYD Y ENG 2 PUMP LO PR and HYD Y RSVR LO LVL messages and followed those ECAM procedures. The FO then followed up with the QRH. I then transferred the aircraft controls to the FO and evaluated the non-routine landing considerations. We were approximately 185;000 pounds so any diversion would result in an overweight landing. I did not want to combine this with a compromised hydraulic status; so the decision was made to continue to ZZZ1 and land on the longest runway. We later received a HYD Y RSVR OVHT message and performed the ECAM procedures; and determined that it was acceptable with no Y hydraulic pumps operating and Y hydraulic level indicating zero. We informed ATC that we had a hydraulic system malfunction but would be continuing to ZZZ1. ATC recommended that once we were in contact with ZZZ Center we should notify them that we would need safety vehicles standing by for Runway XXR. Upon contact with ZZZ Center we [advised ATC] and were given clearance to fly direct to ZZZ1. We asked for a long final approach because of the slower than normal gear and flap extension speeds. Flew a stable approach and normal landing. Stopped on the runway and everything thing checked normal. Maintenance approached aircraft and towed the aircraft to the gate.,A321 flight crew reported a Hydraulic System failure. The crew continued to the destination and landed uneventfully.

Standby airspeed indicated properly. Once airborne; ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) messages indicated that the aircraft was in alternate law and had no autopilot or auto thrust. CA and FO had no flight directors. Upon flap retraction; flaps jammed (leading edge slats failed to retract). ECAM displayed use manual pitch trim. Unable to manually trim aircraft pitch. Aircraft was nose-heavy. Required continuous aft stick pressure to maintain level flight. Believe maximum flap/slat speed exceeded. [Requested priority handling]. Returned to ZZZ. Able to configure aircraft to flaps 3. Upon gear extension; regained normal pitch authority. Uneventful landing and rollout. After clearing the runway; flaps retracted normally. Aircraft logbook indicated that the #3 pitot tube had been replaced due to being clogged. The logbook also indicated the aircraft had a hard landing on the previous flight. Multiple system failures. I do not know the cause of the system failures and therefore do not have any suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again. Previous simulator training with simulated systems failures was definitely helpful in this situation.,A321 Pilot reported loss of airspeed indications on both the Captain's and first Officer's PFDs. The flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

We then had an Integrated drive generator 1 oil temp high and we disconnected Integrated drive generator 1. The airplane was in alternate law with no autopilot or auto thrust. At this point we believed trying to land ASAP was the best decision. We requested Runway XX at ZZZ. We kept the Flight Attendants updated but let them know that a brace call was unnecessary and that it should be a normal landing. We landed and taxied in without incident.,A320 Captain reported a dual generator failure during descent and a subsequent diversion for landing.

SYS 2 worked normally. Referenced the FM and continued. At FL340; received 'CAB PR EXCESS ALT' ECAM with associated master warning. We flew the airplane; silenced the alarm and confirmed the [problem]. The Captain directed me to continue to fly the aircraft and we donned our masks and established comms. He got clearance to descend from ATC and I initiated our descent. The ECAM cleared and reappeared at least once during the descent. During the descent; the Captain let the flight attendants (FAs) know what was going on and they mentioned that the emergency lights came on but that the masks did not drop. We leveled at 10;000 ft. and elected to return back to ZZZ1 since the FAs reported that there were no injuries on board. I coordinated the return with ATC while the Captain informed the passengers of what had happened and communicated with Dispatch. On final at ZZZ1; we received a 'CAB PR LO DIFF' ECAM that cleared on its own after a few seconds. The Captain elected to land the aircraft since we had [priority] and we were overweight by about 5k lbs. We landed without incident and returned under our own power to the gate.,A320 First Officer reported an EICAS message warned of a malfunction with the #1 pressurization system during climb out. Later another warning regarding the pressurization system appeared. The pilots descended to a lower altitude and returned to the departure airport.

I was the Captain and pilot flying on the flight [to] BOS. Flight was uneventful until short final when the actual winds and the programmed winds began to differ greatly; causing an increased mini groundspeed (Airbus gust correction) of 150 kts. vs programmed approach speed of 139. This increased ground speed; light weight; gusty winds; and delayed power reduction because of speed required; caused a ballooned flare which floated the aircraft out of the touchdown zone. Additionally; Runway 27 is only 7000 ft.; making the touchdown zone even more critical; therefore; I executed a go-around. There was a helicopter crossing departure end of 27; forcing an aggressive climb to 3000 ft. We were vectored back around for a second attempt at ILS 27; however; we were vectored 6 miles in trail of an A330 and given specific speeds that maintained that spacing on final. Due to winds of 340/13G19 and the 7000 ft. runway; the wake of the preceding A330 caused the aircraft to balloon and float out of a safe landing position again; forcing a second go-around from landing position. The go-around was uneventful; however; due to approaching reserve fuel levels; we elected to declare minimum fuel and requested vectors to Runway 33; to be more aligned with the prevailing winds and on the longer runway. Approach and landing were uneventful and we arrived at the gate with exactly 3;900 lbs. fuel; our reserve for that flight.,A320 flight crew reported executing two go-arounds at BOS in gusty wind conditions. The second go-around also involved a wake turbulence encounter.

She said multiple FAs and passengers smelled it; and passengers were concerned. We put on our oxygen masks; turned on Engine Anti-Ice; and shut off Pack 2 per COM. I [requested priority handling]; got cleared direct to the FAF; and requested paramedics meet us at the gate in case anyone was feeling unwell. The FO (First Officer) called the lead FA back; and she said the smell stopped; so we took off our oxygen masks. There was never any smell in the cockpit. The FO coordinated with Operations to ensure we had an open gate; and advised Dispatch via ACARS. Everything was in place to allow us to park immediately and deplane normally. I requested the ground crew not connect the air conditioning. Paramedics and Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting boarded the aircraft; but no one requested medical assistance. After all the passengers were off; the whole crew debriefed with Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting and local Maintenance. At this time; the FAs said there was a passenger who took their shoes off. They said it was possible this may have been the source of the smell; but they weren't sure. They said the smell was pervasive in the cabin; but did not seem to be coming from the air vents.I wrote up a discrepancy in the logbook and filled out a Cabin Odor Reporting Sheet. I called Maintenance Control; Dispatch; and the Chief Pilot to report the event.,Air carrier Captain reported being notified by the lead Flight Attendant of a fume event during descent. Flight crew continued to the destination airport where a safe landing was executed.

The takeoff; climb; cruise; and descent went as expected. During the Descent to Approach phase; we did receive a Master Caution Light for the YAW DAMPER. The Captain ran the QRH and the resolution was to not exceed Flaps 30; End of Checklist. During the approach phase on a visual for Runway XXL; we join the localizer for XXL at ZZZZZ. I was the pilot flying (PF) so I called for 'Flaps 1' to begin to slow back to 210 kts. We had the proceeding aircraft insight and the field; so we called both 'in-sight' to ATC. We got cleared for the visual XXL following traffic and were instructed to slow back to '170 kts.' to a 5 NM Final. Given the heavy traffic congestion that night going into ZZZ1 and the proceeding traffic in-front of us; I continued to call for FLAPs 5; then Gear Down with Flaps 15; then eventually Flaps 25. The Captain mentioned that I was going too fast for Flaps 25. That's when we both noticed the Amber Ban on the Airspeed indicator was greater than our bugged speeds. At that same moment we both noticed our flaps never extended out of Flaps UP which explains why we had a hard time slowing down. We both determined we needed to Go-Around. We were instructed to turn left heading 250 and maintain 4;000. We executed the missed approach procedure and reconfigured the airplane to level flight. I turned on the Autopilot and kept my speed around 210 kts. Not having too much fuel onboard (had around 6;000 pounds of fuel) I didn't want to get too far away from the airport as we were problem solving the flap issue. Once reaching clean configuration; the Captain gave me the airplane and he ran the QRH to determine what the problem was. Talking with ATC; I knew we had some sort of FLAP Malfunction and told him we will need Runway XXR. I started to set up the aircraft for the ILS XXR. After a few short vectors; the Captain determined we should plan for a FLAPS UP landing. We gathered FLAPS UP landing numbers and re-bugged the aircraft. The approach and landing went as planned. We touchdown and exited around Taxiway 1 in ZZZ1 where we had the fire trucks waiting for us. We had the fire trucks follow us into the ramp area to make sure everything looked good on the airplane. After entering the ramp area and executing the after landing check; everything looked normal to us. We asked the ramp to [for] the fire trucks to be waived off. We arrived at the gate and completed our post flight duties and then contacted Dispatch and the Duty Pilot.,B737 flight crew reported a yaw damper fail message and flap malfunction while on approach. The crew broke off the approach; ran checklists; and configured the aircraft for a successful landing.

Continued takeoff roll and through approximately 125-130 knots with a V1 speed of 166 knots the same EICAS caution message reappeared and remained and I made the decision to reject the takeoff. Immediate action items were followed and Tower was notified of rejection. I made the decision to roll to the end of the runway in hopes the brakes would be less likely to overheat considering in part aircraft weight /speed and runway length. We cleared runway at end and I stopped aircraft on parallel taxiway to complete checklists and assess brake conditions. The fire personnel had been notified and were proceeding to aircraft as we stopped on taxiway. I believe Tower personnel had made that notification to the fire personnel. We were in contact with Fire/ Rescue personnel commander on VHF 2. The brake temperatures eventually began to rise and the Fire/Rescue lead could see some smoke and at some point said possibly a flame; they sprayed water on wheel truck. This produced immediate results and temperatures were lowered and no further visible smoke or fire evidence. I did not feel evacuation was necessary and the Fire/Rescue lead agreed with that judgment as well as Copilot's. At some point Fire/Rescue advised the number 2 tire had deflated as a protection. Maintenance Control and ZZZZ Operations were all utilized. With the brake temperatures now at normal readings and in coordination with Fire Rescue and Operations the passengers were briefed on deplaning with airstairs onto buses and brought to terminal. Eventually the entire [crew] left the plane onto a bus. Operations/maintenance lead confirmed the aircraft would be towed for inspections.,Air Carrier Captain reported a high speed rejected takeoff due to low hydraulic quantity warnings which resulted in overheated brakes; possible brake fire; and a tire deflating.

Approximately 100 E/NE ZZZ2 while at FL340 at XA50Z; while deviating north for weather; the flight crew received a Master Caution and ECAM for HYD SYS LO PRSR for the Yellow Hydraulic System. Subsequently; a FLT CNTRL ECAM was received due a partial spoiler deployment (#4) on the right wing. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying and the Captain was the Pilot Monitoring. All QRC; ECAM; QRH and follow-up procedures were completed by the Pilot Monitoring. While the Pilot Flying continued the weather deviation; the Pilot Monitoring conferred with dispatch on flight options and diversion details; to include the NOTAMs for ZZZ2. A request for priority handling was made and a diversion to ZZZ2 with ATC priority radar vectors for descent. Coordination via a precautionary landing brief to the flight attendants and passenger PA were also completed. Additional information regarding the partial spoiler deployment was obtained via communication between the Pilot Monitoring and the number one Flight Attendant via a visual inspection of the right wing. There was a noticeable right wing dip at altitude and increased buffet and droop during the descent and approach phase of flight. The Pilot Flying executed a visual approach; with the electronic means of backup using the ILS XXR to an underweight landing (132;000 pounds). After clearing the Runway; an Airport Rescue and Firefighting vision inspection was executed; with the crew confirming flight crew suspicions of hydraulic fluid loss along the belly of the aircraft. With the Green; Blue hydraulic systems intact; the aircraft was taxied to Gate XX. Cause was determined to be the mechanical failure of Yellow System Reservoir. ECAM status page mentions approach phase procedures which result in return of HYD SYS LO PRSR ECAM warning (engine pump on) which can confuse with electric pump on since both work with Yellow System.,A319 Captain reported the flight crew received a Master Caution and ECAM for HYD SYS LO PRSR for the Yellow Hydraulic System. Subsequently; a FLT CNTRL ECAM was received due a partial spoiler deployment (#4) on the right wing. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

The first officer got into his seat and the fire extinguisher fell off its mount. Onto flight deck floor. We put it back on mount but latch would not secure very tight; but held the extinguisher. During the after takeoff flow and checklist we found the gear lights disagreed and gear did not retract. 3 red and 3 green. Overhead lights all green. Ran QRH for gear handle in off position which determined gear down and locked. At the time we were 20;000 lbs. overweight. Asked for holding to burn fuel below max landing weight approx. 2.0 hours. Passenger and Flight Attendant briefed and checks completed. During communication with Dispatch was told to check manual gear extension door that was not in our QRH FLOW FOR GEAR IN OFF POSITION. Door was unlatched due to fire extinguisher falling on it. We did not see it or catch it due to IMC terrain and high work load. We then got gear to operate normally after latching door closed. At that time we had burned too much fuel to continue to ZZZ1. Burned fuel down landed uneventfully under max weight. Fire extinguisher latch and manual gear ext door was written up and put in logbook.,B737 flight crew reported a Cockpit Fire Extinguisher fell from its mounts and struck the Emergency Gear Extend Door. On take off; all gear unsafe lights illuminated and the landing gear did not retract. The flight crew contacted maintenance and was advised to re-close the door and the landing gear were successfully retracted.

We executed a missed approach and due to the wet runway and wind shear conditions we diverted to ZZZ2. We ran the FM procedures; notified Dispatch and briefed the flight attendants on the plan. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Approach. We executed the ILS Runway XXR to ZZZ2 to an uneventful full stop. During the ILS Runway XXR the flaps operated and indicated normally and we landed with flaps 30. Maintenance inspected the aircraft and returned it to service. We continued to ZZZ1 within our duty day to a normal landing at ZZZ1.,Captain reported trailing edge flaps failed to extend past 25 degrees during final approach. The flight crew performed a go around and elected to divert due to weather.

As pilot flying; I completed the memory items and retarded the left thrust lever to get the engine back into limits. This resulted in about a 20% reduction in thrust. We climbed to 6;000 ft and completed the QRC checklist. Upon level off; I engaged the A/P and transferred flying duties to the First Officer; F/O. I relayed to ATC that a return to ZZZ was likely; but needed time to confer with Dispatch. I established comms with Dispatch and Maintenance; and it was decided to return to ZZZ. The F/O and I completed all required checklists and an uneventful landing ensued on Runway XXL. Upon landing rollout; firefighting personnel checked the brake temp. It was within limits and we taxied back to the gate. Overall a very uneventful event.,B737 Captain reported the left engine indicated an over temperature on departure; resulting a return to the departure airport.

I asked what it smelled like and if they could figure out the location. They could not and on the flight deck only smelled it faintly after several minutes. By the time we smelled it in the flight deck the Flight Attendants called back and said it was gone. Over the next several minutes we discussed what we thought it smelled like and I began to look up ZZZZZ frequency so I could give the company a heads up. Before I could make the call we received a call from the Flight Attendants letting us know the smell came back and were in the process of trying to locate the origin. I again asked them what they thought it smelled like and at that point; it became very pronounced on the flight deck. It was a strong burning plastic mixed with an electrical odor. At that point we performed immediate action items for smoke; fire; fumes by donning our masks and establishing communication. The FO (First Officer) took over the radios while I continued with the checklist and called the Flight Attendants. The FO told ATC we needed lower. He informed them we had smoke on the flight deck and [requested priority handling]. Shortly after I informed ATC it was actually fumes on the flight deck not smoke. At first he asked for vectors to ZZZ but after getting the weather we decided ZZZ1 was a better option. I continued with as much of the checklist as I could. I called the Flight Attendants to let them know we would be on the ground in less then 10 minutes and made an announcement to the passengers. A landing was performed in ZZZ1 on Runway XX. We stopped on the runway and had the fire trucks do a visual inspection. They saw nothing out of the ordinary. We taxied to the gate.,B737 flight crew reported a fume event during cruise which was described as a 'burning odor'. Flight crew ran the QRH and diverted to an airport where a safe landing was executed.

After flap retraction was complete departing ZZZ2 (flaps indicated fully retracted; LE Flap Transit light out); the LE Flap Transit light came back on; accompanied by the green fully extended indication for the #4 Leading Edge Flap segment. The First Officer (FO) continued to fly; and I ran the Leading Edge Flaps Transit checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). We followed the checklist; which directs you to cycle flaps to 1; and back to off. This step did not clear the malfunction. The checklist directs a flaps 15 landing; and calls for a Non-Normal configuration landing distance. Since we had run the QRH; and were computing a non-normal landing distance; we decided to divert to ZZZ1 vs. returning to ZZZ2 or continuing on to ZZZ3. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ (QRH + Non-normal landing made this seem like the right choice). They put us on the ZZZZZ arrival for the ILS Runway X. Descent; approach; and landing were uneventful. I had the FO land the aircraft. Aircraft configuration was normal for a landing. We lowered the landing gear about 1/2 way to ZZZ1 to reduce landing weight; about 155000 lbs. at take-off. I referenced the Overweight Landing checklist; and computed landing distance about 6000 ft. at 150000 lbs. landing weight. Actual landing weight was 149000 lbs.; touchdown was normal. I made MEL entries for the flap malfunction and the overweight landing. I had coordinated the diversion with Dispatch via ACARS during the flight; and I called to discuss the event after landing to include the overweight landing. We changed aircraft and continued on to ZZZ3.Weather at ZZZ2 was heavy rain; wet runway; braking action medium on arrival. Based on the ZZZ2 weather; we had pre briefed using ZZZ1 as our recovery base for a malfunction on take-off. ZZZ1 had been our alternate for the flight inbound to ZZZ2; so we had relatively current ZZZ1 weather and NOTAMs available. Two procedural suggestions for the QRH as posted. Need to be able to access this document without entering any passwords or login information; period. Company asking for a login when you NEED the QRH is decidedly not helpful. A more easily usable 'page back' function would be extremely helpful in the aircraft. The small arrow prompt in the bottom corner of the page is not very user friendly.,B737-800 Captain reported a flap malfunction and divert to land at the nearest suitable airport. The reporter also stated the software app to access the QRH is burdensome.

Once armed; we received multiple EICAS messages (3 pages) of system failures. I lost background lighting and multiple instruments. I looked up at the electrical panel and noted the STBY PWR OFF Light illuminated. After requesting priority handling; I handed the Paper QRH to the International Relief Officer and instructed her to read the Standby Power Off checklist. We complied with the checklist and continued the approach to an uneventful landing.On rollout; I took control of the aircraft; and through 100 kts.; felt the airplane being sluggish. I stated I thought we had blown tires; as our inboard tires had no anti-skid protection. We cleared the runway; and noted the break temp monitors were at 9 on my outboard brakes. I called Tower to ensure services were enroute; and wanted them to focus on our main landing gear in case of fire. Once ensured there was no fire; I contacted Ops; Dispatch; Maintenance Control to make everyone aware of our situation. After approximately 30 minutes I was informed that all 8 main tires were flat. Air stairs were brought to the aircraft; and all passengers and crew egressed with no injuries. We were taken by bus to the main terminal.Before leaving the aircraft; an ELB write up was accomplished. Upon further investigation of the logbook's history; I see there was a similar write up of a 'hard power transfer' when the approach mode was selected with multiple EICAS messages. In their case; they never lost STBY PWR; as in mine. Seems there was an electric anomaly with this jet that was never found by Maintenance. In my opinion; the paper QRH should not be removed from our aircraft; as it was the fastest means for us to accomplish a lengthy checklist before landing; as this problem presented itself at a very inopportune moment on approach.This is an addendum to a previous report. It was brought to my attention after landing that the speed brakes failed to deploy; and the crew missed that fact with all our attention focused on failed systems; checklists; and flying the airplane. Upon landing my focus was squarely on keeping the airplane tracking the runway center line. In the end; with the length of runway; I do not believe the speed brakes were a factor in the final outcome of the flight.,B767 Captain reported a hard power transfer caused the loss of multiple systems. The flight crew requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at destination airport.

Flight Attendant notified us of odors in the cabin. We did not have odors in the flight deck. We [requested priority handling] and landed immediately. After landing and clearing the runway; I spoke to Flight Attendant who indicated that the odor had dissipated. We then taxied to the gate uneventfully. The flight was met by emergency personnel. No injuries were reported.,Air carrier Captain reported being notified by a flight attendant of odors in the cabin during final approach. Flight crew requested and received special handling and continued for a safe landing.

A fuel imbalance existed between the main tanks with the left tank being about 500 pounds lower than the right. The cross feed was turned on to correct the imbalance and we got it to stabilize at about a 600 pound difference. While at a cruise altitude of FL360 we received a master caution light indicating 'LOW ENGINE IDLE'. We noticed that the left N1 was falling and then the autopilot kicked off. Pilot Flying took control of the aircraft and we quickly determined that we had lost engine 1 and we were going to return to ZZZZ. ATC was informed of our desire to return and [requested priority handling]. Number 2 engine gauges were indicating normal and number 1 engine gauges were not indicating anything abnormal aside from the failure; but the all three fuel gauges read '-0' before eventually returning to accurate fuel readings a few minutes later. We descended from 360; ran the 'Engine Failure' and 'Engine In- Flight Start' QRH checklists. We started the APU at FL240 and performed a starter assisted engine restart around FL190. We successfully restarted engine 1 and returned to ZZZZ without further incidence. Currently undetermined. Potential fuel flow issue; maintenance is looking into the event.,First Officer reported #1 Engine flamed out at cruise due to a fuel imbalance. The flight crew descended to restart the engine and returned to the departure airport.

It was less than five seconds before we had O2 masks on. We established comms and then Captain began coordinating for lower altitude while I started a controlled descent based on the fact that the cabin altitude and cabin rate weren't pegged. While working through the QRC/QRH the pressurization stabilized while descending and we elected to level off at 26;000 feet instead of 19;000 feet; which was our clearance.With the cabin pressure returning to around 6;000 feet; we elected to stay on O2 for a little while longer to allow for faster recovery from hypoxia symptoms. Checked the weather in ZZZ (VMC) and confirmed fuel requirements and elected to continue to ZZZ basted on the time en route; fuel requirements and weather at the field. I had symptoms of hypoxia almost immediately; which included tingly skin; chest tightness; heavy arms; light headedness; and a sinus headache. Most symptoms subsided within 20-30 minutes; but the headache lasted for several hours. We landed without further incident at ZZZ.,B737-700 First Officer reported loss of cabin pressure control. The flight crew requested priority handling and descended. The flight crew elected to continue to destination airport and make a precautionary landing.

At about XA30Z got an ECAM for; HYD Y RSVR LO LVL. Referenced the quick action document and verified that this ECAM was neither a quick action item or an ECAM exception. Completed the ECAM actions; Checked the QRH for any supplemental or follow up procedures. I then called Dispatch on SAT phone; spoke with both Dispatcher and Maintenance. All involved agreed we could continue flight to ZZZ. [Requested priority handling] with ZZZ Approach because with the loss of the Yellow Hydraulic System nose wheel steering is lost so we would need to stop on the Runway after landing and be towed to the gate. Normal landing and rollout; stopped on Runway. ZZZ Fire Commander inspected the aircraft and said all was good and we could be towed to the gate.,Captain reported an ECAM for HYD Y RSVR LO LVL at cruise. The flight crew continued to destination airport and landed.

At approximately 1;900 feet AGL after the landing checklist was completed on a visual approach to Runway XXL into ZZZ; we received a message ENG 1 EGT OVER LIMIT on the ECAM. It initially went away quickly but within 5-10 seconds reappeared. The First Officer was flying with the Auto thrust and Autopilot off and thrust levers were already at idle. The ECAM directed ENG MASTER 1.....OFF. This then prompted the ENG 1 SHUTDOWN ECAM procedure. After following this procedure; we [requested priority handling] and landed on [Runway] XXL without incident. We notified ZZZ Tower that we would be stopping on the Runway. We stopped about 1;000 feet short of Taxiway 1. We called for Flight Attendants stations and after determining the engine was secured and cooling off; I called 'remain seated' 3 times over the PA. We cleared the Runway and stopped short of Taxiway 2 on 1 to wait for Crash Fire Rescue . Crash Fire Rescue approached the aircraft and we asked them to check on the number 1 engine. Crash Fire Rescue indicated that they did not see any evidence of fluid; smoke; or fire. We taxied on #2 engine and had Crash Fire Rescue follow us to Gate XX. After the parking checklist; Maintenance was called; Chief Pilot on Duty reached out to me; and a logbook entry was made.,Captain reported a message ENG 1 EGT OVER LIMIT on the ECAM during approach and performed an in flight shut down of the #1 engine. The flight crew continued to landing; and after inspection taxied to the gate.

We accomplished the immediate actions items for this event and I called for the checklist. While accomplishing the Cabin Altitude Checklist; we noted that the Cabin Altitude was continuing to rise to 10;000 ft.; so I requested priority handling and directed the F/O (First Officer) to start an immediate descent. I informed ATC that we were starting this immediate descent to 10;000 ft. MSL. The Cabin Altitude started to decrease as we descended. After leveling off at 10;000 ft.; I asked to proceed direct to ZZZ. After resetting our cruise altitude in the FMC; I saw that our arrival fuel was projected to be 7.5. I contacted Dispatch via ACARS to inform him of my plan to continue to ZZZ at 10;000 ft. I also contacted the Dispatcher on SATCOM. I informed the Flight Attendants of the pressurization problem during the descent. I contacted them again during cruise at 10;000 ft. to ask if the masks had dropped; and if any of the Passengers noticed anything strange to determine whether or not to make a PA. They told me the masks did not drop and none of the Passengers noticed anything; so I decided a PA was not warranted. We proceeded direct to ZZZ and landed with no further problems.There were several issues/mistakes which the FO and I discussed after the fact. We skipped the QRC and went straight to the QRH. We should have complied with the QRH step to activate the Passenger Oxygen System. Even though the cabin altitude was not climbing rapidly; the fact that I felt the need for an immediate descent to control Cabin Altitude means I did not feel the Cabin Altitude was under control. I should have considered stopping the descent before reaching 10;000 ft. when Cabin Altitude was within limits. We forgot to accomplish QRH deferred items. One additional note: We flew this aircraft from ZZZ2 to ZZZ1 at FL 320 without noticing a cabin altitude problem.,B737-700 Captain reported a Cabin Altitude Warning Horn and a Cabin Altitude of 9;500 feet in cruise. The Captain requested priority handling and directed the First Officer to descend to 10;000 feet. The flight crew elected to continue to destination airport at 10;000 feet and make a precautionary landing.

The First Officer was flying and after checking for an ECAM exception or quick action item I assigned flying duties and ATC communications to the First Officer. I completed the ECAM actions which failed to remedy the situation so I advised the First Officer to head to ZZZ1. I made a quick PA since it was very noisy just to put everyone at ease while I pulled out my QRH then completed the appropriate follow up items. I then notified the #1 Flight Attendant with the test items then made another PA explaining the situation. I then used the crew phone to call Dispatch and they were aware we were headed to ZZZ1. Since we were going to land at 182;000 pounds I reviewed the overweight landing checklist and discussed the options with the First Officer. The weather was clear with calm winds and a long Runway so decided it was best to land rather than burn off gas for an hour or more. I also called Dispatch to tell them my intention to make an overweight landing. The First Officer made the landing and everything was normal so we taxied to the Gate.,A321 flight crew reported after takeoff the nose wheel and doors would not retract. A divert and an overweight landing were accomplished.

After consulting the QRH and Dispatch a return to ZZZ was coordinated. [We advised ATC] or the situation and the overweight landing. Landing was normal with no further incident.Suggestion - Maintenance take a closer look at the aircraft since it has been an uptick of this incidents.,Air Carrier Captain reported Flight Attendant notification of an 'acrid wet socks' odor during climb.. After completion of the QRH  procedures and conferring with Dispatch the flight crew requested special handling to return to airport where a safe landing was accomplished.

Dispatcher explained there was a deferred item that had to be cleared before he would unlock the flight plan; as the plane was only allowed to fly between Maintenance bases with that item. I asked to have it released so I could review the aircraft issue. He declined. Maintenance was at the gate; they removed the Maintenance Discrepancy. I reviewed the original write ups which appeared to start at the end of month with the last one on Date. The write ups described a lot of noise through 270 knots with slight airframe vibration. Several doors had been replaced; etc. There had been no additional reports following the Date write up. On departure; as we accelerated to 270 knots; a loud humming noise with noticeable; but slight; airframe vibration occurred and continued as we accelerated. I called back to the flight attendants and they said they also could hear and feel it; including all the way in the back. They thought it sounded like the 'engines were revving.' The engines all showed normal indications. While we do have an engine vibration checklist; (which was NOT indicated) we don't have an airframe vibration or loud humming noise checklist. I elected to return to ZZZ to have Maintenance assess for airworthiness to ZZZ1.The plane had been operating solely in and out of maintenance bases for several weeks so I didn't think it was a good idea to take it to a special use airport; with a very short runway; until it's airworthiness to land at ZZZ1 could be assessed. I have been flying only Boeing planes for [decades] now. I haven't heard a noise like that before. That led to my unease in continuing to ZZZ1 with the issue unresolved. Further; I start and finish most of my trips in and out of ZZZ1. Consequently I am very familiar with the challenges of that airport. While I've taken planes with all kinds of maintenance issues in and out of there from MEL auto throttles to auto brakes; those issues were all 'known.' This one was 'unknown.'Maintenance issues are part of our environment. When they occur; we have to make the safest decision we can balancing known risks and operational integrity. A flight check with maintenance on board prior to removing the deferred Item would likely have helped them identify the problem? While saying that; I recognize there were a lot of flights that didn't report anything since Date.,B737-800 Captain reported concerns over clearing of a Deferred Item. During flight; an airframe vibration was felt; exactly as contained in the Deferred Item. The Captain reported the incident to Maintenance.

During our climb to FL290; I noticed the Cabin Pressure was blinking green (on and off) reading 9;550 ft. as we flew through FL260. I mention this to the Captain who told me to level off. About 5 seconds later we got a Master Warning with associated aural sounds; the ECAM showed CAB PR in red. The Captain ordered oxygen mask on and for me to initiate a priority descent to 11;000 ft. During the descent; the Captain checked the QRC; assigned flying/communications duties to me and executed the ECAM/QRH procedures. The Captain also coordinated with the Flight Attendants; Dispatch; myself and ATC; he was extremely busy. After reaching 11;000 ft.; the remaining normal briefing/checklist items were also completed. We landed without any further issues and stopped on the Runway for inspection by CFR personnel. The Captain's use of CRM was fantastic. On several occasions he asked for my opinion and kept the Flight Attendants fully informed of the situation; his flight deck leadership was outstanding. I am very grateful for the opportunity to have flown with such a professional; competent and distinguished Captain. The AML had a previous entry regarding a pressurization issue. This aircraft had an entry regarding this issue. The maintenance corrective action for that entry should be reviewed to see if it had anything to do with this event.,A319 First Officer reported During climb to FL290; they noticed the Cabin Pressure was blinking green (on and off) reading 9;550 as we flew through FL260. About 5 seconds later a Master Warning with associated aural sounds; the ECAM showed CAB PR in red. The flight crew began an immediate descent to 10;000 feet. The flight crew continued at that altitude to destination airport and recorded the issue in the log book. This was a repeat discrepancy from the prior flight.

There was no ECAM associated with this anomaly. We leveled at 17;000 ft. to troubleshoot and stop the cabin pressure gain. We reviewed the QRC and QRH and followed QRH procedure to switch the Cabin Pressure Controller system and attempted to regain control in Manual mode. This did not correct the problem; so we returned to the departure field. We followed overweight landing procedures via the QRH; requested priority handling; and returned to an uneventful landing at ZZZ. Minimal sink rate at touchdown and no hot brakes issue resulted. Pressurization system maintenance had been previously performed and written up on a previous flight. System malfunction. No suggestions at this date.,A319 flight crew reported pressurization control system malfunctions on climbout. The flight crew ran the checklists and QRH and were unable regain control. The flight crew requested priority handling and performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

The Flight Attendant (FA) stated 'there's a fire in the cabin and a lot of smoke; I'll call you back'. My First Officer (FO) and I looked at the engine instruments and pressurization panels; everything looking normal. My FO pulled the QRC and QRH. I [requested special handling] and requested radar vector for a diversion to ZZZ1; which was about 80 miles off our nose.When I got back to my FO; he briefed me on the situation. A passenger had a small electronic device inside her purse; filling the cabin with smoke. They pulled and used the fire extinguisher; reached to the device and put it in a containment bag. I made the decision to deviate from our company procedures; which call for running the QRC/QRH because the source of the smoke was determined and they were no smoke or smell in the flight deck. My concern was to land the aircraft at the most suitable airport in point of time since the FA was still concerned by the smell.We believe the smell was the residual from the fire extinguisher discharge; but I could be wrong and didn't want to delay the landing. We set up the approach; ran the appropriate checklists and received [landing data] for an overweight landing. The Fire Department made a wheel well inspection and convened with Dispatch that it was safe to park at the gate with the parking brake off. I want to commend our Flight Attendants for the way they handled the situation. They kept us informed of the development of the incident; which helped us in our assessments. We didn't have to second guess and run the risk of calling for the wrong check lists. My FO did a tremendous job of being the liaison between the FA and myself; allowing me to focus on flying the aircraft first. He also kept the passengers informed of our intention.,Air carrier flight crew reported a battery charger experienced a thermal runaway during cruise. The Flight Attendants utilized the thermal containment bag to contain the device while the flight diverted to a nearby airport where a safe landing was made.

We were in light chop so I wasn't overly concerned. Once at cruise altitude in smooth air; I felt a slight bump and noticed the vertical speed show approximately 600-700 FPM descent. The autopilot immediately arrested the decent and maintained altitude. No ECAM message was received. A few minutes later it reoccurred. A minor thump followed by a momentary pitch down. This continued several times and seemed to be increasing but only slightly. Considering the aircraft had been written up the previous flight for 'F/CTL ELEV SERVO FAULT DISPLAYED IN FLIGHT LEFT ELEV GREEN HYD SYSTEM '  and signed off with 'RESET ELAC 1 AND 2 OPS CK GOOD' we were concerned about possibility of the situation becoming worse and decided to divert to ZZZ. I slowed the aircraft to see if that would somehow resolve the issue to no avail. The aircraft continued with the thump and pitch issues at least 15 times during the flight.  We landed in ZZZ safely. Captain contacted maintenance and tracking. We received a call and we were treated very well and professionally.Cause - Possibly a quick sign off on the previous flightSuggestion - Possibly more follow up on write ups especially flight control issues,A319 Pilot reported unusual thump followed by a momentary pitch down which continued several times. Considering the aircraft had been written up the previous flight for F/CTL ELEV SERVO FAULT DISPLAYED IN FLIGHT LEFT ELEV GREEN HYD SYSTEM  and signed off with RESET ELAC 1 AND 2 OPS CK GOOD; the flight crew was concerned the situation might worsen and decided to divert.

While on the ZZZZZ Arrival Crossed ZZZZZ [fix] 210 Knots and 6;000 feet. ATC directed to 3;000 feet; then HDG 070. As PM I selected Flaps 1 and then HDG 070; 170 KIAS and F5 as I extended course for ILS XXR. Noted that the Amber Leading Edge Flap Transit Light remained illuminated and Flaps had stopped close to F1 but still between 0-1. Began QRH Leading Edge Flap Transit light as the initial condition. After identifying QRH Ck list with PF; I realized that I needed more time to complete the QRH and might have to complete a Flaps up landing if we were not able to provide F15 through alt flap extension procedures so [requested priority handling] provided reason as flap malfunction with souls on board and fuel remaining and requested ILS XXL for ZZZ longest runway. Next Requested long vectors and a turn out at present altitude. ATC sent us north toward ZZZ2 to de conflict with vectors and a climb to 4;000 feet. After completing initial QRH steps for Leading Edge Flap Transit Light; Flap condition 0-1 no asymmetry and  then followed Ck list to its conclusion in the Alternate Flap Extension procedure. When on a long final manually set flaps to F15 using alt flap ext procedure and reviewed F15 landing data I had requested from dispatch. Once the dual response landing checklist was completed and briefing finished; broadcast to ATC that we planned a normal F15 landing; no further assistance; repeated same to ZZZ tower when asked and reiterated a normal F15 landing no further assistance. Repeated same after uneventful landing and taxi to gate. Called  Dispatch; Operations and made maintenance write up for the condition.Being familiar with the long and specific QRH for Leading Edge Flap Transit light and it's possible outcomes; I chose to [advise ATC] to receive both priority handling; time and the longest runway in the event of Flaps UP landing. Knowing I could possibly achieve a normal landing and in the best case. Glad it all went according to QRH best case...and we had time to review and execute the correct Ck list and follow the complicated decision tree without outside pressure.,B737-900 Captain reported Amber Leading Edge Flap Transit Light remained illuminated and Flaps had stopped close to F1 but still between 0-1 on approach. The flight crew continued to destination airport and completed a safe landing.

Few moments later R1 OVERHEAT Caution light came on with additional cracking; delaminating; and electrical odor. Executed Damaged Window/Windshield QRH (quick reference handbook) checklist. Continued on approach; [requested priority] with Approach to facilitate additional slowing of aircraft.  Landed without further incidence; proceeded to gate. Completed AML (approved mode list) entry.  Would like to thank ATC and ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) for their attention and assistance. The only coincidental factor is that we had the wind screens cleaned off by station personnel. The window heat was turned off for the execution of the cleaning. Possibly causing a thermal shock to windshields.,A B737-800 Air Carrier pilot reported the cockpit window cracked while descending to land.

We requested a level off from ATC and the CA asked me to run the Non-Normal 700/800/900/ER Stabilizer Out of Trim checklist. Following each step; we confirmed the stabilizer was not trimming with the autopilot engaged; the CA turned off the auto pilot/throttles; we confirmed the stabilizer was not properly responding to manual electric trim inputs (i.e. only nose down trim inputs were able to be applied electrically); and; we took note the last step directed us to execute the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative procedure next. At that point; the CA asked me to contact the Flight Attendants; give them a synopsis of our situation; and request they bring the Company 737 CA up to the cockpit to render assistance. Upon entering the flight deck; the CA briefed the DH (Deadhead) on the situation; he verified our assessment of the aircraft malfunction; and the CA asked him to back us up. Then; I read and accomplished the 700/800/900 Stabilizer Trim Inoperative Checklist (up to the Deferred Items section) while the CA and DH confirmed each step. Next; the CA transferred aircraft control to me; gave the flight attendants a briefing; coordinated with Dispatch; and solicited inputs regarding a potential divert from the other flight deck members. With the support of Dispatch and the cockpit; the CA elected to divert to ZZZ; notified ATC and Dispatch; [advised] ATC (due to a higher work load associated with manual trim requirements); and; coordinated for us to land on the longest available ZZZ Runway (XXR). Further along our route; the CA calculated our VREF15 approach/target speeds and Non-Normal landing distance; briefed the arrival and Flaps 15 landing; and; resumed PF duties. Shortly thereafter; we performed the Deferred Items checklist; flew an uneventful arrival; accomplished the landing checklist; and the CA executed a smooth FL 15 overweight landing. Afterwards; we taxied normally to the gate; shut down the aircraft; submitted maintenance write ups for the malfunctioning stabilizer trim and overweight landing; conducted a face-to-face briefing with Maintenance personnel; and completed the Parking and Termination checklists. A couple hours later; we flew the passengers on a different aircraft to their intended destination (ZZZ2) without incident.,Air Carrier Flight Crew Flying 737NG aircraft reported Stabilizer Trim malfunction inflight.

We were watching the #2 main tank quantity dropping rapidly. The #1 Main fuel tank read approximately 8;500 pounds and the #2 tank read approximately 7;600 pounds and dropping. As we diagnosed the issue in the climb; we shortly thereafter; received the Fuel Imbalance Alert. I flew and ran the radio with ATC while Captain ran the checklists. We [requested priority handling] and I coordinated with ATC for a level off and a return to ZZZ. We ran the Fuel Leak Engine Checklist in the QRH; and shut down the #2 engine per the checklist. We coordinated for [Runway] XXR due to the long runway; accomplished a brake energy calculation; and I transferred the aircraft control over to Captain; to fly the ILS. We taxied clear. The Emergency Crew verified we looked good; and we taxied to the gate uneventfully. I feel like all outside parties handled the event admirably. ATC was very helpful. We had a lot of Crew coordination going on; so we had to tell ATC to stand by with providing them with amplifying information about souls on board and fuel remaining. I should have just told them that info upon first declaring the emergency instead of waiting until all checklists were completed.Fuel imbalance over 1;000 pounds leading to diagnosing a fuel leak; accomplishing the checklists; and returning to ZZZ.,Air Carrier First Officer reported a possible fuel leak during climb; resulting in fuel imbalance. Flight crew returned to the departure airport and landed.

We were about to start our ZZZZZ arrival over ZZZ1. During our cruise systems check; we discovered the oil quantity indication on the ENG2 appeared to be lower than usual. ENG1;16 qt. ENG2; 6.5 qt. I decided to contact Dispatch for a Maintenance Control consultation. This communication with Dispatch was through SATCOM with a few failed attempts at least twice since we got the failure messages on the FMGC and the call dropping or a weak voice from the Dispatcher. I also tried through ZZZ1 Dispatch VHF XXX.X. When I did this; I accidentally tune the frequency on VHF 1 out from ZZZ Center; but flipped the ZZZ frequency back to it.When we finally got hold Maintenance Control through SATCOM; at that time the oil quantity was at 5.5 on ENG2. I explained our situation and concern with Maintenance Control and a possible engine leak and the trend of oil quantity; recommending to divert to ZZZ1 for a precautionary landing. At that present moment we had an ECAM advisory caution for ENG2 oil qty; 5 qt. Since Maintenance Control concurred with our plan for diverting to ZZZ1 we informed to ATC and continued our descent to divert. Another consideration to this decision was the marginal weather at ZZZ2; with light rain and low ceilings with a front coming into the area. The weather at ZZZ1 was VFR. The inflight and customers were briefed for the divert due to oil engine indication. We were vectored around for our sequence into ZZZ1; RNAV XXL. At this time; a priority was not declared yet.As we continued our descent at low power setting; the oil quantity ECAM advisory for ENG2 was still present and decreasing; 4.5qt. At that time; [priority handling was requested] and the inflight were briefed for a code yellow. We started the APU for systems redundancy. Once we were approximately 15 miles final and cleared for the RNAV XXL approach; our oil quantity for ENG2 was as low as 2qt at leveled off and temperature rising; I believe it was 138 C and increasing; if I remember correctly. It was evident; this was an oil engine leak and not an indication issue. Concerned about an engine damage and having an ECAM warning during short final a busy phase of flight; we performed a precautionary engine 2 shutdown; thrust lever 2 idle and engine master 2 off followed by completing the ECAM actions procedures. We continued the approach and the landing was uneventful. Once cleared of the runway; we briefly stopped at the taxiway for fire and rescue staff inspect the engine 2; if there was any visible damage. They discovered no damage but an apparent minor oil leak from the bottom of the engine. It took only a few minutes to asses this situation before we taxied to the gate. Upon arrival; we met with tech ops and gave them details of our situation. They commented that it was good we salvaged the engine; the oil leak was quite visible and evident once the cowlings were open. Finalizing my narrative; in spite of the circumstances; a rapid decreasing oil quantity on ENG2; [First Officer] and I did our best on bringing the airplane safely on the ground at ZZZ1 where the weather was favorable. It was an overwhelming situation trying to get hold of Dispatch or maintenance at the beginning due to the SATCOM connection issue and the time constraint. But at the end everything was accomplished safe and professional.However; in retrospect. I was really concentrated on getting the aircraft on the ground quickly once [priority handling was requested]. I would have emphasize on a potential precautionary engine shutdown during the approach briefing. It seemed that even though that my FO and I had a continuous dialogue and talking out aloud as we were descending to ZZZ1 we saw ourselves making a last minute decision for a precautionary engine shutdown. Perhaps doing the engine shutdown earlier would have gotten more time to review the contingencies for the flight. In-spite of how comfortable I feel flying the A320 this was a definitely a learning experience for me to manage my time accordingly.,A320 flight crew reported due an engine fuel leak they shut an engine down and diverted to the nearest suitable airport.

I called for the procedure for cracked windshield. I could feel the crack was on the inside pane with my fingernail. We donned our oxygen masks and started a descent down to reduce the differential pressure per the procedures. The Seat belt sign was on. The Flight attendants were informed of the issue and instructed to strap into their jump seats. I [requested priority handling]; informed ATC of the problem and was cleared to descend. Dispatch was advised via ACARS and a prudent decision was made to divert to ZZZ. I made a passenger announcement; briefly explaining the issue and our decision to divert to ZZZ for a Normal landing. We landed uneventfully. Dispatch and company were notified and a maintenance discrepancy was logged.,A320 Captain reported a cracked windshield during cruise resulted in a diversion.

I saw an amber flash on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) but didn't see what it was. I assumed it was the altimeter reminder to go to STD; but noticed we were below 18000 ft. As we approached 18000 ft. and went to standard; the 'AS DISAGREE' illuminated with approximately 8 kts. variance between my PFD and the First Officer's (FO). I continued to fly while I asked the FO to get out the checklist. We ran the QRC and followed up with the QRH and continued the climb while running the initial checklist. As we climbed; the disparity grew greater eventually close to 20 kts. At that point the engine instruments went to '-' s and I told ATC we were returning ZZZ. I briefed the Flight Attendants; Dispatch; ATC and the passengers. I opted to [request priority handling] so we wouldn't have to fly the STAR back in and because it would be an overweight landing. I got a bit task saturated on final. As we were configuring on final; we were gear down and flaps 25 by about 2;000 ft.; but I was late getting fully configured to flaps 30 at approximately 800 ft. due to talking to ATC about our intentions and ZZZ command procedures.It was a very benign event initially but got more intense as we were procedurally directed to turn off the autothrottles and as we continued to climb briefly. Then got distracted and slightly late configuring to final flaps below 1000 ft. In retrospect; I should have let the FO fly since he had the correct info displayed; instead of just making his flight director the master and using that.,B737-800 flight crew reported they received an Airspeed Disagree warning followed by other instruments failing so they returned to the departure airport and made an overweight landing.

The left flap indicated past 15 degrees and the right indicated below 15 degrees. The Captain initiated a go-around and directed me to [request priority handling]; I coordinated our go-around and intentions and the Captain (CA) transferred aircraft control. I flew the aircraft and continued radio coordination with ATC through holding; while the CA and International Relief Officer ran the checklist. The CA called Dispatch; Maintenance and informed the flight attendants with briefing information. I coordinated our exit from holding and approach clearance and transferred aircraft control back to the CA. The CA flew an uneventful approach and landing. Priority vehicles were standing by; and followed us to parking. We shut down with the flaps in their abnormal position. See attached photo of EICAS after shutdown.,B767 flight crew reported a flap malfunction on final approach.

The speed trim light on the overhead panel illuminated and extinguished. It was our jump seater who noticed the speed trim fail light as it extinguished before we could see it. After that the trim buttons on both Captain and First Officer control wheels where ineffective. Manual trim was still working and the master caution lit up again for the center fuel tanks. The speed trim light illuminated again at some point whilst troubleshooting and complying with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) procedures for speed trim fail and loss of electrical stab trim. The Captain was initially flying and then transferred controls to the First Officer. The First Officer was flying and communicating with ATC whilst the Captain communicated with Maintenance Control; Dispatch and Flight Attendants. We continued our climb to 15000 for terrain avoidance and stayed in communication with ATC/Departure advising them of our current condition and that we will be returning to ZZZ after completing our checklists and communications with maintenance and our Dispatcher.The Captain assisted by the jump seater started the QRH procedure for loss of electrical stab trim. We ended up climbing to FL210 as our communications became scratchy with Maintenance Control. The speed trim fail light did not stay on the entirety off the flight. We complied with the stabilizer trim inoperative QRH procedure and diverted back to ZZZ. During our communication with ATC we [requested handling priority] with our electrical trim failure and had the personnel on standby for our landing. We transferred controls back; the Captain (CA) started the descent to ZZZ as we were cleared and told to expect ILS to Runway XXL. The First Officer (FO); assisted by the jump seater completed the final items in the QRH and the CA landed the aircraft. After landing we continued to taxi clear of the runway to our assigned gate and made all the ELB entries for the speed trim light; electrical stab trim inoperative and overweight landing.,B737 First Officer reported loss of electric speed and stabilizer trim during climbout resulting in a return to the departure airport.

I was the Pilot Flying (PF). Climbing out of 7;000 ft. we experienced a loud bang; accompanied by severe shaking and vibrations. After a second bang; I looked at the engine indications and saw the right engine was surging severely. I suspected a compressor stall.  I immediately shallowed our climb; pulled the thrust lever to idle and the compressor stall went away with normal engine indications at idle. The Captain (CA) initiated a request for priority handling with ZZZ Approach; and we leveled off at 8;000 ft. We ran the ECAM procedure and pulled out the QRH for Engine Stall. We ran it and tried several times advancing the thrust lever; and the compressor stall returned every time. We left the thrust lever at idle; ran the single-engine approach procedures and told ATC we were diverting to ZZZ2. I continued being the PF and flew the ILS to [Runway] YYR. The landing was uneventful; and we exited the runway. As we began exiting the runway the engine auto-shutdown and displayed an Engine Stall ECAM. I transferred control to the Captain; ran the ECAM procedure; and we came to a stop. Airport Rescue & Firefighting checked over the aircraft and the right engine and saw no abnormal indications. We taxied to Gate XXX and disembarked the passengers as normal.No factors played a role in this from the flight crew. All indications and procedures were normal up to this point.No suggestions; this was a mechanical issue.,A320 flight crew reported compressor stall on takeoff with the right engine. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

The aircraft already was deferred with one R fire loop detector inoperative. With the second loop failure; we had no fire detection at all on the right engine. I continued to fly and assumed the radio responsibilities while the Captain first went through the non-normal checklist (there is no procedure for that malfunction) and then made the Satcom call to the Company Dispatch and Maintenance assets on the ground. The Relief Pilot made it up to the cockpit from his break and helped coordinate with the cabin crew. While the Captain was busy with the company; I began determining possible divert locations available to us in case that became a reality.After the Captain conferred with Maintenance and Dispatch; and then with myself and the Relief Pilot; we all agreed the most prudent thing to do was to divert to the nearest suitable airport. We determined ZZZZ was the airport most suitable. We considered ZZZZ1 and ZZZZ2. ZZZZ was the closest and had good weather. The Captain the [requested priority handling with] the Controllers. We were instructed to enter present position hold for fuel dumping and our clearance coordination to ZZZZ. We entered a present position hold and began dumping fuel to our max landing weight less burn to ZZZZ. We had XXX.X entering the hold and at the start of dumping which happened pretty much simultaneously. We dumped down to 93 thousand and landed at approximately 553 thousand under maximum landing weight. The arrival and landing into ZZZZ was uneventful.,B777 flight crew reported both right engine fire detection loops failed so they diverted to the nearest airport.

We noted in Operations during briefing that there had been a write-up regarding an EICAS message - 'C Hyd Dem'. We discussed it briefly and noted that we would watch for any abnormalities.On takeoff; at gear retraction; we all noticed an increased odd noise from under the aircraft and also an unusual slight vibration. We did get a similar EICAS msg that illuminated briefly; but gear and flap retraction seemed normal. Enroute portion of the flight was normal.During the approach into ZZZZ; as flaps were extended; they came out normally to Flaps 1; but we heard a slightly unusual noise. As Flaps 5 were selected; a flaps EICAS appeared; followed very shortly afterwards by a Hyd EICAS message; C Hyd Press. At this point; the Captain as pilot monitoring (PM) selected the status page and we saw C Hyd quantity dropping through about 50% and dropped within a few seconds to zero.We broke off the approach and asked for a place to go to work the issue. We were given a climb and a hold at ZZZZ1. Once safely climbing and then established in Holding; the Captain and I referenced the QRH for C Hyd Press and the First Officer (FO) acted as pilot flying (PF). We elected to get the flaps out to 5 right away via the alternate system. We then reviewed the remainder of the checklist noting the need to extend flaps and gear via alternate system; and that; depending on the results of follow-on steps; may not have steering and require a tow to the gate. As Relief Pilot; I made the initial contact with the Flight Attendants (no Prep); the Captain coordinated with ATC for a long final and the possibility of stopping on the runway. ATC inquired about a [priority handling request] and the Captain confirmed that we were.We left holding and went to Flaps 20 shortly afterwards during vectors to intercept the ILS; then put the gear down at approximately 12 miles. It was clear below about 4000 and wind was calm. ATC did a great job with comfortable vectors and accommodating our requests. FO did a great approach and landing; stopping was not an issue. However; upon taking control of the aircraft and attempting to clear the runway; the Captain determined that steering was not available. We stopped on the runway for about 10-15 minutes while Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) looked over the airplane and we waited for the tow.Tow to the gate; parking; and termination were normal. However; we did wait a while for buses for the Passengers; and the Captain debrief with local maintenance and Police took some time.Overall; I thought it was a good real-world execution of how we are trained to handle non-normal situations. The Captain exercised overall command and authority; the FO did a great job as PF handling the aircraft; and as the Relief Pilot; I worked the checklist with the Captain (PM) and made inputs and assisted where able.,B767 First Officer reported C hydraulic system failure resulted in special handling to landing with tow to gate.

I transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer and started the low oil quantity QRH procedure. This led us into the engine low oil pressure QRH. We did not yet meet the criteria to perform an intentional shutdown because the oil pressure was not in the red yet. I contacted dispatch via the crew phone app and had them patch me to maintenance to consult on the issue. While on the phone the oil pressure began to drop in and out of the red. We then discontinued the call to complete the QRH for engine shutdown. While on the phone dispatch did advise that ZZZ1 and ZZZ2 were the two closest airports and provided the weather at each. The weather at the time was rain in ZZZ2 and clear in ZZZ1 so I advised dispatch we would be proceeding to ZZZ1. We completed the QRH for engine shutdown and then advised ATC of the [urgent] condition. While I was on the phone with dispatch the First Officer and advised ATC we may have to divert and that we had the oil issue. He had also already looked at our single engine altitude. We requested FL220 and descended. ATC cleared us direct to ZZZ1. In the descent; I completed the QRH for one engine inoperative landing and the Non-Routine Landing Considerations. I advised both the cabin crew and the passengers we would be making a precautionary landing in ZZZ1. I then took the flight controls back from the First Officer.We continued to ZZZ1 and requested vectors to the ILS XX. We conducted the ILS in VFR conditions to a landing without incident. Safety vehicles inspected the aircraft on the runway and escorted us to the gate. Once at the gate we contacted Dispatch and maintenance to advise them of our status. No significant factors other than a loss of oil. No suggestions for the event however coordination of the deadhead flights for the crew was a bit scattered. Just better coordination between the Chief Pilots and scheduling on the status of the crew. In addition I was given almost this exact scenario on my Line Operating Experience (LOE) for my type ride as a Captain and that experience was very helpful in this event.,An Air Carrier Captain reported loss of oil pressure in one engine caused them to shut down the engine and divert to a nearby airport.

Shortly after; I assumed control of the aircraft and radios; while the Captain started QRH procedures for Engine low quantity.During the QRH process; I informed ZZZ Center of an impending engine shut down due to loss of oil pressure and will keep ATC advised; I also used the FMC to calculate an engine out drift down altitude of 22;000 ft. The Captain then reached out to Maintenance Control for guidance as the current aircraft conditions did not meet QRH procedures for a precautionary shut down. During this time; Captain has asked me to start looking for a diversion airfield; I referenced Jeppesen charts for suitable fields and after asking ATC for help in obtaining the current weather and runway in use; I elected ZZZZ as the prime candidate since it also had medical and company presence. Shortly after; we resumed QRH procedures as the oil pressure indications continued to drop from amber to red; resulting in an inflight shutdown. The Captain and I agreed ZZZZ was the best suitable; and after coordination with dispatch; the captain [requested priority handling] and we changed routing to ZZZZ. ATC cleared us to descend to 22;000 ft. initially and I trimmed the aircraft for the descent and slowed the aircraft to 280 kts. to give us additional time to complete all checklists; I also set up the approach in the FMC while the Captain addressed the cabin crew of the issue and informed the passengers of the diversion.After the Captain finished his tasks; I informed him of the speed; and trim setting and transferred control of the aircraft to him; we also briefed the approach (flap override; higher descent rate; go-around considerations etc.) As the aircraft descended lower; I called the cabin crew to check if all is fully seated; cooled the cabin further and briefed them on ETA and flight conditions.Upon contacting ZZZZ Approach/ATC; we were given a different approach and unfavorable vectors; we requested the ILS XX and informed them our intentions of widened and delayed turns. The aircraft was stable on the path outside the FAF and landed with a full stop on the Runway. While the Captain addressed the passengers over the PA; I informed ATC to let emergency vehicles approach and inspect right side of the aircraft. After we received the thumbs up from Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) ground personnel; we taxied the aircraft to the gate and deplaned the passengers. After approval from the Chief Pilot; we returned to the flight deck and assisted ground personnel in towing the aircraft off the gate; to parking it at an Apron and shut it down completely. I was well rested for the sequence and was alert; the Captain was great in directing and keeping everyone informed. The flight deck and cabin crew had excellent CRM leading to the safe outcome of the flight. QRH dictates to verify Oil pressure to drop below red line before proceeding to inflight shut-down; the time it takes can delay decision making. I believe pilots should be able to monitor and proceed with pre-cautionary shutdown before red line is reached.,B737 First Officer reported loss of engine oil pressure requiring inflight shutdown and diversion.

USED/FOB DISAGREE. Using the non-normal philosophy; it led us to the appropriate QRH procedure. We assessed the situation by monitoring fuel burn; fuel balance; FOB change; fuel over waypoint; etc. Inflight crew did a visual out the side windows and did not notice anything related to a fuel leak near the wings or engines. Captain called Dispatch/Maintenance Control to discuss. FOB seemed to be decreasing at an abnormal rate. We decided to return back to origin with alternative airports as options if needed. At this point; through the conversations that were had; there was some confusion as to if this was an actual fuel leak. With both wing tanks being balanced and maintaining balance through center tank transferring along with some raised doubting questions in regards to it being an indicator problem instead of fuel leak. This led us to not further the QRH procedure past the step of being a confirmed fuel leak. We continued to origin airport. Below 10;000 ft. we started slowing to 210 kts. and while engines were at idle; there was a yawing motion with some vibration followed by an ENG 1 FAIL message. We completed ECAM action items; [requested priority handling]; briefed inflight crew on briefing items for our situation; and briefed the passengers. After landing; Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) assessed our engine and with no fire risk; we continued to the gate. Airport Operations was advised to make aware to Maintenance Control of the engine failure.,A321 flight crew reported fuel issue followed by engine failure inflight.

I was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the Captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). It was a rainy night with now Post-Tropical Storm pushing through the area. Upon reaching roughly 400-500 ft.; just before we were getting ready to make the right turn on the ZZZZZ SID; we heard multiple load bangs come from the #2 Engine. These bangs were accompanied with fluctuating engine parameters on #2 and a loss of power. This happened a few more times as we were analyzing the situation. Shortly after; we received the ENG 2 STALL ECAM; to which we followed and brought ENG 2 to Idle. Once at Idle; the ENG 2 parameters were normal and we had no indication of fire or damage. We didn't see or hear any birds hitting the aircraft; so we didn't believe we ingested anything into ENG 2. Since we had no idea why ENG 2 stalled; we wanted to get on the ground ASAP due to fear of ENG 1 stalling as well. After we completed the ECAM; we immediately begun our return to ZZZ. The Captain and I delegated duties prior to running the ECAM; and I continued as pilot flying and took over the radios; while the Captain first worked the ECAM; and then began to prepare for our return to ZZZ. We requested an immediate return to ZZZ and [requested priority handling]. We climbed to 3;000 ft. and received vectors back to Runway XX at ZZZ which we had loaded into the Secondary Flight Plan.The Captain was in communication with the Flight Attendants and made them aware of the situation. They actually called us as the stall was happening. The Captain gave them the briefing and prepared them for our return. The Captain made a PA to the passengers to advise them of what happened and that we were returning to ZZZ. The Captain loaded the new flight plan back to ZZZ; sent for landing numbers; and coordinated our return with operations. While heading back to ZZZ; the Flight Attendants called again advising us that a passenger had passed out. We relayed this information to ATC and made sure paramedics would be waiting at the gate. Since we had no reason to believe there was any fire or damage; we elected to taxi off the runway and to the gate upon landing in ZZZ. ATC cleared all traffic out of our way and vectored us back to Runway XX in ZZZ. We were just under Max Landing Weight for the A321. After a successful landing on Runway XX; we taxied to the gate. Once off the runway; we communicated with Operations to make sure everything was ready for us and paramedics were standing by; which they were. Once we were able to get the passenger who passed out medical attention; we deplaned under normal procedures. From takeoff to landing; we were back on the ground in 16 minutes.,A321 air carrier flight crew reported engine stall on climbout. The flight crew returned to departure airport; landed; and taxied to the gate where passengers deplaned.

The Flight Attendants notified us they heard a banging sound coming from the right side of the aircraft. The right engine slowly returned to match the left engine but fluctuated +/- 2% N1. We made the decision to divert to ZZZ after being notified about the noise heard from the cabin. On the descent the right engine was slow to respond with thrust changes. We made the decision to request priority handling and landed at ZZZ on Runway XXC flaps 40. On landing using thrust reversers the right engine again responded slowly and had a slight change in asymmetry. Roll-out was uneventful and the safety vehicles followed us to the Gate. Using everyone from the First Officer; cabin crew; ATC and the Company; the flight diverted successfully to ZZZ uneventful. I credit CRM training which led to a successful outcome of the event.,B737-800 flight crew reported while climbing to FL360; the right engine N1 spooled back approximately 40%. The flight attendants notified us they heard a banging sound coming from the right side of the aircraft. The right engine slowly returned to match the left engine but fluctuated +/- 2% N1. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

PF (Pilot Flying) performed go-around. During go-around we got RA from aircraft departing Runway 24L. ATC was aware and issued us right turn to 270 to increase separation. PF got a bit task saturated so I announced 'my controls' and executed turn and climb leveling off at 5;000 ft. Completed all checklists and returned to land on Runway 24R. Once we leveled off and things calmed down I elected to transfer controls so the original PF could complete landing. Next approach and landing happened without event.,B737NG Captain reported executing a go-around on approach to LAX after encountering wake turbulence from the preceding aircraft.

QRH procedures were followed to an engine shutdown with a subsequent divert to ZZZ.At the time we were going by ZZZ off to our left and could see the field clearly. The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF) and I the pilot not flying (PNF). We confirmed the problem to make sure we were doing the correct checklist and I immediately [requested priority handling] with ATC and we descended to the engine out altitude for the aircraft. In the descent we went through the Engine LOW PRESSURE checklist. This directed us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist which was run next. After confirming the checklist was appropriate I completed the checklist to step 15 where it directed to go on to the one engine inoperative landing checklist.At this time and also during the checklist I kept cross checking with the FO and contacted dispatch to confirm ZZZ was a good divert field. The FO kept flying and descending to ZZZ. I briefed the Flight Attendants with the briefing and told them to plan for a normal landing. Dispatch ensured that emergency equipment would be available. I made a PA to inform the passengers that we had an engine problem and had to shut it down and would be landing in ZZZ. ATC gave us about 5-10 minutes of delay vectors as I went through the checklists.The One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist was completed to deferred items where the FO and I came together again to brief the ILS approach to XR. The deferred items were completed and when we were ready the FO flew a nice single engine approach and landing to XR. We cleared the runway and had emergency vehicles go over the plane for any possible hot brakes or fire and then taxied to the gate.Things that could have gone better:During the descent when I was running the checklist we passed FL180 and the FO made the call for altimeters set. I set the altimeters but did not turn on the landing lights. It was such a nice night and ZZZ airport and XR was so bright it didn't even occur to me until the landing roll that they were off. It was a mistake on my part and the workload I was under at the time contributed to the mistake.I also did not give a lot of consideration to the fact that we were going to land at max structural weight or over by a few hundred pounds. I should have briefed the FO that we would be. He made a nice landing and Maintenance asked me after the flight to add in that we made a normal landing in the Maintenance write up. I was more concerned about getting the aircraft on the ground safely since we had shut down an engine.,B737 Captain reported low oil pressure indication led to engine shutdown and divert.

The Captain requested the trucks to meet us on landing. The Captain then informed company; Flight Attendants (FAs) and passengers. On return to ZZZ; we prepared for an overweight landing of 135;000 lbs. On approach we experienced an uncommanded roll left/right at 2;500 ft. [with the] autopilot on. On touchdown the 'Takeoff Config' light illuminated. After thorough inspection by Airport Rescue and Firefighting we got the green light ('All Safe') and continued taxing to the gate.,B737-700 First Officer reported '...2 events of aileron roll resistance left/right followed by an excessive bank...'.

At FL410 and Mach .79 at approximately XA45 a noticeable bang was heard followed by yaw; vibration; and N1 rollback on #2 engine. Within 5 seconds the immediate action items for Eng Fire/Severe Damage (vibration) was completed and within approximately 7 seconds a shallow descent (500 FPM) was initiated by the pilot flying (PF). At this time the pilot not flying (PNF) [requested priority handling] with ATC and coordinated a descent to 24;000 ft. direct ZZZ. The PNF then ran the QRC/QRH checklist for Eng Fire/Severe Damage (read-and-do with proper crew coordinated.) No fire warn/indicator lights illuminated; T-Handel pulled no bottles blown. The EGT gauge on #2 engine illuminated red but I never noticed and temp higher than low-mid 800s. This (EGT) eventually extinguished (completely cooled by approximately 10000 ft.); N1/N2 never completely stopped rotation throughout the remainder of the flight; never seized.The PF continued to follow ATC vectors and altitudes in a large box pattern E and N of ZZZ at 250 kts. while the PNF coordinated with ATC (Crash/Fire Rescue; Intentions to land XXL (XXR closed); full stop on the runway); flight attendants (Brief); passenger notification; and finished up all appropriate checklists; and normal operating checklists as applicable. The Captain took over PF duties at 3;000 ft. on a vector to intercept for the visual approach Runway XXL (w/ ILS backup) at approximately 13 DME. The PF made a flawless flaps 15; auto brake 3; app/landing. A full stop on the runway was performed and Crash Fire Rescue quickly met the aircraft and determined no immediate threat present. Passengers and Flight Attendants were kept informed throughout the event. Crash/Fire Rescue followed the aircraft to the gate and passengers were deplaned. Post inspection by both pilots reveled a normal N1 section with a completely destroyed turbine section. ATC; Crash/Fire Rescue; Operations/Maintenance; and Flight Attendants performed exceptionally.,B737 flight crew reported a '...yaw; vibration; and N1 rollback on #2 engine;' resulting in a diversion to the nearest suitable airport.

The AFT OVERHEAD PANEL flap extension indication lights also remained extinguished. Captain (pilot monitoring (PM)) and First Officer (FO) (pilot flying (PF)) discussed this situation and initially assumed it was a faulty gauge; but both gave the flap malfunction section of the QRH a quick review before and during initial descent into ZZZ. Electronic Logbook entry was sent to Maintenance; and a note to ZZZ station ops was sent requesting to have Maintenance meet us on arrival.Normal briefs were conducted and Descent Checklist was completed prior to top of descent.After switching to ZZZ Final Approach Controller; crew was cleared to ZZZZZ for the ILS XXL approach.Over ZZZZZ at 8000 ft.; PF called for FLAPS 1 and PM moved the flap handle to FLAPS 1 position; but both flap position indicators displayed FLAPS 0 without any LE FLAP TRANSIT light illumination. The flaps were stuck at 0.Captain (PM) [requested priority handling] with ATC; had FO (PF) continue flying; and told FO to handle the comms while Captain found; and started running the FLAPS- TRAILING EDGE FLAP DISAGREE checklist. FO worked with ATC to fly to and hold south of ZZZ1 VOR. Captain noted that Fuel On Board was 6200# and; knowing that running flap malfunction checklists can be complex; decided to get started with finding the correct checklist prior to FO entering the ATC assigned holding pattern. Captain was reading QRH checklist titles and unaware that FO was struggling to properly enter the assigned holding pattern into the FMC; and only discovered it after hearing a TCAS TA and the Approach Controller called to tell us to get back into our holding pattern (There was NO TCAS Resolution Advisory). Captain took a look at the holding pattern depicted on the Navigation Display (ND); saw that FO was reloading a correct pattern into FMC; then FO returned aircraft to holding fix and continued flying the aircraft in the holding pattern.The TE FLAP DISAGREE checklist was completed which directed us to the ALTERNATE FLAP EXTENSION checklist. This checklist was completed while we were in the holding pattern and prior to heading back to ZZZ for landing.Flight attendants were briefed (no prep for evacuation was ordered); and passengers were informed about our flap malfunction prior to final approach.Captain elected to fly the approach and landing. FO requested Tower to roll the firefighting trucks for our landing.Uneventful FLAPS 15 landing; and taxi to the gate with firefighting equipment in trail. At the gate; Fire fighters reported that our brakes were warm; but no fire threat existed. Passengers deplaned normally; and crew debriefed Maintenance Technician at the gate.,B737 flight crew reported flap malfunction resulted in priority handling to a safe landing.

We pushed off the Gate on time and had a normal flight operation until about FL250 when we received a caution message on the ECAM 'HYD: G Rsvr lo LVL; G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR; G SYS LO PR'. A decision was made to stop climb at FL270 and to remain on course for the time being to assess the situation. We complied with the ECAM procedure and also the QRH. After further assessment of the situation I transferred the controls to the First Officer so I could advise the company; flight attendants; and also the passengers. I then called the Dispatcher via SATCOM and asked to be connected as well to Maintenance. I explained the situation and we jointly; in the interest of safety; made the decision to return back to ZZZ. Referencing the QRH we had a sufficient stopping margin to safely land overweight on Runway XXL in ZZZ. Once that decision was made I then called the inflight crew to advise them of the diversion and explained that this will be a code yellow. Information given was that we had lost our green hydraulic system and will be on the ground back in ZZZ in about 25 minutes. After speaking to the flight attendants; I then made a PA to the passengers to advise them of the situation and what to expect. Once that was all complete both the First Officer and I came up with our 'game plan' for returning to ZZZ. We then requested priority handling and advised ATC of our hydraulic failure. Per SOP we completed the overweight landing QRH and also referenced the diversion guide material. The HYD G RSVR LO LVL QRH lead us into the alternate gear extension which we accomplished successfully. After we landed and exited the Runway I stopped the aircraft on Taxiway 1 and set the parking brake. I requested crash and rescue for an inspection of the aircraft for any indication of hot spots; excessive brake temperatures; or smoke before we proceed to the Gate. I made a PA to the passengers not to be alarmed by emergency vehicles around the aircraft as it's a normal procedure after an event like this. Once at the Gate; the parking brake was set and the parking checklist was completed. During the parking checklist; the First Officer and I could smell hydraulic fluid in the flight deck. Once Maintenance came on board and asked about the event we explained to him what happened; and he verified that there was little hydraulic fluid left in the reservoir. A post flight walk around was performed to confirm if any visible hydraulic fluid was coming from the aircraft. During our inspection we observed hydraulic fluid leaking from the back of the number 1 engine; under the belly of the aircraft; and also pooling of fluid on the Ramp as well. After the event; operations advised us of a tail swap to take our customer to ZZZ1. The First Officer and I made a self assessment of fitness to continue and with coordination with crew services determined we were legal. The subsequent flight was complicated uneventfully and landed safely at the destination 'ZZZ1' approximately 3 hrs behind schedule without further issue.,A321 Captain reported normal flight operations until about FL250 when we received caution messages on the ECAM HYD G RSVR LO LVL; G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR; G SYS LO PR. The flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

It was yawing to the left. I could feel resistance on the peddles and I thought it may have been the Captain's feet. I found out later it was not him. Right after bringing the gear up on takeoff; we got an ECAM caution message about the nose wheel steering. I can't remember the exact message. I called 'my aircraft' and focused on flying and radios while the Captain ran the checklists. We determined that the nose wheel steering was INOP. But we didn't know the position of the gear; whether straight or at a 90 degree angle. We wouldn't know until we lowered the gear. Either way; we made the decision to request priority handling and make a full stop landing in ZZZ. We requested ARFF be waiting for us. The Captain made the appropriate calls to Dispatch and Maintenance. He alerted the Flight Attendants and made the PAs to the passengers. I requested priority handling with ATC and gave them the requested information. It was a very short flight so things were moving fast. We decided to get the gear out early to see if there were any additional ECAM messages. Thankfully; there were not. We determined the nose gear was straight and that we would make a normal landing to a full stop on XXL in ZZZ. We touched down and came to a stop without incident. Crash; Fire; and Rescue was standing by. They inspected the aircraft for damage and found none. We handed them the gear pins and a push crew towed us to the Gate.,A320 First Officer reported on the takeoff roll they noticed it was difficult to keep the aircraft on center line. The flight crew elected to continue to destination airport; requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing.

ZZZ-ZZZ1. During approach to XXL at 8;000 ft.; cleared for the approach with the APPR psb armed (right around ZZZZZ); we received an ECAM for Engine 2 EGT over limit. Looking at the EGT; we had both recognized that it was in the red over 800*C. Captain commanded ECAM actions to which I had began running. It had us reduce engine 2 thrust to idle to reduce EGT which caused no change and required us to shutdown engine 2. The ECAM elected us to select engine 2 master off. Captain increased engine 1 thrust lever to MCT. Systems pages showed; to which we went through each to see what systems were effected; followed by reading the status page. Eng anti ice went on and the APU was started. After ECAM actions were complete a request for priority handling was made to ATC and a hold was requested over ZZZZZ1 at our current altitude of 8;000 ft. by Captain as I went into COM 2 to run the procedures for ENG 2 EGT over limit and ENG 2 shutdown. Getting set up in the hold at ZZZZZ1 at some point our altitude became uncaptured putting us in v/s mode. We had been -250 originally and +250 during the first turn before getting the airplane to capture 8000 ft. on the outbound leg. While I was running the COM Captain called the lead Flight Attendant to give a brief; sent an ACARS message to Dispatch; contacted ZZZ1 ops; took ATC commands and requested emergency vehicles to stand by for landing. The COM instructed for the cross bleed switch to be in the open position if performance permitted. I should have kept this in auto due to high terrain for the possibility of a go-around. After the COM was complete I had taken over ATC communication and requested our approach for the ILS XXL. As we started the approach I told the passengers we would have them on the ground in approximately 5 minutes and to remain seated with seat belts fastened. Upon landing; 'spoilers' 'reverse green' and 'decel' were called. '70 kts.' was called. Upon coming to a stop simultaneously I informed ATC we were stopping on the Runway while Captain set the parking brake and called for 'flight attendant stations'. The firetrucks did an inspection to which nothing abnormal was found. Captain announced 'remain seated remain seated remain seated'. I then asked ATC for taxi instructions back to the Gate. Emergency vehicles followed us to the Gate. Once parked and the jet bridge pulled up we were met by a Firefighter and Maintenance to which a logbook entry was made and phone calls made to both dispatch and a Chief Pilot.,A320 First Officer reported receiving an ECAM for Engine 2 EGT over limit. A go-around was performed and the flight crew ran the QRH and check lists. Priority handling was requested; the affected engine was shut down and a precautionary landing was performed at destination airport.

We advised them that it's not uncommon to get odors on the initial climb out and asked them to let a couple minutes pass. They called back climbing through 31;000 ft. with another report of the return of the strong burning rubber odor. At that point we advised ATC of the situation and [requested priority handling]. ATC provided additional services for our visual approach into [Runway] XXR. On the ground fire rescue evaluated the exterior condition and found no anomalies. We were met at the gate by fire and rescue to verify there was no on going fire risk. Within 15 minutes of landing we had the passengers deplane normally. We provided the accounts of the situation to maintenance of the reported odor and overweight landing. We both felt we were able to continue with the day and did so with no other events with a new aircraft.,B737-800 First Officer reported a fumes event during climb. After evaluating the situation the flight requested priority handling to the departure airport where a safe landing was completed and an aircraft swap was assigned.

The flight attendants also informed us that they were detecting an odor in the cabin. We spoke to Dispatch and decided to return to ZZZ. We [requested priority handling]; completed checklists. The flight attendants found the source of the toxic odor. It was a 32 ounce bottle labeled Monomar that spilled in a passengers bag in the overhead bin. We returned to ZZZ and completed an overweight landing. Our intention was to taxi to a gate; however we were instructed to taxi to the penalty box. We deplaned the passengers and the FO (Flight Officer) and flight attendants were taken to the hospital for observation and released.The cause was a 32 ounce bottle of toxic chemical was allowed to board the aircraft.Make sure TSA checks passenger luggage.,B737-800 Captain reported the flight attendants notified the flightdeck of an odor in the cabin during cruise. The flight crew requested priority handling to the departure airport where a safe landing was completed.

After a short time; they notified us that they found the source and we're trying to clean it up; but passengers and crew were not feeling well. We [requested priority handling]; diverted back to ZZZ; and completed the checklists. We conducted an overweight landing and deplaned the passengers at the penalty box. No passengers were injured so they and the Captain were taken to the terminal and the rest of the crew went to the hospital. Cause: A passenger brought a substance that is not allowed in an amount onto the airplane. TSA did not find it during screening.,Air Carrier First Officer reported being notified by a Flight Attendant of an odor caused by an unknown substance in the cabin. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

The aircraft immediately started to shake and the engine initially seized and then began to surge. [Priority Handling] was declared we received vectors from air traffic control and asked for an immediate return to the airport. Ran QRC checklist and then made an overweight landing. No indication of fire; however the engine produced intermittent power. Initially we were cleared for XXC however due to aircraft's control ability we were not able to make the turn ATC then offered XYC to which we excepted a clearance for landing. In process of landing XYC we did encounter an RA which was flown successfully while also maintaining visual separation.,Air Carrier Flight Crew flying B737 aircraft reported bird ingestion into number one engine on takeoff rotation.

The write up had been checked and signed off so I noted the issue but felt since it had been signed off that it was safe to fly. We then departed for ZZZ2 with no issues during departure. During cruise approximately 1:30 into the flight; I noticed a 500 pound imbalance in the left wing from the right wing while still using center tank fuel. We discussed the possibility of a fuel leak since a similar write up had been made on the plane the night before. We had received a 'using reserve fuel' on the FMC and the left side wing tank had 8.12 versus the right side of 8.52. The center tank had approximately 1.1-1.4 and since we were still using center tank fuel we knew that the left side should not have been reduced at that point. We talked with the Flight Attendants and had them inspect the wing for any fuel that could be coming out of the wing or engine spar. They reported that nothing appeared to be coming out of the wing. We then contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and felt it was best to divert to ZZZ. After beginning to divert we used the remaining center tank fuel at which point the left wing fuel began to drastically drop (approximately 400 pounds in about 5 minutes). At this point we decided to run the fuel leak checklist which recommended that we shut down the engine. We did that and requested priority handling. We then ran the appropriate engine out checklists and proceeded to land in ZZZ with no further incident.,Flight Crew reported a fuel imbalance that increased in flight. The Flight Crew ran the checklists and QRH. An in flight shut down of the left engine was accomplished and a request for priority handling was made. The Flight Crew elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

[Two other diversion options] had storms and ZZZ was clear with no wind. We coordinated with Dispatch and talked to the Flight Attendants of what to expect. We also assured the passengers that everything was going to be ok. [We requested assistance from] ATC and landed safely in ZZZ. We deplaned the passengers and connection plans were made.,B737 NG Captain reported diverting to an alternate airport after inflight shutdown of #1 engine.

It increased in frequency and duration. The Captain initiated a Sat phone call to Dispatch and Maintenance Control. While this call was occurring the light became more frequent and persistent. As we were only about one hour from ZZZ with many souls on board; we made the prudent decision out of an abundance of caution to return to ZZZ versus continuing on further away from a safe landing spot. A priority report was made to ZZZ1 (ZZZ Center) and clearance was received to return to ZZZ. We began to dump fuel as to not exceed our maximum landing weight. Checklist were run and we briefed the Flight Attendants; announcements were made to the passengers and contingencies discussed. Arrival; approach and landing were normal. We were met by the fire department upon clearing the Runway; the right engine was shut down and inspected by the fire personnel for any noticeable damage; there was none. As we had been directed to an awkward position on the Taxiway for the fire crews to inspect the engine; we were unable to taxi the aircraft to the Gate and we required a tug to tow us to the Gate. Passengers were disembarked and Maintenance personnel entered the flight deck to ascertain the nature of the problem.,First Officer reported approximately 45 minutes after takeoff at cruise altitude; observing the right engine fire warning light begin to flicker on. The flight crew performed an air turn back; dumped fuel and made a precautionary landing at departure airport.

MSL on departure from ZZZ Runway XX. Abrupt bang; aircraft yaw; EGT boxed red; no N2 rotation. Negative fire. Captain was hand-flying the aircraft. We leveled at 2000 ft. MSL. Flaps were still set at 5; we kept flaps at 5. Since I knew we'd make a box pattern to land back at ZZZ; we flew the engine out departure procedure. We switched from Tower frequency to Departure. We [requested priority handling]; initiated the QRC; followed by the QRH; until completion. Turned crosswind; then downwind with ATC. We ran diversion items on normal checklist card. We notified Flight Attendants and Dispatch; and we briefed Passengers. We then initiated the Landing Checklist; as directed by the QRH; obtained landing performance data for one engine inoperative; flaps 15 landing; briefed the visual approach (backed up by the ILS XX); turned base and final. Captain flew the flap 15 approach to landing.We were cleared to Runway XX at G; turned right on R and held for inspection by the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Crew. We asked ARFF to check for damage to engine; airframe; and landing gear. Re-briefed Flight Attendants and Passengers on ARFF activity. ARFF noted a slight fluid leak but no observed damage. I asked ARFF for a brake temperature reading. They recorded hottest brake at 303 F. We ran brake cooling separately; through the performance data. Data came back at 70 minute hold; off gate time. Called Maintenance; relayed brake cooling data from the ARFF Crew; Maintenance Control waived the 70 minute cooling time. ARFF Crew gave clearance to taxi; briefed Flight Attendants and Passengers; proceeded to Gate. At the gate; we spoke with Dispatch; Maintenance Control; the Operations Center Chief Pilot; ZZZ Assistant Chief Pilot; local ZZZ Maintenance; Union rep; and Scheduling. Great support from all. Excellent job by my First Officer and Flight Attendants. Great Crew effort.,B737-800 flight crew reported engine failure during climbout resulting in a return to the departure airport.

Approximately halfway between ZZZ and ZZZ1; we were advised; by the Flight Attendant; that the forward lav was leaking sewage onto the floor. Sewage then began seeping into the flight deck from under the second jump seat. The First Officers bag was damaged with the sewage spill. Brown sewage was also leaking into the flight deck area behind the center pedestal. We continued into ZZZ1 for an uneventful landing. Maintenance was notified and a logbook entry was made. ZZZ1 Maintenance removed the toilet seat cover to find a leaking line that they were unable to repair. The forward lavatory was locked and deferred per MEL XX-X-XX Lavatory Not Used. About halfway into our next flight; ZZZ1 to ZZZ2; the sewage reappeared in the same areas. The Flight Attendant then called to say the lav smelled horrible and that the aircraft was unsafe to continue on. I agreed and sent a Maintenance Message informing ZZZ2 Maintenance of the issue. We landed safely in ZZZ2 and assumed the aircraft would be grounded. I contacted Maintenance through Dispatch; to tell them the Supervisor on Duty should put in a swap. I met local Maintenance and advised them of a puddle of sewage on the flight deck. I told them it was unsafe for use and they agreed saying; 'We'll take it to the hangar.' Walking to my car; I was contacted on my personal phone by Scheduling; saying I had to call Maintenance Control. I then called Maintenance Control and was told with an attitude that 'I just can't ground an aircraft and walk away; and where's the write-up?' I then replied 'hold on a second;' to which the Controller responded; 'NO YOU HOLD ON A SECOND!'I then told him that I would walk back across the street to write it up. However; it was now on a deferral and had flown around for two days without being repaired; while creating an unsafe environment for passengers and crew. He then said; 'What do you want in the logbook?'; to which I replied 'aircraft unsafe for use due to forward lavatory leaking sewage into flight deck area and Flight Attendants report forward lavatory excessive sewage smell' He then hung up. I simply didn't see the need for additional logbook write-ups when Maintenance was literally standing in a pool of sewage in the flight deck. Apparently the previous deferral didn't work. However; the Maintenance Controller was apparently unhappy with me for not re-entering the deferral??? I have never received a personal phone call; while off duty; or been treated so disrespectful; by another employee in my over XX years at this Company. The pressure and coercion to keep aircraft in service is a severe Safety issue to our passengers and crew. The Maintenance Controller should be removed from duty and retrained. Personally contacting a Captain to tell him he can't ground an aircraft without a logbook entry; is promoting a hostile; unsafe work environment. I exercised my Captains authority to provide a safe; hospitable environment for my passengers and crew; by grounding the aircraft. My First Officer and I both returned home from our trips with sewage-laden bags. My bag was subsequently left in the sewage when my First Officer pulled his bag out. The Flight Attendant was required to serve drinks out of a galley adjacent to this lavatory for two flights; thanks to our Maintenance Operation's incompetence. I wrote it up and was in compliance with our MEL procedures. I then followed up to Dispatch and Maintenance Control; only to be met with attitude and told you can't do that. The Company should issue vouchers to the passengers affected on this flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. The Company should offer to replace the First Officer's and Captain's luggage and issue a stipend for belongings damaged.,B737-700 flight crew reported lavatory leaking into cabin and cockpit area.

Shortly after reaching cruise atlitude at FL360 the Captain and I noticed an order which could be described as burning plastic or electrical in nature. The Captain called the flight attendants to ask if they had something in the oven (that may be burning) but they did not; and at the same time the aft flight attendants called about the same smell. We later found out the entire cabin could smell the odor almost simultaneously. I took the aircraft and ATC communications while the Captain accomplished the procedures to address the problem. After accomplishing the checklist the odor had gone away. We considered our options and due to the unknown source of the smell we elected to divert. The nearest suitable field was deemed to be ZZZZ1. The Captain continued coordination with the cabin crew and dispatch while I [advised] ATC and requested vectors to ZZZZ1. The descent and arrival to ZZZZ1 were unremarkable. Emergency vehicles were present and followed the aircraft to the hardstand since there were no abnormal indications in the aircraft requiring immediate assistance. Passengers deplaned uneventfully. No known cause; Maintenance is inspecting the aircraft for the source of the odor.Prevent any odor from filling the aircraft that is from an unknown source.,Air Carrier First Officer reported a fume event during cruise. After completing the appropriate procedures the Captain requested priority handling to a suitable airport where a safe landing was completed.

I was flying and working on ATC instructions so Person A; my FO (First Officer); answered the call. He told me that the FAs had encountered a smoking lithium battery pack and had soaked it and it appeared to be no longer smoking. I looked at our position and saw ZZZ2 at my 11 o'clock and 20 miles; ZZZ3 at my 10 o'clock and 50 miles and ZZZ1 at my 12 o'clock and 50 miles. I told him to [request priority handling] and get direct to ZZZ1 and lower. We were given 10;000 ft and a heading of XXX. Passing 14;000 [ft.] I asked Person A to call in the back and check on the smoldering electronic device. The F/A said it had stopped smoking and it had been placed in the over head. We asked that it be put in the 'Fire Containment Bag' and secured for our landing in ZZZ1. 30 miles from ZZZ1 we were given pilots discretion to 2;000 ft. At about 18 miles from we asked for direct ZZZZZ (a fix X.X miles from the airport on the Runway XXL localizer). We called the airport 'insight' and as we were passing 3;000 feet we were told we were leaving class B airspace. We were cleared for the visual approach to Runway XXL. We were expediting our flight to ZZZ1 and slowing to 200 kts at this point was not in the best interest of the safety of flight so we maintained 250 knots until approximately 10 miles from the airport and configured for our flaps full landing. I asked Person A if he would contact rescue 1; after we land; to coordinate with them and how they wanted to take possession of the fire containment bag (at the gate before or after passengers deplaning or before). They said they wanted to come on the aircraft prior to passenger deplaning and take possession of the fire containment bag. I also asked Person A to ask the flight attendants about possible smoke in the cabin after landing. As long as we did not have smoke in the cabin we were going to taxi to the gate. We landed and we did not have smoke in the cabin and rescue 1 would follow us to the gate and collect our fire containment bag. I made an announcement similar to a medical emergency and asked that all passengers remain seated and allow some emergency personnel to enter the aircraft. I would make an announcement when the passengers could deplane. We were escorted to [the] Gate and parked. The firemen collected the fire containment bag and the passengers deplaned without incident. I spoke with the Fire Chief; Station Manager; Dispatch and then my Chief Pilot.,A321 Captain reported being notified by a Flight Attendant of a passenger's smoldering Lithium Ion battery pack during descent. The battery pack was placed in a Thermal Containment Bag while the flight crew was provided priority handling to the destination where a safe landing was executed.

As we were climbing up we asked for level off and stopped at 12K ft. I stated my aircraft. Then we got the secondary indication of AUTO Flight A/THR Off. And proceeded with initial ECAM procedures. I got aircraft set up for manual TCL levers and 12K ft. and handed aircraft to FO and stated his aircraft and radios and I would continue with the ECAM Procedures Follow up. We asked ATC to turn us back to ZZZ for a maintenance issue. We went through procedures and finished up the procedures. Also notified FA's [of the] precautionary landing and to prepare for landing; then notified Passengers about a return to ZZZ to have a maintenance issue checked out. I took the controls back and requested priority handling with Center they promptly sent us back to ZZZ Approach and continued with issue; fuel onboard; and SOB's; and we requested ARFF to stand by. I asked FO to set us up for the approach and brief it. I notified Dispatch via ACARS. We then ran through the Precautionary Checklist and the Overweight Landing Checklist. We set up for 27L ILS. We monitored engine the entire time. The AUTO Flight A/THR ECAM went away and AT started to work again on downwind prior to turn to base. Ceiling was at 600 BKN and about 3 miles visibility. Landed overweight by 500 lbs. at 172.2 and had shallow rate of descent and normal to soft landing. Landed and rolled out uneventfully. Taxied off to Taxiway XX and stopped for ARFF to inspect engines and brakes. Brakes were about 465 and turned brake fan on and they proceeded to reduce temp. Received a gate assignment while holding and notified Maintenance. Then headed to gate uneventful with ARFF following. Upon shutdown and checklist completion; we heard from ARFF that they smelled a foul smell from #2 Eng and could smell once the airplane door was opened.,A321 flight crew reported two engine EICAS messages illuminated during departure climb. Flight crew completed the appropriate QRH procedures; requested priority handling to departure airport where a safe landing was executed.

Ran QRH and notified Maintenance Control and Dispatch. Everything else was normal at that time. Maintenance Control notified Maintenance. Later in flight had Loss of System B. Ran QRH and notified Maintenance Control and Dispatch. We ran performance calculations and brake cooling for ZZZ1 XXL. Discussed situation of continuing to ZZZ1 with Dispatch. We were all in agreement of continuing to ZZZ1 (Dispatch; Maintenance Control; Supervisor and us). Notified ATC of our situation and [requested priority]. Notified Flight Attendants and Passengers of the situation. On descent we had another issue. The #1 engine low hydraulic pressure light came on. The A System pressure and quantity fluctuated a little and then stabilized at normal pressure and quantities. Ran QRH and notified Maintenance Control and Dispatch. Requested voice contact with Dispatch over ZZZ1 and discussed concerns with System A. Continued to ZZZ1; finished QRH for Loss of system B and landed on Runway XXL. Captain did the landing. Cleared the runway and taxied to remote area. Contacted ARFF while they monitored the aircraft. Ran brake cooling numbers again and had 18 minute hold out. Was notified of fluid coming out of number 2 engine. Shut number two engine down and was towed to Gate. Made required logbook writeups and discussed situation with ZZZ1 Maintenance. Then contacted Dispatch; Supervisor and Chief Pilot for debrief.,B737-800 Air carrier Captain reported low hydraulic pressure in cruise and during descent on both engines. Flight crew continued to destination and landed.

We [requested priority handling] and requested to stop climb at 3;000 ft. and return to ZZZ. The FO (First Officer) was flying and talking to ATC. The Relief Pilot and I ran the EEC L non normal check list. Then contacted ZZZ Operations to relay our return to Dispatch. We proceeded downwind and continued to run the Non-routine and overweight landing checklists. We decided to land overweight after reviewing the secondary engine instruments which showed nothing abnormal. The FO landed the Aircraft at 604;700 lbs on the longest runway with both engines operating ; max reverse thrust was used til 60 kts. We exited the runway at the end and held in a holding area prior to the taxiway. We then asked emergency personnel to look at our left engine for any sign of damage or fire. They informed us all clear. We waited for ZZZ Maintenance to arrive with the tug and inspect our brakes; tires and engine prior to being towed to a hard stand. The FO did a fantastic job flying and communicating with ATC; the landing was smooth and no issues with brake temp or tires. The Relief Pilot was an unbelievable asset during this time; communicating and running checklists as well as monitoring the CA (Captain) and FO. Excellent job!,Air Carrier flight crew reported multiple left engine malfunctions during takeoff. Flight crew performed an air turn back to departure airport where a safe landing was completed and maintenance was provided.

I was pilot flying (PF). As we were approaching our cruise altitude of FL 370 a caution light illuminated which had the Captain and I staring up at the ENG 2 LOW PRESSURE light. The Captain ran the QRH which just directed HYD PUMP switch (affected side) OFF. The B System Pressure remained in the normal range and the hydraulic quantity held at 106%; so we decided to continue to the original destination. Dispatch was notified through ACARS of the situation. 90 minutes later; story time was interrupted by the illumination of ELEC 1 LOW PRESSURE light and I noticed the Hydraulic B quantity dropped rapidly to 0%. The Captain then ran the LOSS OF SYSTEM B QRH. A discussion was had regarding if the situation required a diversion to a longer runway. After being notified; Dispatch ran Stopping Performance numbers; which still resulted in positive numbers; and a now required 30 minutes of brake cool down off the gate. A request for priority handling was made at this point. Twenty minutes after loss of System B; the ENG 1 LOW PRESSURE light illuminated (now the A side is acting up). QRH directed the affected switch be turned off. Realizing that communication via ACARS was hindering our ability to share a mental model with Dispatch and the collection of required data; in a timely manner; I requested a nearby Ops Station to patch our flight through to Dispatch. The Captain conversed with ZZZ while I handled COMM 1. The remaining ELEC 2 pump was providing adequate reduced flow pressure and the A Hydraulic System retained its quantity.Dispatch ran Runway performance numbers for Loss of System A and B; just in case; which still yielded positive stopping performance. After considering the advantages of using the HUD for the approach; the Captain and I switched flying roles (I was now pilot monitoring). We ran the deferred items for the LOSS OF SYSTEM B and received vectors for a long final approach for a flaps 15 landing. A good landing was made; and after the Captain exited the runway; we taxied to a spot to wait out our brake cool down; all the while being monitored by the local Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) who were surrounding the aircraft. While allowing the brakes to cool; several of our Company aircraft reported that fluid was leaking from the underside of Engine 2 (The ARFF Crew was concerned that it may be fuel.). The Captain then directed me to shut Engine 2 off. In the non-normal state that we then found ourselves; we elected to get towed into the gate.,First Officer reported the loss of both B Hydraulic System Pumps led to the loss of the B Hydraulic System. The flight crew continued to destination airport and made a safe landing.

As we taxied past; we noticed there was a large amount of fluid pooled on the taxiway underneath the right engine. We would come to learn that this aircraft had a loss of Hydraulic System B. The next morning; we reported for our flight at ZZZ1. When we began our preflight duties; Maintenance Personnel came and retrieved the logbook stating there were write ups that needed to be reviewed. We continued boarding the aircraft; got to our scheduled departure time and the logbook had not yet been returned. While we were discussing this; the Captain noticed and brought to my attention that the 'Flap Inhibit' switch was toggled active. We had figured at that point that this aircraft was likely the same aircraft we saw the day prior. Approximately 10 minutes after our scheduled departure time; the logbook was returned; reviewed; and the appropriate checklists completed. We discussed with the Maintenance Personnel that the # 2 engine driven hydraulic pump had been replaced overnight and a ground run had been performed. We departed the gate shortly after this. There were no anomalies on the engine start; taxi; or warmup period. After the takeoff sequence; as the pilot flying (PF); I called for the landing gear to be selected up. While the landing gear retracted; there was a momentary Master Caution light and I saw HYD illuminated on the recall panel. It lasted for less than one second. The hydraulic indications were all normal. During the climbout; we discussed that during the ground run; the landing gear would not have been cycled and that this may have caused the momentary Master Caution/HYD light.We continued the climb and approximately 15-20 minutes into the flight (abeam ZZZ2); the Master Caution light illuminated again with a Low Pressure light illuminated on the ENG 2 HYD Pump. We ran the QRH procedure; which had us place that pump in the OFF position. The quantities and pressures were both still normal at that point. We discussed our options and contacted Dispatch. We felt that continuing to destination was the best course of action. We spent the next 30 minutes or so discussing different scenarios about system failures; reviewing the QRH procedures; etc. I would like to point out that the Captain was very knowledgeable with the systems and it was a great learning experience as I have about 270 hours in type. During this discussion; we noticed that the Hydraulic System A was now indicating 78%. When we departed it was >90%. I wrote down the quantity and time on the ATIS sheet so that we could track the fluid level. Over the next 20 minutes or so; we determined that we had a slow leak of about 2% every eight to nine minutes. I calculated that we would land in ZZZ3 with about 55 to 60% fluid quantity in System A. While we were discussing the now escalating situation; the Hydraulic System B fluid quantity went from 106% to 0% in about 30 seconds. We now had a complete loss of System B with what we believed to be a slow leak in System A. We immediately decided to [request priority handling]; notified Center and requested immediate descent and vectors to ZZZ. We ran the loss of System B QRH procedure; walked through an Approach Brief discussing the nuances of our failed systems and how we would configure. I flew the aircraft and talked to ATC while the Captain coordinated with Dispatch; the Cabin Crew; and ran the QRH. The approach and landing were uneventful.,B737-800 flight crew reported the failure of the #2 EDP in flight with the subsequent loss of both main hydraulic systems resulting in a diversion.

We executed a go-around and requested vectors from ATC; explained the nature of the problem and [requested priority handling] shortly thereafter. The slats appeared to extend fully but the flaps were stuck between positions 1 and 2.We reviewed and briefed the F/CTL FLAPS LOCKED non-normals checklist; advised the flight attendants and passengers of our situation and sent a quick note to Dispatch.We asked ATC for the current winds at ZZZ which were favorable for Runway XY and requested vectors to the new runway. We also requested to have emergency equipment standing by.We briefed and executed the new approach followed by an uneventful landing and taxied to the gate without further incident.,Air Carrier flight crew flying A319 aircraft reported Flap Control system malfunction on final approach.

Before 10000 ft. FA (Flight Attendant) called flight deck; also indicating a very strong fume in the entire cabin. Dirty sock/burning plastic-like smell. [We requested priority handling]. We donned oxygen masks in the flight deck and proceeded to return to field. Leaking oil seal in an engine suspected. Fumes never dissipated despite operating procedure. [I suggest a] maintenance tracking program of problematic aircraft.,A319 Captain reported a 'dirty socks/burning plastic' odor permeated the cabin during climb-out and the flight returned to the departure airport.

We had fault lights illuminated on the GEN ENG 1 and PTU (Power Transfer Unit) switch. We ran the ECAM which directed us to switch both the GRN ENG 1 and PTU off. The status page listed all the inoperative systems. It also stated that we should attempt to restore GRN ENG 1 to extend the gear and if unable a gravity extension would be required. We then referenced the FM non-normals for review; reviewed the gravity extension and computed the landing distance required. The Captain [advised] Center and requested direct ZZZ. We had XXX [passengers and crew] and around 1:45 minutes of [fuel]. Next the Captain made contact with my Dispatcher through ARINC. He explained the situation and his intentions to land at ZZZ1. We set the aircraft up for a 20 nm final; turned the GRN ENG 1 pump back on and selected gear down. The gear extension was slower than normal but we did receive a 3 GREEN and locked indication. The GRN ENG 1 was switched back off. We touched down in the first 1000 ft. of XXL and came to a stop with 1500 ft. remaining. We ran an after landing flow; then referenced the FM Supplementary section for Tow-in procedures. After shutting down the engines the Fire department informed us we were leaking hydraulic fluid out of the nose wheel area. End of incident; the Captain notified all required authorities.,A320 Air carrier First Officer aircraft reported Hydraulic System Malfunction on descent.

While cruising at FL320; one or two of the Flight Attendants called the Captain on the intercom to report a strong odor/fume in the aft cabin area. At least two of the three Flight Attendants also reported being light-headed and having headaches as a result of said fume. Therefore; the Captain decided to divert to the nearest suitable airport in the area. Given that we had to land as quickly as possible; we could not waste time (fume onboard) to burn fuel for a landing below max landing weight. Although we were heavy at the time of the fume event; we had to get on the ground safely as quickly as possible. The Captain had me [request priority handling to a suitable airport] as we prepared for an overweight landing. The approach and landing were executed by the Captain without incident. Based on anecdotal references from other crew members; the A320 seems to have more fume events than any other fleet type at Company A. I would like to see a joint effort between Airbus and Company A in working out a permanent fix for the recurring issue of smoke/odor/fumes onboard A320 jets.,A319 First Officer reported a fumes event during cruise. The flight crew diverted to a suitable airport where a safe landing was executed and Maintenance was requested.

Cabin altitude was at 10;000 feet and climbing. We donned our oxygen masks and established communications then asked ATC for 10;000 feet. I ran the QRH while [name] flew the aircraft. I [requested priority handling] and we were cleared to FL240 and then later to 10;000 feet. Based on our proximity to the departure airport and inability to control cabin altitude; and because we were now at too low an altitude to reach company; We agreed to return to ZZZ.Cause - Found that aft Lav cap not secured.,B737-300 Captain reported the loss of cabin pressurization during climb. Flight crew requested a lower altitude and priority handling to departure airport where a safe landing was completed.

All pre-flight activities; the ZZZ1-ZZZ2 leg and ZZZ2 turn were normal. Our ZZZ2-ZZZ3 leg was a dry-ice exemption flight and we followed all pre-flight procedures.Approximately 1+00 into the flight; approximately 250 NM East of ZZZ; FL370; my Dragger Alarm activated. After discussing the indications with the First Officer; and the fact that her Dragger remained silent; we considered deploying the 3rd Dragger Monitor from the Overhead Cabinet. Shortly after leaving her seat; the FO (First Officer) reported an odor in the aft cabin/galley area and feeling hypoxia-like symptoms. I also recognized symptoms similar to hypoxia. She returned to her seat and we immediately donned our O2 Masks. I remember feeling extremely lightheaded and dizzy as I donned my mask and we both agreed we had been feeling unrecognized physiological symptoms prior to the Alarm.Once we established communications; the FO and I quickly discussed our Physiological States; the Dragger Alarm and the presence of an odor in the cockpit. We quickly proceeded to the Smoke/Fumes/Fire Elimination checklists in the QRH. As I was already the Pilot Flying; I elected to have the FO remain the PM (Pilot Flying) and run the QRH while I communicated with ATC. We both agreed to coordinate a diversion with ATC. We elected a 180 turn to ZZZ for a straight in approach to Runway XXR. I coordinated an expedited descent; ATC clearing us to minimum step-down altitudes available due to the terrain below us. The FO quickly but methodically worked through the Smoke-Fumes-CO2 QRH checklists; keeping me apprised as she moved through the steps. However; the Dragger Alarm continued despite QRH actions so we elected to focus on preparing for an immediate landing in ZZZ. We continued with our diversion procedures and initially intended to Auto-Land Runway XXR. However the ILS ultimately wasn't available so we elected for a visual approach rather than change runways in close. We also discussed our post landing plan. Not knowing the true nature of our situation (toxic fumes; excessive CO2 or possibly both) we elected to stop straight ahead on the runway and prepare for a possible evacuation.The approach; landing and roll out were expeditious but standard and uneventful. Once setting the parking brake and running the applicable portions of the Evacuation Checklist; we elected to open our windows before removing our masks. That way if there was a toxic fume event/inability to breathe normally we would have the windows available for evacuation. We did not consider the Crew Entrance Door an immediate option as we were unsure of the atmospheric conditions behind us. As soon as we opened our windows the Dragger alarm ceased and we did not smell or note any abnormal fumes or other issues. We felt it more prudent to continue to assess the situation rather than immediately evacuate. We worked with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) for a cabin inspection and egress via normal means. CFR reported high levels of CO2 but no toxic fumes. Once cleared to the crew entrance door and aided by CFR; we exited the aircraft.Post-flight; we were both evaluated on scene and then ultimately elected to go to a local area hospital. Diagnostic tests did not indicate any exposure to toxic substances or other lasting physiological effects. However; after describing the event/physiological symptoms to the on-call physician; she believed that we were likely exposed to a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide. Unfortunately there was no medical test available with which to confirm her diagnoses.,Air carrier First Officer reported a fume event during cruise was identified by the CO2 alarm activating. The flight crew diverted to an alternate airport where a safe landing was completed.

I was given command of the aircraft and radios while the Captain communicated with dispatch via the Application. We were instructed to have FA's seek medical assistance. After a short period we were advised by the Flight Attendants that 3 of 5 oxygen bottles failed to operate and that the passenger would not have enough oxygen to make it the remainder of the flight. During this time the passenger was being attended by a physician on board. The passengers situation was improving but then quickly deteriorated. At this time; the physician on board communicates that we need to divert; and quickly. The Captain informed Operations Control and Dispatch and the mutual decision to divert is made. ZZZ is agreed upon and I was instructed by the Captain to [request priority handling] and divert to ZZZ. We maintained maximum safe forward speed and got on the ground as safely and practically as possible. Due to our load; we anticipated an overweight landing. While I managed the flying; the radios and coordinated with ground personnel; the Captain accomplished the applicable checklists. Upon completion of the checklists and briefing the controls were transferred to the Captain and he made the landing and then taxied to the gate. The passenger was removed via paramedics; and we communicated with dispatch and maintenance.Although its not known if the passenger would have made it to ZZZ1 with all O2 bottle operational; it limited time and diversion options. Unfortunately a medical diversion is unpredictable. I commend the crew for handling the situation as professionally and expeditiously as possible regardless of the challenges encountered and adapting.,B737-800 First Officer reported a medical emergency inflight.

The shimmy progressively got worse and a few seconds prior to rotation we heard a single knock. We lifted off normally and retracted the landing gear. The retraction was slightly louder and the spin down of the nose wheel was longer than normal. Eventually the noise ceased when the wheel rotation stopped. The climb and cruise was normal. About halfway through our flight to ZZZ1; we were told by ZZZ Center that the Tower in ZZZ reported they found tire debris on the runway after our departure. We discussed the situation with each other and based on the events from take-off we felt we probably had damage to the tire. We discussed our options and reviewed our manual; which had guidance for failed tire on take-off and landing with a flat tire. We both agreed our safest option was to divert to ZZZ2.It provided us with a longer runway option as well as maintenance and operations availability. We notified ATC and [requested priority handling] with a diversion to ZZZ2. We then notified Dispatch; the Flight Attendants; and passengers. We reviewed the landing procedures in the manual and briefed the landing. The landing was normal and we were able to maintain directional control. We stopped on the runway and vehicles approached to inspect the damage. They said the left nose wheel was missing the outer tread but was still inflated. The right nose wheel had no damage. We agreed we could taxi to the gate safely. Maintenance met us at the gate and the aircraft was taken out of service. We were given a new aircraft and we completed the flight to ZZZ1 2 hours delayed. No injuries occurred on the flight.,B737-700 flight crew reported nose gear tire damage after takeoff.

Went through options with the FO (First Officer) and we agreed to continue on to ZZZ after contacting Dispatch. [Requested priority handling] with Center and proceeded to a point on final for Runway XXC. FO completed the uneventful landing; FO was very experienced and I was comfortable with him landing aircraft. [Priority] personnel checked the aircraft on taxiway and then we proceeded to the gate with trucks following. While at cruise; I decided to bring the Purser up to brief her on the situation and brief the situation. We did not prep the cabin; but just had them review steps for evacuation so they were fresh in memory. I had plenty of time to bring her to the cockpit for the brief. I had an immediate situation with a young crew before and they came off the plane shaking; so if there is time I now try to look them in eye and let them see I am calm. I think this worked well with our situation.,Captain reported loss of Yellow Hydraulic System during cruise. The flight crew continued to destination airport and landed.

[Requested priority handling] with ATC due to an overweight landing condition and requested ARFF. We accomplished the 'Landing Gear will Not Retract' checklist followed by the 'Non-Routine Landing' checklist and the 'Overweight Landing' checklists in the QRH. A normal landing was made and taxied back to the gate.,B737-800 pilot reported landing gear would not retract after take off. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

She also informed us that another Flight Attendant was smelling and feeling the same thing. The Captain asked if they could swap places with the aft Flight Attendants to confirm what was happening. They did and confirmed what FA said. After a brief discussion it was best to divert back to ZZZ due to having better medical care; longer runways for an overweight landing; and better services for the passengers. We began the process of coordinating with ATC for a clearance and [requested priority handling] due to having incapacitated crew members. The QRC and QRH procedures were completed and we also descended to 10;000 ft. in case we would need to turn off both packs. Not long after we began the return; we were informed that the FA was being administered oxygen. Only the right pack was turned off. After a few minutes; the FA reported feeling better; but then later the symptoms returned and oxygen was administered again. We prepared for our arrival in to ZZZ. Things were uneventful other that a little more communication regarding the [event] and Operations.Once at the gate; emergency personnel boarded the aircraft and assessed the FA. They took her in to the terminal and then we began deplaning the passengers. Maintenance logs were filled out. Phone calls were made to the union; the Duty Officer; crew scheduling; and others. We decided to all be checked medically. All the Flight Attendants were transported by ambulance. The Captain drove me to the hospital where I was checked. Afterwards; I talked with scheduling about a hotel and what would happen next. I went to the hotel and got to my room around XA:00am.I did not recognize the event as one that required the use of a QRC or QRH procedure. It was only after we began to divert back to ZZZ that the Captain began to do the QRC. This delay possibly led to increased exposure to the fumes; but reduced the total time of the incident.In an incident like this; I think it would be most appropriate to isolate the crew from passengers. This would allow assessment to be completed more timely; and reduce the possibility of social media exposure. It would also allow crew members to make all the phone calls necessary to report the incident. The number of phone calls required to be made by the Captain was enormous. Having one incident response phone call would considerably reduce the stress of the situation and allow a more timely medical assessment of crew members. There was only one person performing assessments; and when the passengers saw that crew members were being assessed and wheeled out on gurneys; they became more agitated about what they could have been exposed to and requested assessment. I did my best to alleviate the work load of the Captain; but there was only so much I could do.Also; it can be daunting for a person to be in an unfamiliar city while experiencing a situation like this. It would be best to keep crew members together as best as possible; at least in the same hospital.One of the biggest recommendations I can make is to get rid of an outside contractor in coordinating medical care in emergency cases. The process was difficult; unnecessary; and extremely frustrating. I had people calling me during required rest times. I found out after I got home that they had not considered me cleared to travel until the case was closed (after I had deadheaded to ZZZ1; stayed the night; deadheaded to ZZZ2; and commuted home). Outside contractors are not familiar with our operation and did not work in my best interest.,Air Carrier Flight Crew reported being notified by a Flight Attendant of a 'smelly odor' in the cabin. The Flight Crew requested priority handling to a suitable alternate where a safe landing was executed and medical evaluation was provided to crew members.

Condition were IFR with light to moderate Rain and visibility of 2/1/2 mile at the surface. Pilot flying (PF) was First Officer (FO); and I was the pilot monitoring (PM). We were given a descent clearance to be followed by a base turn to final. While descending on the downwind; FO stated that the aircraft was making an uncommanded turn. With his hands on the control the Autopilot disengaged. FO struggle to regain control indicating strong control force and a pitch down trim force. Concern was a possible runaway trim. I immediately deployed the trim wheel handle and began to trim airplane aft according to FO instruction. My only concern at the time was flying the airplane and regaining control. The only indication I remember up to this point was the red Autopilot annunciator illuminated. ATC called several time to issue turn instruction. We did not respond; due to the urgency of aircraft control. After regaining control; there were concerns about the trim as express by the FO. I decided to eliminate confusion and cutoff the stab trim switches. I informed the FO that switches were cutoff and that we were now manual trim. I then responded to ATC and [requested priority handling]. ATC acknowledged the request and requested the standard passenger count and fuel onboard. I want to land ASAP; now that we had control under what seemed to be manual reversion. The FO was doing a great job turn and descending. We were able to turn and descent to 4;000 ft. and establish ourselves on final. There was much dialog and sense of urgency in our communication in the flight deck. I wanted to land immediately; since time was a factor and weather was not in our favor. As we started to configure with flaps; we attempted to extend the gear. The gear did not extend. At this point it became an approach to landing would not be feasible. I requested a straight out miss and maintaining 4;000 ft. ATC granted that request and shortly thereafter gave us a climb to 8;000 ft. and a turn to the east. At this point; we got busy in a hurry. FO wanted to clean up the flaps. This made sense as first and then I reconsidered. Valuable time was being wasted trying to climb and configure; I also did not see any advantage to clean up with a hydraulic issue. I did not want to lose the use of flaps and then complicate issue more. This was discussed between the FO and I. We agreed not to clean up completely. We left the flaps a 1; the indicator stop a 5. I instructed ATC that we were going to stop the climb at 5;000 ft. They gave us clearance to maintain 5;000 ft. This helped us focus on the gear problem. At this point; I also decided to bring the jump seat pilot into helping us. I instructed him to plug in a headset. Up to this point; everything was just happening too fast and I needed to slow things down and get the gear down. I opened the QRH and started the Manual gear extension checklist. I had the Jump Seat Pilot extend the gear since he had great access to these handles. Right gear was dropped first; this caused a yaw to the right and a pitch down attitude. More manual trim required. Then nose and left gear. This stabilized the yaw. At this point; I was ready to come back for the approach and advised ATC. They started to give us headings back to ILS XXC. I ask the FO is he was OK; or needed a break. He informed me that he was good to continue pilot flying. I then instructed the Jump Seater to monitor FO and keep him focus and talk to him and the same time; I instructed FO to keep the turns to no more than 10 degrees. I advised ATC; that we need a shallow intercept to final. I notice that HYD B system was at 60 percent and brake pressure just above 2;500 PSI. I coordinated with the FO and we agreed that he would only fly the plane. I had the Thrust Levers and the trim. We settled on a speed of 170 kts. for approach. Again; Flap handle was at 1 while indicator was at 5. We broke out at 400 ft. AGL with runway in sight and light showers. Once landing was assured; I set the power to idle. FO needed back trim to arrest the sink rate. I trim back aggressively. We landed and max brake was applied. Control was exchanged and I was able to turn off slowly clearing the runway. We were towed to our gate.Time; Weather and operating in a terminal area under IFR condition with no Autopilot.,B737-800 Captain reported loss of autopilot and hydraulic system failure caused controllability issues in flight. The flight crew performed a go around; regained aircraft control and landed at destination airport.

He also smelled it. We then noticed that it smelled like dirty socks. The Captain directed me to send a message to Dispatch so they could plan for Maintenance due to a fume event while he checked with the Flight Attendants. The A Flight Attendant also smelled the odor. We continued the descent and the smell grew stronger. I stated that my head was hurting and I felt nauseated. The Captain also was noticing weird symptoms so he called for us to don the oxygen masks and run the procedure for smoke/fire/fumes. While I was accomplishing the checklist; the Captain flew the airplane and handled radio communications and [requested priority handling to destination]. We flew the RNAV approach due to a NOTAM for the ILS and IMC. Upon landing; we taxied to the gate and shutdown the engines and opened the windows before removing the oxygen masks. We got the passengers off quickly. The A Flight Attendant admitted that she threw up and had a sore throat. I also felt unwell. While walking to the hotel van; all 3 Flight Attendants said they felt odd and dizzy with headaches. I also had the same symptoms. We all discussed going to the ER but the Pilots and Flight Attendants were scheduled for 2 different hotels. I exchanged numbers with them and told them to call if they continued to worsen or needed medical care. After getting to the hotel; I continued to feel dizzy; have a headache; and felt like my coordination and concentration was taking more energy than usual. I went to the nearest ER within 1 hour of the event. The Flight Attendant text me and said she vomited 2 times and felt very sick but that she and the other flight attendants were not going to the ER because they 'can't afford the sick points; and our union said we'd get penalized and have to fight to remove the points.' I received blood work; fluids; and O2 for 4.5 hours at the ER. I removed myself from the trip and still felt unwell for 48 hours. The A Flight Attendant worked the next day but sought medical attention after her trip ended due to lingering effects.Find and fix the issues causing fume events and don't allow employees to be penalized or fear reprisal for seeking medical assistance/ being pressured to fly unwell.,A320 First Officer reported a dirty socks odor during descend. The Flight crew requested priority handling to destination where a safe landing was completed. Crew experienced physiological symptoms.

The flight crew identified the malfunction and continued to fly the aircraft to Runway XX. During those final moments before touchdown; the Pilot Flying was able to slowly reduce thrust on #2 engine; thereby minimizing the continuation of the compressor stall. The landing was uneventful. Upon clearing the runway; the assigned gate was not available; at which time the crew parked in hold bay X. Prior to shutting down the #2 engine in the hold bay; the flight crew noted a 100 degree C. difference between the #2 engine and the #1 engine; with the #2 engine being higher. Upon parking at gate; Dispatch; Maintenance; Supervisor and Chief Pilot on call were notified of the event.,B737-700 Captain reported a compressor stall on final approach. The flight crew continued the approach to landing; monitoring the engine for any further issues.

The event happen around XA59z in cruise. The ECAM reported a (HYD G RSVR LO LVL / HYD G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR / HYD G SYS LO PR). We ran the ECAM action and the COM2; and recognized that we would have to lower the landing gear via a gravity extension. At this point I knew we had commuter that was headed to ZZZ1. Since I was doing IOE with the First Officer; I thought it would be better to have more input on the situation especially from an Instructor. I notified the Flight Attendants; the Company and [requested priority handling] and continued to ZZZ1. I requested a longer then normal approach to final for the flight control and the gravity gear extension. Landed the airplane on Runway XXR from the ILS; came to a complete stop on the Runway ran the emergency procedures with fire and rescue. I taxied to the Gate with no incident after land and park checklist completed. I reserve the right to amend this report as additional information becomes available to me.,Captain reported loss of the Green Hydraulic System in cruise. The flight crew continued to destination airport and landed.

Immediately after rotation we felt it hit the plane and #2 engine started to vibrate. We continued the climb. Told ATC what happened; [requested priority]; and prepared for a return to ZZZ. We leveled off at 3000 ft. All engine indications on #2 were normal except for the vibration. It was at 7.0. We kept the engine running. We did the overweight checklist; got landing performance data and discussed that if we had to do a go around; it would be the engine failure procedure profile; just in case. We briefed the flight attendants and passengers and made an uneventful landing on Runway XXR. After fire rescue personnel determined that engine 2 was not smoking; we taxied back to the gate.,A320 Air Carrier Flight Crew reported bird strike during takeoff.

The flight started normally and we were not rushed for time as our previous flight from ZZZ2 arrived on time. After we had pushed and started a southeast taxi; we noticed that the autothrottles somehow became disconnected. We reengaged the AT (Autothrottles) only to have them come off once again after about 10 seconds. At this point we had left the ramp and were taxiing south on [Taxiway] XX. We started the number one engine and after the number one engine was started and stabilized; the AT stayed on and we had no further issues with it. We did have a contingency brief on what our plan was should it disconnect on our takeoff roll; but it stayed on for the remainder of our flight till my FO (First Officer) disconnected them for landing. My FO was the pilot flying and after a normal takeoff from Runway XX; I was finishing up our after takeoff checklist when I started to smell a burning smell of some sort in the flight deck while climbing through approximately 1;000 ft. AGL. I confirmed this with my First Officer; who said he smelt the same burning smell; during our debrief he would later tell me he also had slight irritation in his eyes around the time we noticed the fumes. We performed our memory items for smoke and fumes followed by running the QRC items for smoke and fumes. My First Officer was the flying pilot so I handed ATC comms to my FO while I checked in with our flight attendants. I advised them of the situation and asked if they had anything in the galley ovens that might be burning. We were told that there was no food cooking in the galley oven but they would check for any residual food. My FO and I had a brief short discussion about the AT disconnecting a few times while taxiing out southeast and wondered if it might be related to that. The AT continued to work fine so I then continued on with the checklist for smoke and fumes and directed our FAs (Flight Attendant) to turn on and off various cabin lights per the checklist. After confirming no remaining food in the ovens that could be burning; our aft FAs did confirm a burning smell of some sort; while our forward galley FAs confirmed no strong smell but they did smell something on takeoff but thought it was fumes from prior departing aircraft. Since the burning smell was still present and we could not identify where the fumes were originating from; we decided to return to ZZZ.My FO continued to handle the PF (Pilot Flying) duties as well as ATC comms; while I sent a quick message to Dispatch and ran through the briefing with our Lead Flight Attendant. Afterwards; I continued further in the checklist as far as I could; both packs off below 10;000 ft. at this point in the smoke and fumes removal checklist; until I decided that time was of the essence and I could not continue any further as we were being vectored back for Runway XXC; the runway we requested as we had just landed on it a few hours prior. After loading the FMC for a return to field; responding to Dispatch via ACARS; and a quick brief for [Runway] XXC; I then made an announcement to our passengers about the issue and our return to ZZZ. We finished our descent checklist to make sure we didn't miss any items and after discussing the overweight landing situation; I decided it was best to allow my FO to continue flying as he felt comfortable with the situation and we made an uneventful landing in ZZZ. We were overweight but I don't exactly recall the number other than it was by about 4000 lb. We cleared [Runway] XXC and talked to Airport Rescue and Firefighting who verified there was no visible smoke and fumes before taxiing back to our gate uneventfully.,B737 Flight Crew reported a fume event of unknown source during initial climb. The Flight crew completed appropriate QRH procedures and performed an air turn back.

During Cruse flight preparing for the descent I gave control to Captain to do Approach Briefing. Doing that at FL370 Master Caution came on and ENG 2 FADEC SYS FAULT and ENG 2 SYSTEM FAULT ECAM messages as well. Captain called for ECAM actions and they were performed. With ENG 2 in IDLE aircraft started to slow down. A Descend to FL240 was requested to ATC and they denied it due to traffic. Captain requested to get off from Airway to perform drift down as aircraft was slowing down. FL340 was given but we needed to decent more. Then Captain requested priority handling and explained ATC what was going on in order to get to lower altitude and we were cleared direct to ZZZ. Around 5 minutes later ECAM messages disappeared and engine parameters were checked. We decided to use engine 2 back as Eng 2 parameter were continuously checked. ATC was notified that we had that engine back. COM 2 was checked for more actions to do. I took aircraft control and we briefed for plan of action in case we had more problem with Eng 2. I landed aircraft without any problems. During taxi ENG 2 TURB COOL FAULT ECAM message appeared. Eng 2 was shutdown after 3 minutes and message went away. Maintenance was notified and next flying crew were briefed about what happened.,A320 First Officer reported a dual system FADEC loss in cruise. The flight crew requested priority handling and continued to destination airport at a lower altitude.

We recovered the aircraft properly. Aircraft was ok. Upon further descent into ZZZ both FMCs failed which failed both flight directors. For safety sake; we leveled the aircraft off at 16;600 feet and were given a climb to 17;000 feet to figure out the aircraft issues. ATC [declared priority handling] to give us a direct path back to ZZZ1. Discussing the minimums for the approach into ZZZ RNAV XXL was 500 feet; LOC/BC XXL was 420 feet and the ILS XYR was 230 feet; now ATC advised us that minimums were 300 feet and that two aircraft before our arrival had done a go-around on the RNAV XXL. We requested ILS XXR but we're denied for saturation. Having to fly raw data approach with winds at the time of XXX/10 gusting to 19; Captain made the decision for safety to divert back to ZZZ1. Weather was good. Upon arrival into ZZZ1; autopilot and flight directors failed again; raw data approach to ILS XZ. We broke out at 1;660 feet for a visual approach into ZZZ1 and landed without incident. Maintenance found that FCC A failed.,B737 flight crew reported the loss of both FMCs during arrival. Due to poor weather conditions at destination; flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

The automatic seatbelt PA instructed our passengers to fasten seatbelts after turning on the seatbelt sign.2. Passenger screens aft of 'door 3' had all gone blank. (I believe they meant aft of the emergency doors).While in the process of being transferred from ZZZZ Controllers to ZZZZ1; the Captain received the message that smoke or a burnt odor was smelled by passengers and Flight Attendants in the cabin near row 19. The Relief Pilot returned to the flight deck about this time. The Smoke; Fire; Fumes immediate action items and QRC were run and the Captain [requested priority handling]. We diverted for ZZZZ and I was assigned control of the airplane and radios with instructions to get us to the airport. I flew the aircraft while the Relief Pilot and Captain completed QRH procedures. We remained clear of all oceanic tracks and communicated with ZZZZ Center. We completed non normal QRH procedures and performed all tasks associated with the descent but I do not recall returning to a normal descent checklist. Prior to the approach; the Captain assumed Pilot Flying duties again and landed the aircraft in ZZZZ. At a gate; The odor was confirmed by others. One passenger identified himself as a former avionics technician and said he definitely smelled a burnt electrical odor upon boarding the flight hours earlier in ZZZ. I never noticed the reported odors.,B767 Flight Crew reported a 'burnt odor' observed by passengers and flight attendants. The Captain requested priority handling to a suitable alternate airport where a safe landing was completed with no further issues.

At this time we were well into ZZZZ's airspace and approaching the ETP. Captain contacted Dispatch and they conferenced in Maintenance Control for advise and a second opinion. Maintenance did not have any additional suggestions. After consulting the Team; which included the Flight Deck jump seater; a Company First Officer; who happened to have Airbus experience; the decision was made to continue on to the destination as it could be done safely. We elected to [request priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and have emergency equipment standing by in the interest of safety. We landing in ZZZZ safely without and other incident.,A320 First Officer reported loss of Blue Hydraulic System in cruise. The flight crew continued to destination airport and landed.

I was told that passengers were very much complaining and trying to move to the forward half of the plane during the climb-out; approximately 4;000 ft. The inflight crew had to relocate as well.We immediately ran all necessary procedures. I asked my FO (First Officer) to continue flying and to take the radios so that I could begin troubleshooting. The odor isolation procedure proved to be unsuccessful. After each step; I checked back with the inflight crew to see if conditions improved. They did not. The QRH procedures were also unsuccessful; up to the point where we were forced to turn BOTH packs off. At this point; it was obvious that we would not be able to climb above 10;000 ft. due to our unpressurized state. Continuing to ZZZZ was no longer viable. At this point; I assumed the radios and asked ATC for a return to ZZZ.Inflight crewmembers stated that the fumes had subsided at this point; but they were experiencing symptoms such as dizziness; burning eyes; chest pain; and labored breathing. Each inflight crewmember seemed to have different symptoms. I asked if they wanted medical attention; to which they declined. As we got closer to ZZZ; I told the First Officer that I would rather request help and not need it rather than the other way around. While the First Officer was managing the aircraft and radios; I notified Dispatch; ran the divert QRH; the Over-Weight Landing QRH; helped reprogram the FMS; etc. A normal approach and soft landing was made. All overweight considerations were made and the emergency vehicles followed us to the gate. No assistance was needed. Upon arrival; a normal deplaning was conducted. EMS checked out the entire crew.,A320 Captain reported being notified by the Flight Attendants of an 'intense fume event' in the cabin. The Flight Crew returned to the departure airport.

AFL we received an ECAM caution message ANTI ICE CAPT L STAT and ANTI ICE CAPT R STAT. First Officer (FO) was pilot flying (PF). After aircraft was in clean configuration; I assigned FO the aircraft and radios while I ran QRC; ECAM; QRH; and follow up actions. I selected AIR DATA SWITCH to CAPT 3 per ECAM. The Captain; FO; and STBY airspeed and altitude indications appeared accurate. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and explained the circumstances. Maintenance Control ran a real-time diagnostic query on the system and advised me that the aircraft was reporting a faulty PROBE HEAT COMPUTER #1. During our discussion regarding continuation of the flight to ZZZ1; the Captain and FO altimeters started to diverge. When the difference reached 300 ft. between Captain and FO altimeters; I directed the FO to advise ATC we were not RVSM capable. At this point the Captain altimeter read 30;300 ft.; the STBY altimeter read 29;700 ft.; and the FO altimeter read 30;000 ft. I was still connected on communications and advised Maintenance Control of our diverging altimeter discrepancy. Maintenance Control performed another query and advised us the aircraft was reporting a failure of both CAPT STATIC PORTS; and then recommended we return to ZZZ; and Dispatch and I agreed. We considered the FO instruments to be the most reliable and relied primarily on them. I coordinated our return to ZZZ; reviewed the QRH NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS; briefed Flight Attendants (FA's) and passengers; and ran the QRH procedure for OVERWEIGHT LANDING. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and the FO made a perfectly soft landing. We exited the runway and ZZZ COMMAND checked the aircraft then advised us everything appeared normal; then followed us to the gate. Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entries were made for the mechanical discrepancy and overweight landing.,A319 flight crew reported receiving anti ice caution messages on initial climb; followed by increasing divergence of Captain's and First Officer's altimeter indications. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

The APU was on MEL and on the inbound flight Gen 2 had failed. I talked with maintenance and the plan was to fix both. They were working on the APU and waiting on a part for Gen 2. Because Gen 2 would require an engine run; we held off boarding until this was complete. Maintenance finished their work and we started boarding. The APU was cleared but Gen 2 was still inop. We obtained Version 2 of the release with MEL 24-XX-XXX. Our altitude was lowered to FL330 per the MEL. MEL A22-XX-XX was also applied. I chose to run the APU during the entire preflight and boarding to make sure that it was good. I also added 1000 lbs. of gas to offset the APU burn on our 4+36 minute flight. We departed at XA38z or XB38 pacific. 38 minutes late. Taxi out and take-off were uneventful. We had a significant number of live TVs out perhaps it would be better to turn the TV system off when working on the aircraft electrical system. Passing FL320 our APU shutdown! We descended back to FL310 and attempted a relight. The APU restarted Hooray! And then auto shutdown about 10 seconds later. We were now single generator with no chance to get a second one online. I made the decision to return to ZZZ. We were only 30 minutes out and it had a long sea level runway with good weather. I notified the Flight Attendants with using the emergency call. I had started with all call but when only 2 answered I used emergency call. I wanted the entire crew on the call. The Flight Attendant 1 asked if it was urgent; and I said yes. We informed ATC that we needed to return to ZZZ. They asked if we wanted to request priority handling and I said yes do to the overweight landing. We were around 180000 lbs at that time we landed around 176000 lbs. I notified Dispatch via ACARS and he notified the ZZZ station. We completed the aircraft monitor and QRH. We also ran the overweight landing checklist. We landed at ZZZ at XC00 local XD00Z. We shot the ILS XXL. I intercepted the glide slope early and followed it down. I also configured early. While the overweight checklist mentioned turning the auto thrust off and slowing to get below the flap speed; this wasn't required at our weight. I used auto brakes low and max reverse. Max brake temperature was around 200 degrees C. Taxi in was uneventful and we parked at Gate five minutes after touchdown.,A321 Captain reported an APU auto shut down after departure. With one Engine IDG already on MEL; the flight crew elected to perform an air turn back and overweight landing rather than attempt ETOPS to destination airport.

The odor was smoky/oily in nature and increased in intensity. FO (First Officer) was also getting irritation in his eyes and throat. The crew ran the aircraft odor; then fumes check; and diverted to ZZZZ. We landed without incident. We were checked out by the ZZZZ Fire Department; taxied to parking; and deplaned the passengers. Since the source of the odor was unknown [and] increased in intensity; we diverted to the nearest airfield; ZZZZ.,A319 Flight Crew reported a fume event during cruise and that they safely diverted to an alternate airport.

Received an ANTI ICE LEAK ENG R EICAS Message displayed climbing through approximately 10;500 ft. Annunciated checklist was completed resulting in the right engine being reduced to idle thrust. [Priority handling was requested] and a return to ZZZZ was requested with ATC. The NON-NORMAL LANDING checklist was run followed by the OVERWEIGHT LANDING checklist. The landing app was used to derive landing distance; runway XX provided more than sufficient distance on the runway at our weight. All normal checklists were completed.Operation was conducted in VFR conditions. ILS XX was set up in the navigation and briefed to provide glide path and a more stable approach and touchdown.Approach; transition were normal; rate of descent at touchdown was minimal; very soft and we rolled the aircraft the full length of the runway. We requested ATC to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) meet us at the end of Runway XX to inspect the brakes; ATC requested that we turn off the runway onto taxiway hotel. No ARFF came. We asked again and were provided a standard taxi instruction. We explained out need and asked again for ARFF. We were requested to taxi up X to Y taxiway before ARFF would check our aircraft. With brakes still in white we attempted the taxi without using brakes. Turning onto Taxiway Y BRAKE TEMP EICAS message displayed. ARFF then came out to evaluate. At that point brakes brakes 7;8;10 and 11 had just come into cautionary range. Approximately 25 minutes after landing. We stopped the aircraft on Y without using the parking brake. ARFF checked the brakes and said brakes and tires looked good and we could continue our taxi to the gate. Taxi Brake Cooling Chart at our weight showed 30 more minutes of cooling was needed to be considered safe. Shortly after; the number 7 Tire lost pressure. Thankfully ARFF had stayed with us as we sat through the cooling window. We found a huge disconnect communicating with the Tower and the relay of information from the ARFF team. For 98% of the operational needs of the airport; ZZZZ Tower does a great job. When situations like this take place; the ability to relay nuanced information between the fire trucks and the cockpit was a struggle. There were a few very key moments that were left with dead air or need to ask for clarification of the status of the situation. As we approached our brake cooling time; the temperature of the brakes was back in the normal range. Our mechanics showed up on Taxiway Y with a tug and headset. After they assessed the aircraft to be safe; ARFF accompanied us to the gate without further incident.In reviewing aircraft log and history of right engine fire loop 1 issues before departure; crew discussed possible scenarios to be warry of on our route especially the MOCA on our route crossing into the country. ZZZZ ATC has a very difficult time understanding requests past basic communication. We discussed this as part of our threat forward briefing. Unlike some airports; there is no way for pilots to talk directly to the firefighters checking the airplane other than hand signals. At ZZZZ; the only way to communicate with the firefighters is through the Tower Controller. Depth of English can sometimes be unpredictable. Controllers switch between English and Spanish and their accent is very unusual. May be a very good idea to update the company pages that there needs to be extra clear and concise communication. Any delay or wavering in response should be rephrased to ensure that the message is understood between both parties.,B777-200 flight crew reported receiving an ANTI ICE LEAK ENG R EICAS Message displayed during climb. The flight crew ran the check lists and QRH and reduced the Right Engine to idle thrust. Priority handling was requested and an air turn back and precautionary landing was made at departure airport.

At that time the Captain was the pilot flying (PF) and stated he had control of the aircraft. As the pilot monitoring (PM); I opened the QRH and read the corresponding page and actions. The Captain followed the procedure and reduced the #1 throttle until the light went out at an N1 of 80. A few minutes later as we were passing FL260 the light returned and the Captain further retarded the throttle to 76 N1. As we passed FL200 the light again came on and would not clear even with the #1 throttle at idle. We followed the procedure and shutdown the #1 engine. At this time we [requested priority handling] and received vectors direct to the ILS to Runway XXC. Once we completed the QRH the Captain passed the controls to me and we swapped the pilot flying and pilot monitoring roles. We executed an uneventful single engine approach to XXC and exited the runway. After a quick inspection from Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) we taxied to the gate and shutdown.No causal factors or than engine oil issues. After talking to Maintenance review they discovered it was a previous gripe from greater than 3 days ago.We were successful in this event because of the excellent training we received.,B737-800 Flight Crew reported on arrival; descending through FL300 when the #1 Engine Oil Filter Bypass light illuminated. The flight crew ran the checklists and QRH; continuing to descend. The flight crew requested priority handling; performed an in flight shut down of the #1 Engine and made a precautionary landing at the destination airport.

We climbed to FL330 and leveled off for 10 minutes. We were then given a clearance to climb to FL350. Shortly after leveling off; we noticed airframe buffeting. We then noticed that the Number 2 Engine was at around 65% N1 and the white trend line was at the climb limit. The the auto-throttles disconnected. The no. 1 engine was at 95%. I moved the Number 2 throttle forward and aft; but could not get the motor to accelerate past 65% N1. The buffeting continued; all other engine indications were normal. We decided to run the Engine Limit/Surge/Stall checklist and ask for lower. When the power setting was reduced to 57% N1; the vibration stopped and the engine ran normally. We completed the checklist. At this point we were around 300 miles from ZZZ; or about 50 minutes from touchdown. We decided to continue on and [request priority handling]. We anticipated a normal landing but decided to treat it as a single engine landing and request Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting meet us upon landing. We ran the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist and the Non-Routine Landing Checklist. We landed normally and taxied to the gate after being examined by the Fire Chief.,Pilot reported engine vibration during final climb to cruise altitude. Flight crew reduced power until vibration stopped and continued to destination airport.

Cruise check at XA:13 revealed 7.5 quarts of oil in #2 Engine. Notified Dispatch of increased monitoring and awareness. At XA:43 6.5 quarts; at XA:00 5.0 quarts. After consulting with Maintenance Control and Dispatch; joint decision to divert to ZZZ. In preparation for landing and looking at overweight considerations; crew requested Runway XXR at ZZZ; the longest available runway. Approach granted request and declared priority handling for flight so they could accommodate things. Aircraft landed at approx 177;000 pounds; 6;000 pounds overweight. Touchdown VS was 160 FPM. Rollout and taxi in were uneventful.,A321 First Officer reported decreasing engine oil quantity on #2 Engine in cruise. The flight crew requested priority handling and diverted to make a precautionary landing.

A go around was initiated followed by a hold so that we could run all of our necessary checklists and troubleshoot the issue. A phone patch with me was initiated to get their input as to whether or not we would have normal braking with the BRAKES RELEASED message. After we were comfortable with all of the information that we had; we requested priority handling as a precaution and requested landing on Runway XXL as it was the longest runway available. Code yellow was issued to the inflight. Landing was uneventful with normal braking. Crash Fire Rescue was requested to follow the aircraft just in case we encountered any other issues.,A320 pilot reported upon gear extension for landing; receiving an ECAM for BRAKE AUTO BRK FAULT as well as BRAKES RELEASED. A go-around was performed and the checklists and QRH were run. The flight crew requested priority handling and made a precautionary landing at destination airport.

On take-off roll; after V1 and just prior to rotation; aircraft shuttered; and began vibrating. Take-off continued. Immediately after getting airborne anti-skid inoperative light illuminated. Initial assessment was a possible locked wheel; due to anti-skid failure during take-off. At this point; we did not suspect a blown tire and raised both gear and flaps normally. Continued the departure while referencing the QRH for anti-skid inoperative light. After completing the checklist; ran performance data planning numbers for ZZZ1. Landing performance did not allow continuing to ZZZ1. Coordinated air return to ZZZ with ATC and Dispatch. Due to the vibration we experienced on take-off; anticipated the possibility of a blown tire on landing. Due to this possibility; we [requested priority handling] to ensure priority response was available upon landing. To minimize impact on operations in ZZZ; coordinated to land Runway XX. Passengers were informed of the problem. Flight Attendants were directed to prepare the cabin for arrival; based on the possibility of the need to conduct an evacuation. Landing with anti-skid inoperative and landing with blown tire procedures were thoroughly reviewed and briefed. Arrival into ZZZ was uneventful. Upon configuring for landing; the right main landing gear indicator light did not illuminate. Back-up light on overhead panel showed landing gear down; continued with the approach. Upon landing; speed brakes were manually deployed and maximum thrust reverser was used. During rollout; aircraft vibrated significantly and pulled right; but was controllable; remaining on the center line. After the aircraft had slowed below 50 kts; very light braking was applied and aircraft was brought to a complete stop. Flaps were left at 40 to prevent any possible further damage if a blown tire had occurred. After landing; Flight Attendants called and reported that oxygen masks in row XX had deployed. ZZZ fire arrived immediately and informed us that the number three main tire was blown. Brake temperatures were negligible. We were also informed hydraulic fluid was leaking from the right main landing gear. Aircraft was shut down using normal procedures. Coordinated with Operations and initial plan was to tow aircraft back to gate with passengers on board. Maintenance arrived; and informed us that they would need to change the tire; at which point; I determined the best course of action was to have the passengers; deplane via air-stairs and take buses back to the terminal. Upon the arrival of the air-stairs; deplaning the passengers was uneventful. Throughout this situation; the performance of my crew was exemplary. Passengers were kept fully informed of the actions we were taking; but also apprised of the potential risks. Due to our early departure out of ZZZ (time); after landing; coordination with all the Ground personnel took quite a bit of time; but passengers were kept fully informed at every step of the process. Other actions taken: Requested runway inspections for both Runways YYL and XX. Coordinated for hydraulic cleanup on Runway XX. Given the initial indications; I would not change how I handled this situation. If we had suspected a blown tire; would not have raised the landing gear.,B737-700 Flight Crew reported anti skid failure on take-off caused a blown main wheel tire. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF). While climbing thru FL340 with the Autopilot and autothrottle engaged; we experienced a significant loss of electrical power. The autopilot and autothrottle disconnected; Master Caution illuminated with ELEC on my six pack along with numerous amber warning lights. We also lost most background lighting at this time. I stated 'your aircraft;' canceled the Master Caution; the FO stated 'my aircraft;' and took manual control of the aircraft. I contacted ATC to request a level off at FL350 and stated that we had a problem we needed to work on. My initial thought was that we had just lost a generator; but that it would be a quick fix. After focusing my attention on the overhead panel and seeing the many amber lights along with the loss of background lighting; I realized it was more serious. I positioned the APU switch to start and told ATC that we would need to return to ZZZ. I'm not one hundred percent positive that I [requested priority handling] with ATC at that point. I know I had hit the mic switch to talk to ATC with the intent to [request priority handling] when I heard the FO say 'I have nothing on my side.' I diverted my attention to the FO's side and could see that he had no flight instruments and was hand flying while looking cross cockpit at my displays. I will add at this point that for some reason; my audio panel kept switching from VHF1 to FLT on its own making communication with ATC more difficult. At this time I felt that it was better for me to fly and have the FO assume the role of pilot monitoring (PM). The FO suggested we descend; being concerned that the APU may not start and we may ultimately have a problem with the pressurization system. I wasn't too concerned that the APU would not start as we had not been airborne for long enough for it to be cold soaked; but I was concerned about overall fuel pressure to the engines as we had numerous fuel pump low pressure lights illuminated. I agreed and he began to coordinate for a lower altitude with ATC as I took the aircraft and directed him to check the QRC and open the QRH for the proper electrical checklist. After taking control of the aircraft; I found that I could not actuate the elevator trim using the switches on my yoke and asked the FO if his worked. He tried his and stated that his did not work either. We were both a bit unsure which checklist was appropriate as the Bus Switching (electrical) panel looked normal initially; and no lights were illuminated on the Generator Drive and Standby Power panel. However; from all appearances; we had suffered a major loss of AC power and were operating on standby power. We both agreed that; even though no Transfer Bus Off lights or Source Off lights were illuminated; the most appropriate checklist to start with was the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist. The APU started normally and indicated that the APU generator was available. After completing the initial steps of the checklist with no restoration of power; I had the FO hold the checklist and contact the flight attendants to let them know we were working an electrical problem; that we were returning to ZZZ; and to find out if they had enough lighting in the back and ask if everyone was okay. After taking control of the radios so the FO could run the checklists; I continued to coordinate with ATC for lower altitude; giving the requested info; and requesting Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) equipment meet us at ZZZ. Once level at 16;000 ft. and approximately 45 miles from ZZZ; I requested delay vectors for time to work the problem and had the FO take control of the aircraft. Just as I was relinquishing control; I felt the trim wheel move slightly. I thought the FO may had begun to trim; so I did not say anything. The FO then observed the same thing. My thought was that maybe the Speed Trim system was doing that; but unsure how it could have done that given the failure of AC power that we had. I knew that neither one of us had done it and that neither one of us had use of electric trim; so I elected to move both stab trim cutout switches to cutout; and remove it completely from the equation. I informed the Flight Attendants that we were still working our electrical problem and informed the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZ. I then elected to review the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist and determined we had both arrived at the same conclusion. Since it appeared as though we were on Standby Power; or some state in between; I decided to review the Additional Information at the end to the checklist; regarding the 'unlikely event that a landing must be made on standby power.' I'm glad I did that; as it would come into play later. At this point; I went thru the overhead panel to review all of the various indications we were presented with. The Window Heat panel indicated overheat on two of the windows; as expected with a loss of power. The Low Pressure light for Electric Pump 2 was illuminated on the Hydraulic panel. The pneumatic duct pressure needles were both pointing at the (approximately) 12 o'clock position; very unusually high. We were also noticing that the temperature in the aircraft was getting very warm. The FO attempted to adjust the temperature using the temperature control knobs; but that seemed to have no effect. I directed him to turn all three temp control knobs to the off position in hopes that the packs would regulate to 75 and 65 degrees respectively. That had no effect so I later directed him to turn the trim air switch off and leave it at that. We had no Pack or Zone Temp lights illuminated. We checked the pressurization system and it seemed to be functioning properly the entire time with no lights illuminated. We had fuel in the center tank; so all six fuel pump switches were in the on position; but at this point; four of the six had low pressure lights illuminated. The only ones providing pressure were the left center and forward pump in the left wing. The FO then brought to my attention that we were beginning to get out of balance on the fuel. I reconfigured the fuel panel to correct for that and continued to evaluate the problem. The AC and DC Metering panel had only the BAT DISCHARGE light illuminated. The TR UNIT light was not illuminated. I was confident that the BAT DISCHARGE light was due mostly to the APU start. The panel indicated -5 amps and 25 volts for the battery at this point. Gen 2 showed no frequency and no volts; but the GEN OFF BUS light for number 2 was not illuminated. Gen1 indicated good frequency and volts; but did not appear to pick up the load with the initial step of the checklist and the GEN OFF BUS light remained illuminated. At this point; we had the APU generator connected to Bus 1. It appeared to me that the majority (but not all) of the problem may have been with Transfer Bus 2. I did a quick review of the Transfer Bus Off checklist in hopes that it may be of some help; but ultimately we were stuck with what we had. I then decided to take control of the aircraft and directed the FO to sit back and methodically look thru all of our indications and verify that we were not overlooking anything.While the FO was performing that task; I communicated our request for the ILS XXC at ZZZ. We had just departed ZZZ and we knew that ZZZ was VFR. With the BAT DISCHARGE light illuminated; and the significant power loss we had experienced; I did not want to delay any further; so we informed ATC that we were ready to continue to ZZZ. I then transferred control of the aircraft and radios to the FO and requested that; with the next ATC controller; he confirm that they were aware we were a [priority] aircraft and we wanted the ARFF equipment to meet us. I accomplished the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist; coordinated with the Flight Attendants; and advised the passengers that we would be landing shortly and that they would see airport safety vehicles around the aircraft after we had stopped on the runway. I then took control of the aircraft and the FO resumed the duties of PM. As we were approaching ZZZ we were advised that the ILS was out of service on XXC and were asked if we would like XXL. Given our current circumstances; I wanted the longest runway available. The FO then asked for XXR and was told that the ILS XXR was out of service as well. Apparently the FAA was performing some flight checks of the equipment that night. I asked the FO to request the RNAV XXC; mostly just for initial lateral and vertical guidance; as we wanted a long final due to the hand flying and manual trim necessary for the approach. We discussed threats; I briefed the approach; and accomplished all normal checklists. Before beginning the approach; I reviewed with the FO what was in the Additional Information on the Loss of Both Engine Driven Generators checklist and that; in particular; the flap position indicator may be inoperative for us. We also discussed that the Speed Brake Do Not Arm light was illuminated; so I would not arm the speed brakes for landing and that I would need to manually deploy them on landing. I began to slow the aircraft and configure for landing on Runway XXC. The FO pointed out that we had proper indications on the leading edge devices; but no indication on the flap gauge for the trailing edge flaps. I let him know that with each flap selection; I could feel the pitch change anticipated with normal flap movement and there was no rolling tendency. Everything felt as though it was operating normally. Due to time constraints; I had decided not to run the Stab Inoperative Checklist; but I am aware that the Stab Trim Inoperative checklist states to plan a flaps 15 landing. Given that the weather and visibility at ZZZ was very good; unsure of anti-skid operation; and in consideration of everything else that was going on; I wanted the approach to be as normal as possible and elected to land with flaps 30. I was comfortable hand flying and the manual trim inputs required were very manageable. Much more so than in the sim. I informed the FO that if we needed to go-around for any reason; I anticipated not using full go-around power and that we would do things at a slower pace to account for the manual trim required. We landed safely on XXC and brought the aircraft to a stop. I retracted the speed brakes and directed the FO to move the flaps to 40. The FO communicated with ARFF while I quickly made a PA to the passengers and spoke briefly with the Flight Attendants. As we were waiting for ARFF to inspect the aircraft; I noticed that we had a TR UNIT and ELEC light illuminated now that we were on the ground. We got the 'all clear' from ARFF and had them follow us as we taxied back to the terminal.Cause: Electrical system malfunction.Suggestions: The electrical non-normals should have some notes regarding fuel balance. I know that is part of normal flying duties; but it is often difficult to analyze various electrical problems; and with everything going on; that can easily fall out of your crosscheck and be missed until the fuel is out of balance.,B737-800 Flight Crew reported while climbing thru FL340 with the autopilot and autothrottle engaged; they experienced a significant loss of electrical power. The autopilot and autothrottle disconnected; Master Caution illuminated with ELEC on the six pack along with numerous amber warning lights. Flight crew returned to departure airport.

Initial takeoff normal. Airspeed alive call made. During takeoff roll we had an ECAM pop up. I believe this happened before 80 knots. I am unsure if I made the 80 knots power set call. Captain advanced thrust levers to TOGA. No continuing call made; but I understood the intention to go at TOGA. Engine 2 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) mode fault along with Engine 2 system fault at the bottom of the ECAM page. To be clear this is what the ECAM read after the Rejected Takeoff (RTO) as we had a chance to read it after stopping. Everything else seemed normal with the aircraft at this point. At this point an RTO thought popped into my mind. Being go minded this seemed like a reasonable response as the aircraft did not feel as if it was unable to fly. As we accelerated we heard a Bang. The Captain called reject and at this point the takeoff was rejected. This was during high speed regime. Unsure as to actual speed. No call made as I was distracted by the bang and ECAM. I advised tower that we were rejecting the takeoff and we taxied clear of the runway to a stop. Reading through the ECAM; we shut down Engine 2 and started the APU. A call to remain seated was made. I talked to the in-flight crew to see if they smelled or saw anything of concern. One crew member mentioned the smell of burnt rubber which I figured was somewhat normal as we had indeed heated up the brakes. After coordinating with company and ATC we proceeded back to the gate. We also; at this time made a PA to the cabin advising that we were returning to the gate. The aircraft taxied without any tactile indication that the tire was flat. Didn't find out about that until gate return. At the gate the Captain addressed the customers and told them as much as he knew about our next steps.,A320 First Officer reported a high speed rejected takeoff due to an engine failure. The engine was shut down and the aircraft returned to the gate for maintenance.

It got stronger as we climbed. I called the Flight Attendant (FA) and asked to check the entire cabin to see if they could detect any smell. They reported no smell. After discussing the situation with the First Officer (FO); I transferred control over to him. The FO [requested priority handling] and I ran the QRH procedure for the Smoke and Fumes and also for the overweight landing. The smell went away once I had turned off the avionics cooling system. Fire trucks were awaiting for our arrival. FO performed the landing and I noted the VSI at touchdown was -200 fpm. Once we exited the runway; I made a PA to passengers to remain seated and that we would return to the gate. I spoke to ZZZ Chief Pilot and Dispatcher. Submitted via the iPad the report to maintenance. Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry made.Cause - Electrical odor smell in cockpit.,Air Carrier Flight Crew reported a strong electrical insulation odor during initial climb. The Flight Crew returned to the departure airport and landed.

The bleed configuration was still the same from takeoff: engine bleeds on; APU bleed off; packs auto; isolation valve auto; recirc fans on; trim air on. Around this time we entered icing conditions and turned the engine anti-ice on. Moments later we received a call from the cabin. They reported a 'strong burning' smell; no visible smoke; and it was not obvious where it was coming from. While the First Officer (FO) and I began to diagnose the situation we received another call from the cabin indicating that odor was getting worse. The FO and I put our oxygen masks on; [requested priority handling] to return to ZZZ. Throughout the event the Flight Attendants (FA) reported difficulty breathing; dizziness; and one of them developed a nose bleed. We ran the non-normal checklist. The Flight Attendants reported that odor/fumes had improved in the back of the aircraft and the forward Flight Attendant stated it was no longer getting worse. The approach and landing was normal. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) did a thermal scan of the aircraft after we cleared the runway. Everything on the exterior of the aircraft appeared normal. We taxied to the terminal and deplaned normally. The Flight Attendants reported that none of the passengers had requested medical assistance. The number 4 Flight Attendant with the nose bleed reported they were in stable condition to complete the deplaning process and was treated for the condition afterwards.Communicating with the oxygen masks on is very loud and adds a distraction and barrier to communication. Task saturation was a challenge as well. Reinforcing the importance of following SOPs and using good threat and error management will help crews navigate events like these with a successful outcome.,Air Carrier Flight Crew reported a Flight Attendant notification of a 'strong burning' odor in the cabin during initial climb. Flight crew returned to the departure airport where a safe landing was completed.

The mechanic that was on the aircraft came up to the flight deck. He checked for faults but nothing. The aircraft to our right was getting de-iced and we figured with the wind it probably injected a little of the de-ice fluid and it was going away. The mechanic released the flight saying it was probably deciding fluid. After we took off on the climb we noticed it came back and the Flight Attendants (FA) said they smelt it too very strongly towards door XX there was a faint smoke as well. Flight crew [requested priority handling] to turn back to ZZZ for safety. We accomplished the Fume Event checklist and the Overweight Landing checklist as well. Dispatch send landing data. We came back to the departure runway for a landing. We pulled off the runway. Fire crew then conducted there safety checks on heat and smoke and felt it was safe to return to the gate. We returned to the gate.,Air Carrier Flight Crew reported a fume event during initial climb. The flight crew returned to the departure airport where a safe landing was completed

Ensured Captain remained pilot flying (PF) by stating 'Your Aircraft' and ran the Quick Reference Checklist. As I was running the Quick Reference Checklist the ECAM went away and the vibration subsided. We monitored engine parameters for abnormalities and found that the #1 Engine had a higher EGT than the #2 Engine but still in the green (normal limits). We (PF and (PM) pilot monitoring) began reviewing QRH material and potential diversion airports in the event the engine continued to have issues. We came up with a plan for enroute diversion if needed; and briefed what we should do if the engine failed on descent or on approach. Planned a Flaps 3 approach; reviewed Single Engine go-around and 10-7 requirements. The engine continued to run at about 30-60 degrees hotter than the #2 Engine; but still well within normal ops limits. No further vibrations at altitude. No issues during descent. I monitored and continued to write down EGT for both engines on descent (and presented to [contract maintenance]). Turning final at about 2;000-2;500 ft. MSL the #1 Engine began to vibrate slightly; as the gear was lowered and Flaps 3 was initiated the engine began to vibrate substantially; spitting and sputtering. I announced to the Captain (PF) that Engine #1 was failing based on the reduction in power and higher EGT. An ECAM appeared stating ENG 1 STALL. As we were about 3-4 miles from landing and immediately after ECAM I ensured Captain had the aircraft; reviewed the QRC; as the ECAM went away again PF pulled #1 thrust lever back as I guarded #2 thrust lever. I ensured Captain placed #2 thrust lever in maximum continuous thrust. We decided to continue on a Single Engine approach and landing after a very brief discussion (as we had already briefed this earlier in flight if the engine were to fail on final). I requested priority handling to ZZZ; stated nature of the situation (southeast landing; engine failure; Souls on Board; Fuel on board) and that we would taxi clear. The Captain (PF) landed uneventfully as the #1 Engine had remained in operating limits after reducing power. Upon landing I started the APU. As we taxied clear of the runway the Tower controller stated that the #1 Engine was on fire and that she saw flames coming out the back as well as smoke. We just then received an ECAM stating the ENG 1 OIL FILTER CLOGGED. The Captain immediately shut the #1 Engine down. I asked the Captain if he wanted to consider the evacuation checklist; but then The Tower Controller stated the flames had dissipated but there was a great deal of smoke still coming from the engine exhaust. Then the Tower Controller stated the smoke was subsiding. We did not attempt to run the evacuation checklist because the flames/smoke situation appeared under control. We had already stopped on the ramp area clear of other aircraft; and as the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) trucks approached we attempted to gain comms with the trucks. We could not get the same frequency as the ARFF trucks and relayed information through the Tower Controller and attempted hand signals with the ARFF crew. The ARFF crews stopped approximately 30 yards from the front of the aircraft and approached without equipment as it appeared the fire had gone out. There were no indications of fire from inside the cockpit. After ARFF inspection we taxied to the hardstand area for further inspection before allowing passengers to deplane via air-stairs. It would have been nice to have the ARFF frequency available to communicate directly with ARFF as they approached rather than relaying through Tower frequency. Language barriers are often an issue in foreign countries but did not play a significant factor during this event. However; I am unsure if the Tower Controller actually knew what 'PAN PAN' meant.,A321 First Officer reported receiving multiple ECAMS for the number one engine during cruise. The flight crew performed an in-flight shutdown of the affected engine and continued to the destination airport.

The Pilot Flying (PF) called for and initiated a Go Around (GA) while I coordinated with Tower as Pilot Monitoring (PM). We received a vector to the west and maintain 3;000 feet. We executed the non normal procedure down to the QRH which states differential braking will be required to steer during taxi. As PM I further searched the ECAM supplemental for amplifying info. As PM I requested delay vectors from ATC and coordinated with operations to be towed in once on the ground. We then discussed the potential for difficulty steering on the ground; deciding it would be prudent to advise ATC of potentially requiring extended time on the runway after landing due to a nose wheel steering issue. I believe ATC [requesting priority handling] on our behalf as they requested souls on board and had airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) standing by on landing. We then conducted an uneventful landing; cleared the runway and came to a stop on taxiway waiting for ground crew to tow us in. A maintenance issue with the aircraft causing the NW steering fault.Suggestion - Safety wiring of connection/cannon plug to NW steering.,Pilot reported nose wheel steering fault message during approach. The flight crew continued to destination airport; landed; and were towed to the gate.

After performing ECAM actions and referencing the communications (COM); it was a crew awareness item. Approximately 30 minutes later at the top of descent on the ZZZZZ arrival we received an ECAM of ELAC 1 Pitch Fault; autopilot off; Alternate law with all Protection lost. After performing ECAM and referencing the COM we decided that we were stuck in Alternate Law and the COM referenced us to perform the Alternate Law procedure. After going over that we decided that continuing on the arrival and landing in ZZZ was our best option. It was also a perfect weather day in ZZZ. We landed with Flaps 3 and also Vref plus 10 per the procedure. We requested priority handling knowing we would eventually land. Briefed the Flight Attendants that we expected a normal landing but they would see the crash fire rescue (CFR) trucks and if anything changed we would let them know. Also made a PA explaining what happened and also that they would see the CFR trucks and this was a precautionary situation but we expected a normal landing. We then proceeded to ZZZ and made a successful; normal landing in direct law. Continued to the gate with no further incidence after talking to CFR and releasing them.,A320 Captain reported the loss of both ELACs in cruise. The flight crew requested priority handling and continued to the destination airport in Alternate Law. A precautionary landing was made.

This aircraft had a write up about excessive dead band in roll control in flight which was cleared by Maintenance. 30 ft. above ground I felt something is not right; and I felt my aileron had no authority. The aircraft jerked twice and was not responsive. Upon reaching 1000 ft; retracted the flaps and accelerated to 210 kts. During a turn to the left again; I felt the aircraft was not turning the way it should; even when I had good control column input. I remember reading the logbook about dead band in roll movement and realized I was in the same situation. Climbed to 8;000 ft. and asked for a few different headings from the Departure Controller to see if is getting better but no change. The turn was either sluggish to one side or sharp to the opposite side. Tried to get a phone patch to Maintenance Controller with no luck. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch and was given an instruction to land. On final approach I had 10 to 15 degrees right aileron input to maintain the final approach course. Landing was uneventful.,B737-700 flight crew reported a dead band in the controls and unresponsive aileron control on takeoff. The flight crew made an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

Transferred controls to the First Officer and completed Engine Oil Filter Bypass Non Normal checklist. The alert extinguished at idle thrust on the Left Engine. The Engine was not shut down. I requested priority handling and briefed the Flight Attendants. Continued to land on Runway XXR as offered by ATC. ARFF equipment was standing by. Safest action was to land. Used flaps 15 single engine landing procedures with the Left Engine at idle. Taxied to the gate without any incident. Write up was made at the Gate.,B737 Captain reported Oil Filter Bypass Illuminated on Left Engine around 5;000 feet on vectors to land. The flight crew discontinued the approach and ran the check lists and QRH. The flight crew requested priority handling and performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at destination airport.

I notified the Captain immediately and we transferred controls to the Captains side to see if his trim would work. It did not work. Manual trim did not work either. We requested priority handling and coordinated with ATC a return to ZZZ. The aircraft was still trimmed as set for takeoff which helped for controllability. All checklists were accomplished and the landing was uneventful.,B737 flight crew reported automatic and manual stabilizer trim were inoperative after takeoff. The flight crew coordinated with ATC and performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

We thought this might just be a loud airplane.When we were at about FL216 I noticed our climb rate was zero and sometimes negative. There were tailwinds of approximately 50 kts. The Captain; also Pilot Flying (PF); selected speed from our current 320 kts. to 280 kts.. The aircraft initiated a climb but I don't recall climbing more than about 600 FPM and we didn't climb for long. Maybe a few hundred feet. I suggested to use vertical speed. The airspeed slowed as much as 260 kts. and we were climbing at a selected vertical speed up 1;200-1;500 FPM. I originally thought that we were having an auto flight problem; perhaps. I checked all the system pages and found them to be normal. The Engine Pressure Ratio was 1.34 I recall and thrust indication matched thrust lever angle cyan circles. At some point before this when the TAT reached 10 Degrees C; I had turned on the engine A/I. Both PFDs and the standby indicator matched airspeed indications. Finally; I had the idea to turn off the dome light and turn on the ice light and wing lights. I saw a large piece of clear ice on the ice indicator and it extended horizontally approximately 1 inch per side. The wings were somewhat hard to be sure but looked to have a good amount of clear but lumpy ice on them. I turned on the wing A/I after mentioning to the Captain.What I think happened was that the pitot tubes (all three) must have been frozen over and were no longer indicating accurate airspeed. Maybe the engine inlet sensors also as the Engine Pressure Ratio was lower than I would have expected and it increased some minutes after exiting the icing condition. I believe our airspeed was far higher than indicated as I've never heard wind noise that loud in the cockpit before. The plane seemed to not have enough power to maintain an altitude of FL 290 and had full power going Mach .78. After a few minutes the aircraft seemed to fly better and although Engine Pressure Ratio was now limited to I believe 1.44; the engines did not need to be at max thrust.This is a hard situation to fully understand because I'm not sure if the icing and its weight and drag were a larger factor or that I believe all three airspeed indicators might be iced over.,A320 First Officer reported excessive wind noise on climbout. Investigation determined that they were flying in icing conditions and were experiencing erratic Air Data Information due to all three Pitot Tubes frozen. The flight crew performed Anti Icing procedures and continued to destination airport.

At approx. 400 ft. AGL; the aircraft rolled left; then immediately right. The airspeed decayed then accelerated. I noticed the airspeed was now at 210 and the flaps were still at 25. I pitched up to avoid any further overspeed and asked for flaps 5 (should have said 15). My First Officer (FO) repeated my request questioningly; or rather confused. We were now at about 600 ft. I said we need flaps moving up now! My FO astutely recognized the reason for flap retraction below 1;000 ft. and complied. FO retracted to each Gate announcing as he did so. At 1;000 ft. my FO advised; The flaps are still at 2. I said; 'Move the handle back to 5. I will maintain 210 kts. Now try 10; Now try up. The flaps did not move. They were uniformly stuck at 2. No needle split. We told ZZZ Departure we wanted to stay at 3;000 ft. for flap problem. They asked if we were requesting priority handling. YES was our response. We requested diversion to ZZZ. We began the Trailing Edge Flap Disagree QRH Checklist. Once we got weather for ZZZ; we agreed winds were too gusty and headed for ZZZ1; where winds were much less. We requested holding at ZZZ1 - ZZZZZ fix on the XXR ILS to burn fuel in order to avoid an overweight landing. Once below; we landed on XXR uneventfully.,B737-800 flight crew reported aircraft control difficulty after takeoff. It was noticed that the Trailing Edge Flaps did not retract fully and were stuck. The flight crew requested priority handling and made two diversions due to weather before making a precautionary landing.

We verified the HYD System Synoptic page and saw that the quantity had fallen to the bottom of the level indicator. FO remained PF; and I the Captain (CA) ran the non-normal. After running non-normal and checking conditions outside of baseline in FCOM 1 and verifying specific acceptable data (Runway Length not sufficient under baseline due to aircraft (a/c) type and wet Runway) I called Maintenance via SatCom to confirm my system related findings and to coordinate with ZZZ Maintenance. I called the Cabin Crew on All Call and briefed; described issue; and gave them a 10 minute warning to landing; with no brace/evac planning needed. I chose not to advise the passengers due to the potential language barrier of most of the passengers from ZZZ1; which could cause more chaos than needed for them and In-Flight crew. Approach Controller was made aware of situation while we finished the HYD G LO LVL non-normal; which included gravity gear extension. Upon last handoff we [requested priority handling] since I asked to slow earlier; wanted to maneuver with more liberty; and the potential for HYD fluid to catch fire with braking. There was also potential for slat/flaps to transit slower; according to the ECAM status and checklist. For this reason; we wanted to configure a bit earlier than normal. I decided to take control of the aircraft before final turn to approach (we briefed this) because I was very specific about how I wanted fly the last 200 ft. through rollout. I chose not to use reverse thrust (other than idle on ENG2 due to unavailable reverser on ENG1 per the non-normal/ECAM Status;. After normal landing; and NWS available via system; we taxied to the Gate. We also called Operations to reconfirm local Maintenance was aware. After parking; I entered the ECAM Caution into the Maintenance Logbook as well as the fact that a gravity gear extension was accomplished. On the walk-around post flight; HYD fluid was pouring out of the drain mast of ENG1. No Customer or crew support was needed.,A321 Captain reported receiving a Caution / ECAM displayed for HYD Green Reservoir Low Level Message on descent. The flight crew continued to landing at destination airport.

Normal landing ensued in compliance with overweight landing checklist. Returned to gate to find outer radome cracked; inner radome de-laminated and ingestion on #2 Engine.,Pilot reported multiple bird strikes on takeoff. The Flight Crew performed an air turn back and overweight landing at departure airport.

This significantly reduced our workload in flight and reduced the number of errors committed during the ensuing event given the otherwise lack of training on the new SOPs.Climbing through 17;000 ft. we heard a loud bang and felt a jolt to the aircraft followed by an ENG 2 STALL ECAM. The stall cleared itself in less than 5 seconds. Captain (CA)/Pilot Monitoring (PM) referenced the QRH procedure. A Pilot riding in the cabin informed us that a visual flame was observed in the #2 engine associated with the compressor stall; but no external damage was observable. Engine was returned to normal operation following completion of the QRH procedure. At 35;000 ft.; approaching Top of Descent; the #2 engine experienced a second series of stalls. The stalls included an ECAM ENG 2 STALL message; erratic EPR indications; audible banging; and visual flames as reported by the Pilot riding in the cabin. The FO/Pilot Flying (PF) immediately retarded the thrust lever and the stall cleared. CA/PM executed QRH procedure; and we elected to operate the #2 engine at idle power for the duration of the flight. We [requested priority handling] with Center and requested a descent and expedited approach to ZZZ. 'Non-routine landing considerations' were reviewed and a precautionary landing was conducted to XXC. Fire/safety personnel inspected the aircraft after landing and indicated no visible damage. We taxied to the Gate.Landing with reduced thrust after running the QRH procedure is somewhat confusing. While not technically a single engine approach; we treated it as such (since it could turn into one at any second) and it would be helpful if the Engine Stall checklist would direct us to review 'Approach Considerations' on the QRH. This section is difficult to find in the heat of battle.,A321 Captain reported an engine compressor stall event in cruise. After completing the QRH procedure; the crew continued to the destination airport with the affected engine at idle power.

My last flight highlighted the issues. Landing on XL in ZZZ; the ATIS was reporting +TSRA and 2 1/2 miles visibility. We were cleared for the ILS Runway XR. At minimums; the Pilot Flying (PF) announced 'landing'. While the runway was somewhat distorted by the rain piling up on the windshield; neither of us felt it was bad enough to call for the go-around. Here lies the problem with not treating the windshields with a hydrophobic coating. The crew is lulled into a false sense of security to continue the landing. However; I believe; based on experience; that the Pilot's depth perception is severely and unknowingly impaired by the distorted view.This was just what we experienced. Just before touchdown; we got a Sink Rate Aural Warning. It was too late in the flare to initiate a go-around; as we touched down almost immediately after the warning.  As you might imagine; it was a hard landing. What was unnerving to us both was that neither of us had the slightest inclination that the aircraft was sinking. I attribute this to our distorted view through the windshield.  We felt that we had adequate visual reference to continue the landing; but clearly; we unknowingly did not. I have seen this happen other times as well and always in heavy rain. I happen to know that other airlines maintain their windshields better than we do. When I observed (other carrier) land immediately after us in the same conditions; they had a much more normal touchdown. I have worked for operators; in the past; who maintained the hydrophobic coating and never had any issues landing in heavy rain. We also didn't even have windshield wipers on our aircraft. I strongly believe Company is assuming unnecessary risk by choosing to operate this way.,B737-800 First Officer reported vision problems caused by the hydrophobic coating on the windscreens caused misjudgments and an excessive sink rate during landing. A hard landing was entered into the log book for maintenance action.

Between fixes ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1; and the Fuel Disagree Light Illuminated. The Fuel Disagree QRH Checklist was completed. A Fuel Leak was suspected and visually verified by the A Flight Attendant. The Fuel Leak Engine QRH Checklist was completed and resulted in shutting down #1 Engine. Dispatch was advised. ATC was advised by CPDLC. ATC issued a clearance to ZZZ2. Priority handling was requested with ATC. The One Engine Inoperative Landing QRH Checklist was completed and a single engine; Captain flown; landing in ZZZ2 was completed without further incident.  Brake cooling calculations were completed; ARFF checked the aircraft brakes and cleared the aircraft to proceed. Brake Cooling results indicated; Proceed to the gate. We taxied to the gate and deplaned.Threats: 1. I only flew with the First Officer for two legs prior to the event leg. Company Standard procedures precluded this from becoming an issue.2. QRH ambiguity. FUEL DISAGREE does not account for fuel remaining in the center tank. An imbalance will not occur with center tank fuel remaining.3. QRH procedure. FUEL LEAK ENGINE; A change in fuel imbalance of 500 lbs. within 30 minutes or less. We chose to evaluate the fuel split for 10 minutes and determined the volumetric flow rate of the leak was equivalent or greater than 500 lbs./30 minutes; thus confirming the leak 20 minutes earlier than if we had waited the entire 30 minutes like the QRH implies.4. Once we cleared the runway in ZZZ2 and were inspected by Fire Rescue; we were given a clearance to taxi to the gate. During the entire taxi time; Airport Operations Personnel continuously transmitted on Ground frequency seemingly to coordinate vehicular movement. This was an unnecessary distraction to us; because we thought the transmissions could potentially involve the movement of our aircraft. 5. After the Fire Rescue cleared us to taxi to the gate; Ground Control issued us the following clearance: 'Aircraft X; taxi XX; XY; XZ to the gate. Had we taxied immediately; our right wing would have contacted the fire truck parked on the south side of Taxiway XX. We queried Ground Control about the fire truck position. Ground Control specifically instructed the fire truck to start moving so we could proceed. We then proceeded to the gate.,B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported a Fuel Imbalance condition in cruise. The flight crew ran the QRH and Check lists and performed an in flight shut down of the #1 Engine for a Fuel Leak. The flight crew diverted to the nearest suitable airport.

We used the fix strategy to evaluate the caution and went thought the QRH. I was assigned the Flying Pilot/ radios at that point. The Captain called Dispatch and Maintenance Crew (M/C) to discuss the situation. After the Captain talked with M/C and Dispatch we decided going back to ZZZ was the best option for us. With the loss of steering and the possibility of the nose gear being at 90 degrees from center we wanted the ability to do a fly by and land on a dry runway. We looked at several airports along the route and weather was affecting most of the east coast.  We requested priority handling and coordinated a return to ZZZ. Upon lowing the landing gear in ZZZ we did not receive the secondary fault; along with the Tower verifying the nose gear was straight. We landed with no problems cleared the runway shutdown and got towed to the gate. We had a mechanical failure of the nose wheel steering. QRH should include a note to consider going to an airport with VFR weather.,A321 First Officer reported an ECAM Caution Message: WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT in  cruise. The flight crew ran the QRH and check lists. The flight crew requested priority handling and performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

Accomplished go-around because aircraft was accelerating and unstable. Made a visual approach without navigational guidance. Occurred due to an aircraft fault.,A321 pilot reported Air/Ground Sensing failure on gear extension. The flight crew executed a go-around to trouble shoot and run the QRH/check lists. The flight crew was unable to reprogram the aircraft to air mode and elected to land at destination airport.

Departed out of lax and got Engine 2 N2 high vibration. Ran ECAM actions and adjusted thrust lever and vibration went away. Continued to get spurious high vibration ECAMs multiple times throughout flight. About an hour into flight we got Eng 2 Oil Chip Detected ECAM which procedure only required Crew awareness. About 30 minutes after that while in descent around FL 250; we noticed a vibration and something didn't feel correct immediately followed by an Engine 2 Stall. Followed ECAM and procedures and tried to initiate a relight which was unsuccessful. We shut down Engine 2 and requested priority handling. Closest suitable airport was our destination of ZZZ and also runway was considerable length for landing distance; requested direct to the airport and ATC vectored us for final approach. We let Dispatch; Flight Attendants and Passengers know. Landed safely and stopped in taxiway for trucks to check out Number 2 Engine. No damage or fire reported. Taxied to the gate normally.,A320 First Officer reported Engine #2 N2 vibration after takeoff. Later in the flight; flight crew received Engine #2 Oil Chip Detected ECAM Message and noticed a vibration. The flight crew performed an inflight shut down and landed at destination airport.

IAS Disagree was displayed on both PFDs. A/T Limit was displayed on UD. I was PF (Pilot Flying) at the time worked together and agreed it was the FO's A/S that had failed. We transferred controls and accomplished A/S Unreliable QRH. After completing the QRH; both EECs went into soft Alternate Mode and Speed Trim failed. Shortly after this the Standby Attitude Indicator rolled right 30 degrees and went nose low 10 degrees. The FO's Altitude Indicator indicated 500 ft. off from CA (Captain) and Standby. we fired off a quick ACARS to Dispatch notifying of Systems Failures and situation. Flight Attendants were briefed.After we transferred controls; I became PF and took over ATC communications. Our first communication to ATC was we were experiencing instrument problems our Airspeed Indicators were failing as well as standby indications. ATC did not understand this and instructed us to turn left and speed up for spacing into ZZZ. I decided to request priority handling as the loss of A/S indications made it necessary. I requested direct ZZZ and lower altitude to get out of the clouds. We were cleared direct ZZZ and 10;000 ft. Once the workload slowed down and QRH accomplished; we both agreed to have ARFF standing by out of caution. We advised ATC we wanted ILS XX and the approach to landing was without event. Once clear of runway I told ATC no assistance would be needed from fire rescue. We taxied to gate and deplaned normal via jet way. I then contacted Dispatch; Maintenance Control and Operations as required for debrief. Appropriate ELB entries were entered and a more thorough brief via phone with Maintenance Control was accomplished.I did not alert the passengers to the situation. Both CA and FO agreed after accomplishing all QRH items we had working instruments on CA side and if nothing changes the landing would be normal and there was no need to stress the passengers.,B737 Captain reported First Officer's Airspeed failed with IAS Disagree was displayed on both PFDs in cruise. The flight crew ran the QRH and check lists; then both EECs went into Soft Alternate Mode and Speed Trim Failed. The flight crew requested priority handling and landed at destination airport.

Upon arriving into ZZZ; on the Pilot App; we saw that there was going to be an aircraft swap. The aircraft which we were to operate was coming from a hangar. It apparently had HYD SYS A malfunction. Maintenance Personnel advised us that Engine Driven HYD PUMP for SYS A was replaced and maintenance release was cleared.During climb; Master Caution light end ENG HYD PUMP lights illuminated. QRH was accomplished. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. We were advised to monitor quantity and pressure for SYS A. Within the next ten minutes we observed HYD SYS A quantity drop to 20%. SYS A continued to operate normally on the electric pump.Captain and I referred to the FOM for systems review; and we also discussed at length any possible issue that may arise from this failure. The main issue of concern that the landing gear may not extend normally and manual gear extension maybe necessary. We conducted a system review and discussed our plan of action should SYS A completely fail. Upon starting our descent; LOW PRESSURE light for ENG Driven pump for engine #2 Illuminated. QRH was accomplished. Since we were faced with possibility of a dual HYD SYS loss; we made a decision to divert to ZZZ2. ATC was notified; priority handling was requested; and we were given vectors for ZZZ2. Once establish on final; we decided to lower the gear at approximately 10 mile final; to give us more time to address any issues should the gear fail to extend. Approach and landing were uneventful. We exited the runway and stopped on a high-speed taxiway. ARFF personnel observed fluid leaking from number one engine. At that point both engines were shut down; inspection by ARFF was completed; and we were pulled to the gate by a super tug.,B737 First Officer reported the loss of both Engine Driven Hydraulic Pumps in flight. Faced with the possibility of a dual hydraulic system loss; the flight crew elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

Conditions were smooth and expected smooth on the arrival. Passenger seat belt sign was on and Flight Attendants were out of their seats and performing normal duties. The First Officer asked Washington Center what kind of aircraft we were behind on the arrival; and approach informed us it was Aircraft X. We asked to slow down to 250 and felt a little more wake and then asked for vectors off course on the arrival. The First Officer then called the Flight Attendants who were okay but were jolted by the wake turbulence. We increased spacing with Aircraft X and continued to a normal visual approach and landing. The Flight Attendants did not require medical attention. The D position was done with her trip and went home. The A; B; and C were going to continue flying another flight. Two of the Flight Attendants; I think the B and C; mentioned their backs hurt but that they could keep flying and would be okay. No passengers were injured.,B737-800 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence descending into BWI in trail of a B767.

We noted a right generator drive light; followed shortly thereafter by an ENG FAIL indication above the right engine EGT. At that point I allocated job duties. FO (First Officer) fly and talk on the radios. I ran the QRC; which led us to an engine failure shutdown. Briefly did a drift down checklist. Conducted an engine failure non-normal. Attempted a relight per the checklist via engine inflight start; crossbleed start. No EGT rise. Checklist had us shut the engine down. We diverted to ZZZ and landed safely with no further issues on the ILS XXL. Prior to deferred Items the Captain coordinated with Dispatch; [and] flight attendants via procedures and PA. Landed safely. The FO did a fantastic job flying and communicating with ATC.,B737 Captain reported receiving a Master Caution light; a right generator drive light; and a right engine failure; and proceeded to divert to another airport.

During cruise flight at (estimated) XA45Z the autopilot disengaged because of a #1 IRU failure. This caused my attitude indications and nav indications to disappear from my display screens. I immediately transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer who became the Flying Pilot for the remainder of the flight. I proceeded to perform the ECAM actions; which were minimal; other than noting failures and clearing the items on the ECAM display. The normal procedure for recovering flight instruments is to place the ATT HDG control on the Switching Panel to CAPT 3. But because the #3 IRU was inoperative; this action did nothing. After finishing the ECAM actions I advised ATC that we had a flight control problem and that we needed to descend to a lower altitude (to clear RVSM airspace) and that we would get back to them when able. We were given clearance to FL260 but decided to level at FL280 after it was offered by ATC. I was unable to contact Dispatch via the Crew Phone application on my iPad because I did not have WIFI capability. I assume this was because of the double IRU failure; but I have not confirmed this assumption. We were too far east of the ZZZ1 area Dispatch Direct VHF Network; so I spent a few minutes locating the appropriate communications frequency for our location in order to get a phone patch to the Flight Dispatcher. After explaining the situation to Dispatch; we decided that a diversion to ZZZ2 would be the safest course of action. We then advised ATC of our plan and proceed to ZZZ2 airport. As a result of the loss of 2 IRU units; the inoperative aircraft systems were Autopilot; Auto Thrust; Flight Directors; and Yaw Damper #1. The weather for the entire flight; from failure to landing; was VMC. We did not have navigation ability; so we were given radar vectors all the way to the localizer for Runway XXR at ZZZ2. We decided not to request priority handling for this situation as we felt the aircraft was fully controllable; the weather was good; and a normal landing was anticipated. The flight landed without further problems and proceeded to park normally at the assigned gate. An IRU failure on its own would not have caused any significant problems or the necessity to divert. However because of the inoperative #3 IRU; this became a much more problematic situation. I do not know the reason for the failure of the #1 IRU so I have no insight as to the causal factors beyond the application of an MEL to the #3 IRU. I believe this was a very rare occurrence. The failure of a second IRU unit is obviously considered a low probability event. Otherwise the MEL application would not be approved. I do not have any suggestions on how to prevent this type of event in the future.,A321 Flight Crew reported the failure of the #1 IRU after departure. #3 IRU was already on MEL. After running the checklists and QRH; the flight crew communicated with Dispatch. The decision was made to divert and land.

After requesting priority handling; we followed the CABIN ALTITUDE procedure and deployed the O2 to the Passengers. I believe I asked for a descent to the lowest safe altitude and were cleared to 12;000 ft. We were not far from ZZZZ so I knew we would not be held above 10;000 ft. for very long due to the mountains in the area. I asked the FB (First Officer B) to run a non-normal overweight landing assessment.As I was completing the overweight landing checklist; the checklist indicated we needed to do a flaps 25 landing. However; the landing assessment indicated we needed to do a flaps 20 landing. This is where the confusion for me and the FO started....Both of us firmly believed that all overweight landings were done at flaps 20 yet the checklist indicated flaps 25.... Our belief was supported by the landing assessment completed by the FB from the 'non-normal' section of the landing app as I had instructed him to do.Not having any resolution with the conflicting information; I decided to complete the approach using flaps 20 since it provided a better margin of safety if a go around would have been necessary with one or two engines operating. This airport has terrain in proximity and the runway in use has an 'Engine failure Procedure' missed approach. Considering all of this; I was satisfied to continue the approach and landing at flaps 20...We held over the airport for a couple turns to complete our checklists then commenced our approach to XXR. 		Once we cleared the runway; we stopped on the inner taxiway so the Fire Chief could give us his report. Our Company Mechanic was the liaison to communicate with the Fire Chief...He used turbo fans to cool the gear then offered to hose off the landing gear with water. I did not know if water was appropriate with the gear as hot as it was so I asked Local Maintenance and Maintenance in ZZZ through the Sat-phone if I should give the Fire Chief the go-ahead. 	They offered no guidance. So I agreed with the Chief and they commenced with watering the hot landing gear down.I asked the FB to refer to the Brake Cooling chart in the QRH to get a time for cooling which was about 85 minutes. While we sat there five tires flattened out.Coordination with our Maintenance; Operations and Dispatch in ZZZ all worked well to see to our needs. Air stairs were provided along with busses to transport everyone to the terminal. I held everyone on the plane until the gear temperatures were in a safe range... Some of the difficulties with this event included communications with the Controller I was talking to initially at the start of the event. Her English was fine but the quality of her radio was horrible. I remember asking her a half a dozen times to repeat her clearance because we couldn't understand her. Day 0. XA15 ZAfter I submitted this report; the review page had errors.. The nose number should be Aircraft X. I don't know the tail number offhand.. The aircraft type is 777-300.Day 0 0XA21 ZThe date of the event... in Zulu time was Day 0.With regard to the pressurization issue; Maintenance will make the determination as to why it happened. I flew this aircraft a week earlier. When I showed up to the aircraft to begin that sequence; the cockpit was filled with Mechanics trying to clear three status messages. I believe they were for both Outflow Valves and one for Cabin Altitude. Regarding the procedures for the overweight landing... Having time to review the events; the biggest distraction for my decision making was my preconceived notion that flaps 20 is the setting for an overweight landing. My First Officer (FO) had the same perspective. Now having reviewed the procedure; I see that the flaps 20 landing is tied to a single engine landing and not a two engine landing. During our annual training we go through this exercise and it is always tied to an engine failure. I think this is why my convection for insisting on using flaps 20 was so strong. Adding to that; I asked the FB for a non-normal landing assessment which is the; Flaps 20 landing (overweight; etc.) failure.... Located in the non-normal category in the landing app. This also supported my decision for a flaps 20 landing...It is obvious now that it was the wrong place to go for that information. Using the Normal landing assessment for this abnormal situation was the place to go. Reviewing all of this in the aftermath of this event; it is obvious that flaps 25 was the appropriate flap setting.Some of the abnormal procedures as they are written are difficult to understand. In the heat of the moment; there were a couple of decision questions that I couldn't understand. Now after a careful review; I have a better understanding of this procedure but in the heat of the moment it was very confusing. Suggestions:Complete understanding of the checklist procedures.,Flight Crew reported loss of Cabin Pressure Control in climb. The Cabin Altitude climbed above 12;500 ft. and the O2 masks were deployed. The Flight Crew requested priority handling and immediately descended. The Flight Crew preformed an air turn back and made an overweight landing at departure airport.

When it was obvious we were going to be landing at either ZZZ3 or ZZZ2; I advised my FO (First Officer) to come out of VNAV and use the speed brake to hasten our descent.The FO and I had conversation regarding ZZZ2 versus ZZZ3. FO pointed out that ZZZ2 was closer and fulfilled criteria as alternate airport - plus; weather was excellent; and a 12;000 ft. runway. FO coordinated with ATC for ZZZ2 and changed destination in FMC. FO was flying the aircraft and handling ATC; I ran the engine failure checklist and got to point where we had to analyze engine. We both saw no N2 rotation. I made call to Dispatch and got Maintenance Control on the line.Maintenance Control ran through what we had and I wanted confirmation that we were not to restart as zero N2. Maintenance Control thought that with oil quantity normal we should have a restart attempt. We ran restart checklist as embedded in the ENG FAIL R checklist but after 3 minutes; still no restart so I made decision to complete shut down and make a southeast Flaps 20 landing into ZZZ2.At this point we briefed the ILS XX approach into ZZZ2 and I made a PA to the passengers and a briefing to the FAs (Flight Attendant). I decided to land the aircraft as FO was still less than 100 hours; plus on probation. We transferred the controls; ran the descent checklist; and was then vectored for a southeast ILS to [Runway] XX. We landed at approximately XB:48. Approach and landing were normal and we taxied to Gate XX followed by Crash Rescue; who confirmed no FOD or debris from our aircraft. We parked at Gate XX and managed to get a jetway close enough to deplane the aircraft. ZZZ2 staff were excellent in handling the unusual situation and air carrier X was able to find another 777 to bring from ZZZ4 to ZZZ2 to get passengers to ZZZ1.,B777 flight crew reported receiving an EICAS message of the right engine malfunctioning during cruise flight. After consulting with Dispatch and Maintenance; the flight crew diverted to an alternate airport.

A little over an hour into the flight we were level at FL370; talking to ZZZZ Center; and the Relief Pilot was on first break. It was at this time the Captain and I felt a jolt; the airplane began to yaw; and a significant vibration began. We looked at the engine instruments and determined we had lost thrust on the Number 1 Engine with a rising EGT of 692 degrees at the time. The Captain was the Pilot Flying so they took control of the aircraft and called for the QRC and the Engine Fire; Severe Damage; Separation Checklist. After completing the appropriate QRC and Non-Normal checklists we [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center; requested FL250 (drift down ALT was 26700 ft. @ 244 kts); and decided to divert to ZZZZ1. At this point the Relief Pilot was back in the cockpit and the Captain delegated duties for them and myself to go over the checklists one more time; contact the Flight Attendants (FAs); contact Dispatch; monitor cross-feeding fuel; and set ourselves up for our approach into ZZZZ1. We had no center tank fuel so we did not dump fuel and our landing weight was 300;000 lbs. below maximum landing weight. We requested the ILS to Runway XX with an alternate missed approach of straight out runway heading and up to 3000 ft. Our arrival; approach; and landing were uneventful. After landing we stopped on the runway and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Personnel inspect the exterior of the aircraft; especially our Number 1 Engine. Once they gave us the all clear we taxi to the gate without any issue.,B767 flight crew reported a #1 Engine Failure in cruise followed by significant vibration. The flight crew diverted to make a precautionary landing.

He then looked up at the overhead panel and noticed that there was a disagreement in the lights. We the initiated a go around and ran the checklist in the QRH for a slat/flap disagreement. The checklist called for a flap 15 landing. We [requested priority handling] with Tower and requested an approach into Runway XX where the Captain made a successful landing.,B737 Captain reported the Slat/Flap Amber Light Illuminated on approach. The flight crew performed a go-around and landed at destination airport.

Completed the ECAM procedures; checked for follow up in QRH; contacted dispatch/maintenance to discuss best course of action. I decided that a divert to ZZZ was required. Aircraft would have only single reverser; 40% of ground spoilers would not work; and nose wheel steering would be inoperative after landing. I chose ZZZ because it has long runways; and I knew my landing distance would be affected by the failures. The diversion was made; the landing was completed. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was on scene and looked over the aircraft. We were then hooked to a super tug to be towed to the gate. While crossing the boundary from Ground Control to Ramp Control; the escort vehicle leading the tug stopped at the ramp entrance; and the tug carrying the aircraft was unable to stop and hit the escort vehicle. No damage was noted by me; and I believe the collision speed was less than 1 mph. Upon arrival at the gate the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML) was filled out for the yellow hydraulic failure; and the collision with the ground vehicle. Approximately one minute after I received an ECAM for the low hydraulic level; the flight attendant called me to notify me that we had a passenger that was having an 'anxiety attack'. There was weather in the ZZZ1 area and we had light to moderate turbulence for approximately 40 minutes during the climbout. This was also my First Officer's first trip off OE as a new hire pilot. Several causal factors played a role in the event. 1) Widespread convective activity in the ZZZ1 area gave us a pretty rough ride; which was concerning enough for at least one passenger to become distressed. This did not have any relevance to the rest of the event except that it was distracting to deal with during the course of the event. 2) New hire FO. This trip was the First Officer's first trip off OE at Airline X. The event occurred on the third leg of the trip. He is an experienced pilot from Airline Y and did a fantastic job. 3) Dispatch/Maintenance. In making my decision to divert to ZZZ; I contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control to confer about the issues. Dispatch told me that operationally; they would've preferred the aircraft to be in ZZZ2. I decided to divert to ZZZ because I could not justify flying for another two hours; and then [request priority handling] because of the landing distance issues. 4) After landing process. I had let Dispatch and Maintenance know the nature of the [problem]; and that we would need to be towed off of the runway to the gate. After ARFF looked over the aircraft; Maintenance showed up in a pick up truck with gear pins and were told that they just needed to pin the gear and I would taxi to the gate. I informed them that I had no nose wheel steering and I would have to be towed with a tug. The whole event from landing; to getting a tug; to removal from the runway took approximately 20 to 30 minutes because the tug was not waiting for us when we landed. This tied up the runway in ZZZ while they were doing instrument approaches. To me it just seemed like there wasn't adequate coordination done before we got there.I don't believe that there is anything that could've been done to resolve the hydraulic issue; but I do have some observations about things that may be would've been helpful. 1) I've been involved with two [priority handling requests] in the last six months and it doesn't seem to me that Dispatch is much of a resource. I generally have the expectation that I'm calling them to help me with my issue; but I think that I've learned that I need to have a course of action decided and just tell them what I'm going to do. 2) When we arrived at the gate; there was a slew of people in the jetway to meet us; the ARFF event commander; in-flight coordinator; etc. I never got a chance to talk to the tug driver because he had unplugged and driven off and was gone to his next assignment before I got a chance to thank him or discuss the event. The collision was not his fault; and I wanted to let him know that but to also let him know that it had to go in the AML. 3) The Flight Attendants were gone before I ever got a chance to thank them or debrief them. They elected not to continue with their trip and went home; I think in the future I will make sure that I get the opportunity to debrief everybody; but I was so busy talking to ARFF; mechanics; etc. that I never got the chance. 4) I have decided that in the future; if I have to [request priority handling]; once we land; the trip will be over for me. I agreed to swap aircraft and fly the remainder of the flight and passengers to ZZZ2; because crew scheduling told us that once we got to ZZZ2; we would be done and could go to the hotel for the night. Enroute; they reassigned us to an additional leg after we got to ZZZ2. I was to deadhead on the flight to ZZZ; and my First Officer was to fly it. This makes for a very exhausting day when the first leg was a [priority handling event] and erodes the safety margin. The First Officer told me that at Airline Y; it is policy that if you [request priority handling] you are done and are removed from the rest of the trip. Being a new hire on his first trip with Airline X; he didn't have the choice not to do the leg. I will not allow that to happen again.,Air carrier flight crew reported hydraulic system malfunction in cruise flight.

I was the pilot flying; so I told Person A that I had the radios and asked them to run the associated Non-normal Checklist. I was not familiar with this malfunction; but it became immediately clear that there was a possibility that we may have to shut down the engine. I asked Person A to hold on for a second and I transmitted to ATC that we wanted to level off at FL190 in order to work a possible engine problem and that I would get back to them with more information shortly; which was approved as requested. Realizing the possible severity of the situation and the possibility of some very challenging checklists ahead; I decided to swap roles and have Person A fly and run the comms; while I ran the associated checklists for the problem. I started the checklist; which called for turning off the autothrottle and retarding the engine until either the message goes out or it is at idle. I coordinated this with Person A so that they could smoothly apply the needed rudder to compensate for the loss of thrust; which went very smoothly all the way to idle with the message still illuminated. I then knew we were going to shut down the engine; so I took the radios back and with ATC; told them we were returning to ZZZ and needed a turn back toward the airport; and would like to enter a holding pattern in order to run the checklists; and that I would get back to them shortly with the rest of their required information. I then sent a CALL ME message to Dispatch and; while I awaited their reply; I called the Purser and asked them to get out their device because I needed to give them the briefing. They got out the device and I told them that we had to shut down an engine; we are not planning an evacuation; there are no special instructions; we would be returning to ZZZ and landing in about 15 minutes; and that I would make an announcement to the passengers soon.I then called Dispatch on the frequency I was sent; but the transmission was broken and unreadable; so I sent a DIVERT message with a quick note about shutting down an engine and returning to ZZZ. I then went to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist and secured the engine accordingly; turned on the APU for power; and called ATC back with fuel and souls onboard and asked them for a lower altitude. They gave us 12;000 ft.; which caused us to have to use engine anti-ice during the descent; which I selected on for the operational engine. During this time they were vectoring us in an extended holding type pattern. I decided this was a good time to brief the passengers. In a calm voice; I told them that we had to shut down one of our engines; we would be returning to ZZZ; please follow all instructions from the flight attendants; and that I would talk to them on the ground shortly.I then continued to the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist down to the items including the Non-normal Configuration Landing Distance table for our aircraft. We were well below max landing weight for the 900ER. At this point; I checked in with Person A to make sure they were ok and on board with everything that we had done up to that point; which they were. I decided to quickly type a more detailed message to Dispatch stating that we had in fact shut down the Left Engine and would be landing in ZZZ soon; to which they replied that everyone had been advised and that we should return to Gate XXX.I then got landing data for [Runway] XYR; loaded and briefed the ILS including the complex procedure for that runway; adjusted the target speed on the FMS approach page; and since we were in heading mode on vectors; I extended the runway centerline off of ZZZZZ1 with a 284 inbound course. I asked Person A if they wanted to also brief the approach because they were going to be flying it; but they were satisfied with everything I had set up for the approach. I then asked for lower so that we could run the Deferred Items Checklist. When we got below 10;000 ft.; I configured the bleed panel; reviewed the flaps 1 go-around with the procedure; and told ATC we were ready for the approach. We were given a vector to intercept the XYR localizer; and since were over 25 miles from the airport; I told Person A that we would need to use LNAV until we were closer in for a better localizer signal. As we rolled wings level; I went to select LNAV but realized the FMS had re-sequenced and the final course was off of the FAF and the magenta line was not far enough out for us to intercept. As I was correcting this problem; we got a TA for an aircraft below us. My immediate concern was that we may have overshot the final approach course; so I told Person A to initiate a right turn and spun the heading bug about 15 degrees right. It turned out that we had not overshot the final and the traffic was just someone climbing out below us and leveling 1;000 ft. below our altitude. I finished extending the centerline off of ZZZZZ1 and rejoined the final. At around 15 miles out we selected approach mode and started configuring for landing. Reaching flaps 15; I ran the Landing Checklist and we proceeded to land uneventfully and taxied to the gate. I thanked the passengers for their understanding and cooperation; then called Dispatch and the Chief Pilot.,B737 Captain reported an Oil Filter Bypass Light caution message appeared while climbing that required an engine shutdown as part of the checklists. The flight crew then performed an air turnback.

We were in the middle of a lav break and when I returned; the First Officer (FO) stated that we had an Engine Stall and Ignition Indication on the ECAM during my absence that quickly disappeared. We then noticed that the #1EGT was quickly approaching Red Line. It fluctuated a couple of times and then gave us an Engine Failure ECAM. We [requested priority handling]; complied with the ECAMs; diverted to ZZZ and completed a safe landing. It was an extremely busy time between running the checklists; communicating with ATC; Dispatch; Flight Attendants and the passengers. There was a lot to accomplish in a short period of time and easy to get off task. We also received other ECAMs which created confusion; such as FUEL Indicating System Fault. ATC was extremely helpful but asked a lot of questions at a critical time. I was able to reload the box; the FO directed the airplane towards ZZZ; we completed the checklists and successfully flew the ILS XX. Once on the ground; Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspected the aircraft; gave us an all clear and we taxied to the gate. All passengers deplaned via the jet way.,A319 Captain reported Engine Failure ECAM in flight. The flight crew ran the QRH and check lists; then requested priority handling. The flight crew diverted and made a precautionary landing.
1974630,202302,1801-2400,US,Air Carrier,Passenger,A320,Climb,Air Conditioning and Pressurization Pack,Captain; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP); Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Multiengine,Workload,Aircraft Equipment Problem Critical; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Weight And Balance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Maintenance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural MEL / CDL; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural Clearance; Deviation / Discrepancy - Procedural FAR,Automation Aircraft Other Automation; Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Air Traffic Control Provided Assistance; Flight Crew Requested ATC Assistance / Clarification; Flight Crew Landed in Emergency Condition; Flight Crew Diverted; General Flight Cancelled / Delayed; General Maintenance Action,Human Factors; Aircraft,Aircraft,"Upon arrival at the aircraft 65 minutes before departure time; we noticed that Pack 1 had just been placed on MEL due to recurring Pack 1 Regulator faults. While allowed per MEL; I do not like to fly over water on one pack; especially at night; and even more so when it's the first flight on a single pack. So I contacted Operations Control via Dispatch to ask for a different aircraft. Operations Control said none were available. I also emailed the Duty Chief Pilot for assistance but they never got back to me before departure time. I considered refusing the aircraft; but the FO (First Officer) and I chose not to. We planned to monitor the pressurization system more closely; knowing it was degraded. We boarded and departed on time. Initial climb-out was uneventful. Passing 10;000 ft.; we took a close look at the pressurization parameters and all looked normal. We continued to climb to FL290. We were busy in the climb conducting the numerous procedures required for Class II operations. After a few minutes at FL290 we were cleared to climb to FL330.As we initiated the climb; the Lower ECAM switched to the PRESS page and displayed the Cabin Altitude Advisory; flashing at 8;800 ft. and climbing. I pushed the V/S knob to level off at approximately FL294. It appeared that with Pack 1 OFF per MEL; our one remaining pack was 'weak' and not able to fully pressurize the aircraft. We noted the outflow valve was closed. No ECAM cautions or warnings were present.Since the cabin altitude continued to climb even while level at FL294; I directed the FO to request an immediate descent to 10;000 ft. ZZZ Center cleared us right away to descend and maintain 10;000 ft. I selected 10;000 ft. in the FCU (Fuel Control Unit) and began an open descent. At this point the cabin altitude indicated above 9;550 ft. and turned red; so I proactively announced emergency descent"" even though the cabin altitude was still below 10;000 ft. The FO read the QRC checklist and I began a descent with autopilot off and spoilers fully extended. At the same time I stated out loud; 'We need to go back to ZZZ.' The FO advised ATC of our descent and the desire to return to ZZZ. We were additionally cleared to turn right direct ZZZ. Once the descent was established; we began the right turn towards ZZZ. I noticed no traffic at all within 20 NM of the aircraft during the descent and turn back via TCAS on ND (Navigation Display); and out the windows. I selected Terrain on ND to ensure we were over water as expected. It was a pitch black night with no horizon or visual cues.As we descended; the cabin altitude continued to climb above 9;550 ft. but at a slower rate. Then approximately halfway through the descent; the Master Warning sounded as the cabin altitude reached 10;000 ft. Shortly thereafter the cabin began to descend as the aircraft got lower. I recall the cabin was only 100 - 200 ft. above 10;000 ft. for approximately 20 seconds. We did not don oxygen masks when the cabin altitude reached 10;000 ft. due to the high workload of hand-flying the descent on instruments and the transient nature of the excessive cabin altitude. We felt the priority was on maintaining safe control of the aircraft. A320 FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) 1 paragraph 5.1.2 states; ""the pilot flying will be tasked with verifying the non-normal condition and confirming procedures… (but) it should not distract the pilot flying from his primary duty of safely flying the aircraft."" However upon reflection; if the situation was progressing to the point where I thought declaring ""emergency descent"" was warranted; putting on our oxygen masks before beginning the descent would have been the better course of action. Upon leveling at 10;000 ft. we slowed to 250 kt.; re-engaged the autopilot; verified we were navigating direct to ZZZ as cleared; and assessed the situation. The cabin altitude was below 10;000 ft. and cabin vertical speed was at -250 FPM; descending. In fact as we transited back at 10;000 ft.; the cabin continued to descend normally and reached field elevation before we landed. We heard no unusual sounds indicating a leak of any kind. I next called the cabin to advise them of the situation and to check in on the cabin condition. They said everything was okay and the oxygen masks did not deploy. I told the F1 we were returning to ZZZ; landing in about 25 minutes. I said the landing would be normal but CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) may meet the aircraft. Next; we advised Dispatch via ACARS of our descent and plan to return to ZZZ. We initially set up the FMS for a return to ZZZ and ran the Overweight Landing Checklist. Planned landing weight was 154;000 lb. I then asked Dispatch if they preferred we go to ZZZ or ZZZ1; in case one was better than the other for our situation. Dispatch told us Operations Control preferred we go to ZZZ1 to facilitate an easier tail swap. We coordinated with ZZZ Center to divert to ZZZ1 and we reprogrammed the FMS again for ZZZ1. I continued to fly the aircraft and talk with ATC while the FO reprogrammed the FMS both times. ATC [provided priority handling] for us due to the descent; diversion; and planned overweight landing; and we concurred. I advised the flight attendants of our new plan to go to ZZZ1 and asked them to make a PA since we were in a descent below 10;000 ft. at this point and our workload was very high. The rest of the descent; approach and landing; ILS XXR ZZZ; were normal. Medium brakes were used per [the] software and max reverse per the Overweight Landing Checklist. Touchdown was in the touchdown zone at 200 FPM or less. ZZZ emergency equipment was dispatched to a location near the runway but they never approached the aircraft. We exited [Runway] XXR at [Taxiway] XX and taxied to [Taxiway] XY Gate XX normally.Brake fan use was delayed until brake temperatures reached 400°C on the left main gear; approximately 4 minutes after landing. Winds were 320 at 16 kt. for landing on [Runway] XXR. Brake temperatures never went much above 400°C and then began to cool. At the gate we wrote up the loss of pressurization and overweight landing. We debriefed Maintenance Control crew members face-to-face. We never ran the 'Diversion' checklist since both ZZZ and ZZZ1 are primary and well-known cities - we prioritized other necessary tasks. I provided the flight attendants all the information required for an event but I believe I may have failed to speak the words 'event' directly. The flight attendants confirmed with me after the flight that it was clear to them that it would be an event/normal landing.""",A320 Captain reported the cabin was not pressurizing properly and the flight crew opted to divert. The aircraft had a pack that was on MEL; leaving only one pack available for use on the flight.

The flight was part of a [flight with a Check Airman] sequence. All appropriate checklists were completed and the aircraft returned to ZZZ for a successful; but overweight; landing. The biggest additive condition that occurred during this event was due to the multitude of requests for information from Dispatch during high workload times. Before we even had the chance to assess the engine condition; balance our response and communicate with ATC; there were 2 ACARS messages from Dispatch; followed by further requests; while we were executing the QRH Checklist; including the question; 'Did you [request priority handling]?' Once on the ground; ZZZ Operations and Dispatch were asking for information; while we were coordinating with the Airport Fire Response teams; ATC for a place to wait while the brakes cooled; and dealing with the passengers to set their expectations. All of these requests should have waited until the aircraft was at the gate.In a [situation] like this; requests for information; unless directly associated with ensuring a successful outcome; should be kept until the more immediate necessity of safely getting the aircraft on the ground has been accomplished. The numerous requests for information are an additive and task loading condition that the crew does not need while executing the QRH procedure. While I understand the need for information in the Company Operations Center; none of the requests were helpful to the crew. Dispatch pushing the weather and gate info to us via ACARS; plus a request to call when able would have helped. A checklist of who to contact would be helpful AFTER the aircraft is shut down; the passengers and crew are taken care of; and the crew has a chance to recover.,B737-800 flight crew reported the #1 Engine failed during the climb and proceeded to shut down the affected engine. The flight crew then performed an air turnback.

I (Captain) elected to continue flying and the FO (First Officer) ran the ECAM and QRH procedures. I requested priority handling; requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting); and asked for vectors off the approach because the situation and communication with Tower left us too high to continue the approach. The FO completed the ECAM and QRH follow-ups; I briefed the FA's (Flight Attendant) (precautionary landing) and the Passengers. We landed without incident; stopped on the runway; and had ARFF inspect the aircraft. We requested ARFF follow us to the gate and parked.Cause - The only unusual item was that ARFF did not have VHF capability; so all communication with them was through Tower relay.,A321 flight crew reported a compressor stall followed by a failure and auto shutdown of the right engine on final. The flight crew asked for vectors to discontinue the approach. Priority handling was requested and the flight crew ran the QRH and checklists. The flight crew reentered the approach and landed at destination airport.

Observed #2 fuel quantity increase +/- 500 lbs. based on observations we did not suspect fuel leak. FMC annunciations of using reserve fuel; followed by insufficient fuel. Observed #1 engine fuel imbalance. Discussed situation with Operations Control/Maintenance Control and diverted to ZZZ at Dispatch's request. Briefed cabin and passengers. Observed at lower altitude fuel remained balanced but additional FMC messages of insufficient fuel. Observed structural landing weight limit 129.2 lbs. Uneventful landing and termination. Worked with station to disembark passengers into terminal. Communicated with Operations Control and contract maintenance. Contract maintenance was not familiar with aircraft or procedures to diagnose. Maintenance Control was unable to determine the cause of the indication problems and FMC messages. Trip reassigned to reserve crew and departed ~ 11 hours later with a MEL.,B737 Captain reported a Fuel Imbalance at top of climb. The flight crew ran the QRH and checklists. After conferring with Operations and Maintenance; the flight crew elected to divert and make a precautionary landing.

All the associated malfunctions with a loss of the number one engine occurred. The Captain started to manually fly the aircraft and I proceeded to get vectors back to the field. The Captain eventually got the autopilot back on and handed me the aircraft and they proceeded to run the engine failure checklist and the one engine inoperative landing checklist. They contacted Dispatch and communicated with the Flight Attendants and notified the passengers. We briefed up the approach and proceeded on a vector to XXR. During a flight director anomaly we overshot the course slightly and had not begun our descent (waiting to be established) and opted to go-around since we were high. We wanted the most stable approach as possible. Flew around the radar pattern and landed without any issues. Taxied clear and the Captain had them check our brakes before we taxied to the gate. The rest was uneventful.,B737 First Officer reported an engine rolled back at approximately FL210 during climb out. The pilots returned to the departure airport where the first approach was unsuccessful requiring a go around and finally resulting in a second successful approach.

Originally in the climb; we were monitoring ENG 2 because the oil level started flashing and we received an advisory. Then once we began to level and accelerate; ENG 1 went into a compressor stall and starting surging with multiple loud bangs. The FAs (Flight Attendants) called reporting flames coming from ENG 1. We immediately [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ on Runway XXL. We landed overweight at roughly 149;000lbs without any further event.,First Officer reported an engine stall during initial climb. Flight crew performed an air turn back and landed at departure airport.

Captain was informed by Maintenance that the following items failed at Cruise.Autoflight System (AFS): FMGC2 64 AFS 1 Electronic Instrument System (EIS) 2; IR2; IR3; IR1; EIS1AFS: FMGC1 61. AFS 1 IR3; IR1; EIS1; EiS2 IR2CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULTFMGC2 (1CA2) BUS FM2/DMC2 (1WT2). EIS2The above failures began at 28;000 ft. approximately 150-180 miles from ZZZZ. The first indication of any problem was an auditory triple click; followed by GPS Primary lost on both the Captain and First Officer's (FO's) displays. What followed next was an ECAM action to set manual field elevation. I was Pilot Flying and verbalized my aircraft; my radios. At the same time Captain began to run the ECAM actions.Following ECAM actions; it was evident that we were having navigation issues. The primary flight plan and secondary flight plans were gone. While the Captain with his 19 years of Airbus experience worked diligently to re-establish a flight plan; I let ATC know of our issues and requested vectors and a lower altitude.The Captain was able to establish a partial flight plan with ZZZZ as our destination. This allowed points and altitudes to appear back in our MFD. However the aircraft would not manage to any point; any altitude or airspeed. Thus resulting in using HDG; open Decent and manual speeds for the remainder of the arrival and approach.Not being able to arm an approach in either AP1 (Autopilot 1); or AP2 (Autopilot 2) a visual approach to landing was preformed. Approaching 500 ft. from touchdown with 1;100 ft. down on the VSI; Captain calmly said 'What do you think about a go around'? I said that sounds like a good idea your call. We did the go around according to the new procedures without event. After vectors for a downwind and base back to Runway XX and fully aware of the aircraft capabilities or lack thereof a visual approach was flown and successfully landed on Runway XX; making the high speed taxi way of X.The successful completion of the flight was made easier by the training received and the adherence to the SOP's established by company. The Captain set expectations the very first time I met him in ZZZ for the start of the sequence. These expectations along with good CRM and the experience of the Captain aided in the successful outcome of the flight. I believe that this was a computer failure in nature.,Flight Crew reported failures of numerous systems in cruise. The crew ran the QRH and check lists and reconstructed a flight plan and continued to destination airport. A go around was performed and the approach was accomplished again; allowing for a safe landing at destination airport.

We started both engines and taxied to Runway XXR. All check list and engine warmup time's completed. Takeoff roll was normal. After the gear was retracted we notice number two engine oil level was low and started blinking. Shortly after we noticed the white advisory message advising us of the oil. We discussed contacting maintenance once we passed 10;000 ft. And see what they had to say. Climbing out of 4;000 ft. We received violent bangs followed by massive yawing of the aircraft indicative of an engine failure. I immediately leveled the aircraft to get more airflow into the engine. At this point the number one engine had at least 3-5 massive compressor stalls followed by a rollback. My first officer (FO); who did an amazing job; advised ATC and started the ECAM procedures. We had numerous ECAM messages going off and of course flight attendants calling us nonstop due to the flames coming out of number one engine; rightfully so. I immediately started the APU and turned back towards ZZZ. The number two engine was still low on oil so my FO and I discussed the contingency for that situation as well. Once we leveled off; I started a slow decent with reduced power on number one. The compressor stalls stopped but the engine was running hot. Once we had every checklist completed and all the proper company stations called. We decided to make an overweight landing. On final we saw all the Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) was waiting for us. After completing all normal checklists; Fight Attendant briefing; passenger announcements and abnormal checklists; we felt it was time to land. We had plenty of fuel and a lot of time to make sure things were done correctly. Our aircraft weight was around 149;900 pounds when we touched down. We stopped the aircraft in the runway and called flight attended stations. CFR looked us over and noticed our brakes were pretty hot; but did not notice any engine damage or fire on the affected side. CFR told us to shut down both engines on the runway. After inspection I called over the PA to remain seated. We started number two and taxied to the gate with CFR in tow. No further actions were taken.,A320 Captain reported compressor stalls; engine rollback; and failure of the number one engine while climbing through 4;000 ft. just after departure. The flight crew requested vectors back to the field and accomplished a safe landing.

We were just above 10;000 ft. when the stall occurred. We leveled off; executed ECAM procedures. Upon retarding #2 Engine Throttle to idle; the loud banging and yawing subsided. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Approach and requested vectors for a return to ZZZ. We then briefed flight attendants; passengers; and Dispatch of our intentions. We returned to ZZZ with an uneventful; overweight landing on Runway XX. We landed at approximately 144;000 lb.,A319 flight crew reported compressor stalls occurred in Engine #2 during climb-out. The flight crew reduced the affected engine to idle power; which stopped the engine anomalies; and performed an air turnback.

We returned the gate. After maintenance checked out the engine and got the ice cleared from the engine we were able to push a second time and got a good start on both engines. We then proceeded to be deiced; and took runway XX in ZZZ. After rotation around 1;000-1;500 ft. we had an ECAM Message reading ENG 1 Thrust Reverser Fault with an amber LAND ASAP. There were zero other messages or steps to take. The Captain expressed he has experience in this situation and pulled number 1 engine to idle. I then activated autopilot. The captain then ran checklists and advised ATC. We were given vectors to return to runway XX at ZZZ. The Captain then called the Flight Attendants and gave them the required information for the situation. On downwind the Captain took flight controls and transferred ATC to me. In this high workload situation we briefly considered contacting operations but decided to wait till we were on the ground. After landing and stopped I found nothing in the QRH. The manual confirmed the ECAM messages were correct and only gave one step to take which was to pull the affected engine to idle. Which is what we did. The Captain performed his duties perfectly and in the event of an actual thrust reverser deployment at that phase of flight the actions of the Captain could have saved our lives.,A319 First Officer reported receiving an ECAM for ENG 1 Thrust Reverser Fault shortly after takeoff around 1;000 ft. The Captain set the affected engine to idle and the crew requested vectors for an immediate return to the departure airport.

ECAM Engine 1 Low Oil QTY displayed; directing us to shut engine down. We followed ECAM procedures and returned to ZZZ uneventfully using precautionary landing procedures.,A319 pilot flying reported receiving an Engine #1 Fire Loop fault followed by a decreasing Engine #1 Oil Quantity. The affected engine was shut down and the flight crew performed an air turnback.

We followed the Engine - Oil Bypass Light QRH. The Bypass Light went out with the Number 1 Engine at about 77% N1. The checklist says to confer with Dispatch and Maintenance about safest course of action.I sent a message to Dispatch; Call me;"" on Commercial Radio frequency. Dispatch quickly responded with a frequency; but we had to wait about 10+ minutes since another aircraft was handling a medical issue with a passenger. Once they were finally done and the frequency was clear; we were able to establish a phone patch with Dispatch and Maintenance. By this time; we were nearly over the top of ZZZ1.After explaining what happened; telling them the checklist we followed; and after having a brief discussion with Dispatch; Maintenance; and the FO (First Officer); we all agreed it was safe to continue to ZZZ2 as long as the Number 1 Engine parameters stayed within normal limits; and it did not need to be shut down. Maintenance suspected it was an instrumentation issue since we had oil pressure and oil temperature within normal limits. We all agreed it was not necessary to [request priority handling] with the Number 1 Engine operating at reduced thrust; so we did not do so at this point.I called the flight attendants to give a briefing. Person A answered. I told her; I need to give you a briefing. Her exact response was; ""But; I am right in the middle of my service."" I told her this was more important; and she put Person B on the phone. I had to repeat to Person B that I needed to give her a briefing; and she seemed better prepared for one - asking me to wait just a moment while she got ready to take notes on her link device.Once she was ready; I advised her that one of our engines was operating at reduced power because of an oil issue. It was still running; and we were still continuing to ZZZ2; but there was a chance we would divert with only 20+ minutes warning to the cabin if the engine performance significantly degraded. I told her we had about an hour to go; there was no need to prep for an evacuation; I had no special instructions; and I would update her if things changed.We reviewed the Engine Shutdown Checklist; kept the fuel balanced; checked the single-engine performance page of the FMC; and continued to monitor the engine. The Bypass Light reilluminated about every 3 - 5 minutes during flight and go out when the throttle was slightly reduced. Each time the N1 needed for the light to go out was a little lower. I sent a maintenance write-up and info report; logging the multiple N1 numbers when the Bypass Light came on; and what setting it went off. Per the Oil Bypass Light Checklist and our conversations with Dispatch / Maintenance; we continued towards ZZZ2. It appeared more likely that we would end up shutting down the engine; so I called the flight attendants and gave an updated briefing. I told her we were about 10 - 15 minutes of committed to continuing to ZZZ2; and to consider no news is good news on the need to divert. Fortunately; ATC needed a slower than normal speed from us; as we would not have been able to hold a fast; 0.78 mach or 300+ kt. if they needed it.We requested to descend early so the Number 1 Engine could operate at a further reduced setting. Just after the start of descent; the Oil Bypass Light came on again; and did not extinguish with the throttle at idle. The Oil Bypass checklist directed us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist. We followed the checklist; shut down the engine; advised Dispatch we were shutting down the engine; and about to [request priority handling]. After shutting down the Number 1 Engine; [requested priority handling] with ATC.After completing the checklist to the descent briefing portion; I did another briefing with the flight attendants and made a PA to the passengers. I did not have the flight attendants prepare the cabin for an evacuation - as we would be landing on a dry; long runway it did not seem necessary. In my view; ""Prepare the Cabin"" meant briefing the passengers on brace positions; and additional briefings with the passengers in the exit rows. Discussions with Person B after landing determined that she thought ""Prepare for Evacuation"" simply meant being more spring-loaded to evacuate herself; but no extra briefings of the passengers. There was obviously a big gap between what they think and what we think ""Prepare for Evacuation"" means in an immediate situation and this should be looked at and further addressed. I calmly told the passengers to expect a little faster than normal landing; they would see fire trucks follow us; and despite all this; we would still have them into ZZZ2 early; and I will see them at the gate. We had the checklist completed well before joining the approach to [Runway] XXL. We landed and fire / rescue confirmed there was no smoke / no evidence of abnormalities / no hot brakes before we taxied into the gate.""",B737 Flight Crew reported the Number 1 Engine Oil Bypass Light illuminated during the climb out. After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance; the decision was first made that the engine did not need to be shut down. However; as the flight continued to the destination and the Oil Bypass Light would not extinguish; the engine was then shut down.

We thought that there was a fuel leak because of the rapid fuel flow out of the left tank. The First Officer (FO) continued to fly the aircraft while I ran the Engine Fuel Leak QRH. We briefly discussed continuing straight to ZZZ1 but the weather was better in ZZZ and the rate of fuel loss out of the left side was very concerning to us. While I ran the QRH the FO [requested priority handling] and requested vectors back to ZZZ. The rapid loss led us to confirm a fuel leak in the QRH which led us to shutting down the number one engine. We continued to an uneventful single engine landing in ZZZ. After securing the engine we became aware the cross feed valve was open. I know I pointed at it in the QRH and verified it closed. I did not see a dim blue light and did not expect it to be open; because the only time it is open is when I open it. While we did discuss the issue at hand before delving into the QRC we felt a great urgency to act quickly due to the very rapid loss of fuel. A longer safety pause would have been more appropriate. The FO did a great job flying the plane and handling the radios but the approach environment is very distracting.I left the checklist to get ATC SOB count after we [requested priority handling]; and again to talk to the Flight Attendants (FAs) when they felt the plane turning around. Better managing distractions during critical junctures of the checklist would have gone a long way. I feel like I have good working knowledge of the 737 fuel systems; and know that one pump can overpower the others and the high power setting and fuel flow was the reason why the draw on the left side was so alarming. In retrospect there were a number of opportunities to trap this error before becoming an undesirable aircraft state. Fatigue may have been a contributing factor as this incident occurred on daylight savings day. I had a hard time falling asleep and woke up at XA:30 AM body time. My watch estimated my sleep for the night as 4 hours 13 minutes. I was tired that day and using caffeine to get me home. I have learned a lot from previous company guidance on this issue and never wanted to be the one to go down this rabbit hole. Look out for tunnel vision; confirmation bias; don't rush!,B737 Flight Crew reported a suspected Fuel Leak after takeoff. The Flight Crew ran the QRH and checklists and then requested vectors to return to the departure airport. The suspected Fuel Leak continued to worsen; so the Flight Crew requested priority handling and performed an in flight shut down. When complying with the inflight shutdown QRH; it was discovered that the Cross Feed Valve was still open. The flight crew continued to perform an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

They mentioned this to me and after I looked over and began to smell a burning smell that quickly intensified. I also noticed what appeared to be some haze potentially from smoke. The Captain retained control of the aircraft and we immediately donned our oxygen masks and I began working the QRC. We then had a frequency change and I checked in [to advise ATC]. The Controller tried to change our runway to XXL but we elected to land on XXR which we had previously briefed and to avoid adding to our workload. We landed without further incident and the fumes seemed to clear. The Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) evaluated our aircraft for hot spots which didn't exist and we taxied to the gate where they made further checks. After the event; Maintenance found a burned wire and also replaced the Captain PFD.,A320 flight crew reported a loss of the Captain's PFD and ND on final approach with an electrical smell and smoke noticeable in the cockpit. The flight crew donned O2 masks and continued to destination airport where a maintenance inspection discovered wiring issues.

We did not notice any noise from the extending gear and any speed reduction for the drag which should be occurring. At approximately 1400-1500 ft. we initiated a go-around (soft-go) and notified Tower we had an Unsafe Gear Indication. Tower instructed us to climb to 3000 ft.; runway heading. After the go-around the ECAM displayed landing gear gravity extension. I assigned the First Officer (FO); Pilot Flying and ATC duties; and that they should [request priority handling]. I began the Gravity Extension Procedure that just said to wait 120 seconds so I got the QRH out for the procedure and attempted to inform the Flight Attendants (FAs) but they didn't respond to my initial chimes. I also made a PA informing the passengers that we had gone around for a landing gear issue and would be working to extend the gear and that the aircraft would be getting loud with the gear extended. Before we returned to ZZZ; I proceeded with the QRH procedure for Gravity Extension and it was successful. We got 3 green lights and 3 green on the ECAM with the doors open. I then contacted the FAs and informed them that we had successfully lowered the landing gear; it was safe and locked and we would be returning to ZZZ for a precautionary landing. I then made another PA to the passengers also informing them that the landing gear was safe and locked and we were returning to land. We told ATC that we were ready to return and that we would be unable to clear the runway after landing and would require a tug. We then received radar vectors to final for Runway YYC and proceeded with a normal approach and landing to a full stop on the runway. I made a PA for everyone to remain seated and that Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles were going to be inspecting the aircraft.We did after landing and engine shut down checklist. We were then informed of an extended wait for the tug so I made a PA informing the passengers and told them that they could use the lavs but I would give 5 minute notice for when they needed to be seated. After the tug arrived; Maintenance installed all gear locks and tried for about 15-20 to raise the gear doors for tow; but were unsuccessful. We were then towed to the gate and completed aircraft shutdown. I want to acknowledge the performance of FO who did an outstanding job flying the aircraft and communicating with ATC allowing me to accomplish the checklist and inform the FAs and passengers of our progress; I was also impressed with the excellent job of FAs; when informed of our situation I appreciated their prompt understanding and knowledge.,A319 flight crew reported the landing gear failed to extend during final approach. The flight crew executed a go around; extended gear manually; and landed at destination airport.

I immediately took manual control of the aircraft and assessed the cause finding the left TRANSFER BUS OFF Annunciation accompanied by the Left SOURCE OFF Annunciation Illuminated. My copilot went to the QRH and we ran the TRANSFER BUS OFF checklist without success of regaining power to the associated bus. The procedure in this situation directs the pilots to land at the nearest suitable airport which in this case was our destination airport ZZZ. We [requested priority handling] and proceeded to ZZZ. The NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist was also run and the SOURCE OFF checklist was reviewed. Inside the final fix landing Runway XXL the smell of potential burning electrical became apparent. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was requested to be present on landing and the Flight Attendants were asked about the condition in the cabin where no smell was detected.The landing was uneventful and ARFF followed us to the gate as a precaution. We also directed the ground crew to stay away from the aircraft until ARFF had determined there were no hot spots within the aircraft. The Flight Attendant additionally reported after deplaning at the gate in ZZZ that earlier in the flight an oven had smelled of burning plastic and then shut off. This would have happened approximately one hour before the bus off event and was also reported to Maintenance. The crew did an excellent job of managing this mechanical event and maintaining passenger care throughout. When running the NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist I decided not to inform the Flight Attendants or the passengers of the situation as we were landing at our destination airport and no further assistance was anticipated. In hindsight I feel informing the Flight Attendants would have been prudent regardless of the fact a diversion was not required.,B737-800 Captain reported on initial descent; the Autopilot Disengaged in smooth air without warning and they could smell potential burning electrical equipment. The flight crew continued destination airport and landed.

The descent and approach were briefed per normal procedure. The FO (First Officer) was the pilot flying; PF; Captain was pilot monitoring; PM; there was no Jumpseater or other flight deck crew members present. The pre-departure briefing included duties in case of abnormal operations or emergency - PF would continue to fly the aircraft and take the radios; PM would run any required checklists. Go-around procedures were briefed during the descent briefing. The approach was planned as a normal ZZZ ILS XXR in visual; gusty-wind conditions.At approximately XA:00 on Day 0; the flight was approaching ZZZZZ - ZZZ ILS XXR final approach fix - at approximately 1;800 ft. AGL. As briefed; the FO called for gear extension and setting Flaps 15. The gear extension sounded normal at first. However; both pilots observed abnormal landing gear position light indications. The following indications were noted: All three green landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. All three green landing gear indicator lights on the aft overhead panel were illuminated. All three red landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. A single; unfamiliar; tone - beep - sounded briefly.Unsure of what may have caused the abnormal landing gear position indications and the unfamiliar tone - neither the PM nor the PF had heard this tone before - the PM suggested a go-around from the current altitude and the PF called for the go-around and started the procedures as briefed. ATC stated; Aircraft X; go around; runway heading; climb and maintain 3;000 ft."" The first ""half"" - i.e.; TOGA engagement; raising flaps to 15; which we were already positioned at; checking thrust; raising gear; [and] setting missed approach altitude - of the go-around was conducted normally. At this time; ATC started calling to ask about the reason for the go-around. This interrupted the go-around procedure. Approximately 30 seconds later as the aircraft was accelerating; the remaining procedures were accomplished - heading select; level change; setting clean maneuvering speed; raising flaps to 0; After-Takeoff Checklist. Allowing the ATC interruption and subsequent delay was pilot/crew error. However; the procedures were accomplished fully and safely.After go-around procedures were accomplished and the aircraft was overflying the ZZZ field; during the field overflight; the Tower reported that the aircraft's left main gear appeared to be extended while all other gear appeared retracted. All landing gear indicators on the flight deck appeared normal; i.e.; there were no red or green gear lights illuminated. The crew had no way to confirm whether or not the left main gear was extended. ATC queried the crew as to what airspace was required to resolve the issue. The PM requested vectors to remain in the local area and ATC vectored the flight west and directed a climb to 5;000 ft. MSL. The PF engaged the autopilot and maintained 230 KIAS via the MCP (Mode Control Panel) speed window.During the vector; the PF selected VNAV instead of continuing the LVL CHG climb. This caused the aircraft to start a brief descent while it attempted to recapture the cruise altitude in the FMC. The issue was identified by the PF; who disconnected the Autopilot and set the desired pitch attitude for the climb; followed by requesting re-engagement of LVL CHG; which was accomplished by the PM. The PF then re-engaged the Autopilot.The PM started to run NG Gear Disagree Checklist. The PF coordinated vectors with ATC and confirmed altitude and heading changes with the PM. While running the checklist; the PM: Step 1 - Landing gear lever is OFF. Step 2 - Landing gear lever moved to the UP position after takeoff; go-around. Step 3 - 235 KIAS maximum; landing gear lever: UP. Step 4 - All red and green landing gear indicator lights are extinguished. End of the checklist.PMthen determined that no additional resolution was available. We as a crew discussed if we should request priority handling; but it was decided that we had time and fuel 14;400 lb. left to continue to work on the problem. So we opted not to request priority handling at that time. However; ATC then asked us souls on board and fuel remaining; so we provided them with the information of SOB and 14;400 lb. of fuel remaining; or 144 minutes of flight time available. They essentially provided priority handling for us. Since we had no indication if our left main gear was still extended or not like the ZZZ Tower had told us it was; the crew then decided to contact a Company Ground Agency for any potential assistance or information they could provide. The PM contacted Company ZZZ Operations; who then directed us to contact Company ZZZ Maintenance. The Maintenance personnel suggested cycling the Manual Gear Extension Door located behind the FO on the floor open and closed as well as check for any popped circuit breakers. No additional resolution was gained as all landing gear indicator lights were still extinguished. While the PM was communicating with Maintenance; ATC contacted the PF and suggested the flight overfly ZZZ1 Airport; where Tower personnel could examine the gear positions with binoculars. The PF agreed and accepted vectors toward ZZZ1. When the PM was available; the PF briefed the PM on the plan to have ZZZ1 personnel visually inspect the gear. The PM agreed; then briefed the Purser; and made a short announcement to the passengers.Once the PM confirmed checklist usage complete; Maintenance agreed with the plan to overfly ZZZ1 and extend the gear. The PF accepted a descent to 2;000 ft. MSL and continued toward ZZZ1. Approaching ZZZ1; the PF extended the gear with PM concurrence. The aircraft was at 230 KIAS. The gear extension appeared normal; both in sound and landing gear light indicator illumination sequence. When complete; there were three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the instrument panel; three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the aft overhead panel; and zero red landing gear indicator lights illuminated. The aircraft overflew ZZZ1 at 2;000 ft. MSL and in a right turn toward the south. Through ZZZ Approach Control; ZZZ1 Tower personnel reported that all three landing gear appeared to be down. At this time Ground / Maintenance communications were called complete.With normal gear indications on the flight deck and visual confirmation from ZZZ1 Tower; the PF and PM decided that the gear would remain down for the remainder of the flight. At this point; the crew discussed and determined the following: All applicable checklists were run. Both flight crew members were comfortable moving into the approach / landing phase. The PF would continue to fly the aircraft. Call to Purser to rebrief the flight attendants on the situation and to NOT plan for an evacuation.The PF then requested and accepted vectors for the ZZZ ILS XXR. The PM reloaded the approach into the FMC and the PF called for the descent checklist. The localizer was intercepted between ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ. The remainder of the flight; including approach; landing; and taxi-in; were uneventful. During the approach; it was apparent that ATC; most likely Tower personnel; [provided us priority handling] and made Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles available. Additionally; on short final; ZZZ Tower personnel confirmed that all three gear appeared to be down. ARFF vehicles and equipment followed us to the gate area.After parking; shutting down the aircraft and conducting a short crew-only debrief - which focused on the go-around procedures and checklist usage - the flight crew was met by two ZZZ assistant chief pilots; Person A and Person B; and one Company Maintenance Representative. The flight crew was fully debriefed by Maintenance and [other] personnel. The PF entered an electronic logbook entry to document theevent.""",B737 NG Captain reported the landing gear extension and indicator lights had problems and was observed to be acting abnormally upon landing gear extension. The flight crew performed a go-around to troubleshoot and a decision was made to divert to another airport to do a fly-by for Tower to confirm landing gear position. After the landing gear was confirmed to be down; the flight crew returned to the original airport and safely landed.

Myself and another relief pilot were the relief pilots for the segment and in occupied the cockpit jumpseats during the event. On liftoff; R DRIVE and R GEN OFF illuminated. Captain acknowledged the message and calmly stated for the student to complete a normal takeoff profile and we would address the messages on climb out - an excellent decision and use of CRM. Once safely established on climb out; Captain started the APU (experience showing here) and was in the process to address the R side generator messages via checklist but the system RESET itself and all R side messages disappeared. A few short minutes later; the L DRIVE and L GEN OFF illuminated. Captain indicated this was unusual and it was likely we may need to return to ZZZZ. We began the process coordinating a hold with ATC to allow for proper system evaluation and checklist use as well as coordination with Dispatch & Maintenance. Established in the hold; Captain used the checklist - the Left side electrical messages persisted and; as a result; the L IDG DRIVE was disconnected via checklist command. After coordination with Company; we were informed that Maintenance independently received IDG/ GEN related messages on BOTH the right side as well as the left side generator systems - though we only had left side indications persist. Again; Captain's instincts proved correct. Captain; in agreement with the Dispatcher and pilot flight crew; came to the universal decision the safest course of action was a return to ZZZZ for inspection. Next Captain coordinated with ATC to provide for fuel dumping and the fuel dump checklist was actioned and; later; the overweight landing checklist was actioned. Captain coordinated with the flight attendants and informed the passengers of the return to ZZZZ. The IOE student had decent previous experience and was able to program the FMC and manage airspeed & configuration changes showing a high level of situational awareness. Captain delegated to the both relief pilots to verify landing performance and double check the diversion guidance from the flight manual. A normal approach and landing was made into ZZZZ and all appropriate electrical maintenance write-ups were completed. Having myself been an instructor in the regional airlines; I must add the calm manner of Captain allowed the student to excel in this environment and despite multiple EICAS messages - the flight was conducted in a deliberate; methodical; and safe fashion based on the leadership of Captain - an outstanding job.,B777 flight crew reported a mechanical problem with both engine generators during climb. The flight crew returned to the departure airport for an overweight landing.

The relieved crew reported to us that the First Officer (FO) side VOR/ILS was MEL'd. They said that they had to conduct a missed approach earlier in the day at ZZZ due to a loss of all ILS indicators on both sides. The flight mechanic had run a test in ZZZ that the Captain side system passed. We prepared the aircraft for our first leg to ZZZZ1 and departed around XB55L. The Captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and First Officer (FO) PM. During the climb as we passed through FL310 we observed a steady decrease in the #1 engine EGT. This decrease continued down to zero before the display blanked out. A few seconds later; the EGT gauge began to fluctuate erratically; ranging between zero and 1250 degrees Celsius. All other engine indications remained normal. We leveled off at FL310 and executed the memory items for the engine limit; surge; or stall checklist. Even with the #1 thrust lever closed; the EGT indications continued to act erratically.We began to work through the QRH checklist and elected to halt prior to shutting the affected engine down. This was due to the problem most likely being an indication issue and our location over the ocean. At this point; the aircraft was in LNAV/VNAV without the autothrottle engaged. While attempting to troubleshoot the indication issue; the aircraft started to execute a left turn as per the active route in the FMS. This turn resulted in a rapid increase in bank to about 25 degrees; and a rapid loss in airspeed as the autopilot attempted to maintain altitude. We received a stick shaker activation. The PF disengaged the autopilot; and applied forward pressure and right aileron inputs. The aircraft was in a stable descent by FL300. The PF had the PM set a descent speed of 280 kts.We asked for an immediate return to ZZZZ; and [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center. We attempted to contact dispatch using XXX.X but could not get a response. As we got closer to ZZZZ; the PM set the aircraft up for the ILS Runway XX. We planned to do a flaps 15 landing and utilized the performance in flight section of the QRH to calculate landing distance due to the abnormal flaps condition and the overweight condition. As we were receiving vectors to the ILS; we overshot our initial intercept of the localizer to the left side of the Runway XX centerline. Initially; the localizer was alive on the Captain's side through the overshoot. We received a vector back to the localizer. At this time; we were in IMC. Once we received a re-intercept heading; we attempted to intercept and track the approach. At this point we lost ILS course and glide slope indications on the Captain's side. The PF attempted to follow the flight director and inadvertently descended a couple hundred feet below our ATC cleared altitude of 2500 ft. We were still a couple miles outside of the final approach fix. We broke out of IMC shortly after. I'm not sure of the altitude that we broke out at but it was between 2000 and 2300 ft. AGL. The aircraft was now located about 1 NM to the right of the Runway XX centerline. There was some confusion as to where exactly the airport was due to the erroneous indications of the flight director. The flight director continued to show a turn to the right. ATC queried about our position on the localizer and we requested a visual approach to Runway XX. This was approved and we made a safe landing in ZZZZ around XC10.,B737-300 First Officer reported erratic EGT indications climbing through FL310 resulted in stick shaker and rapid bank angle increase. The flight crew recovered from the stall and returned to landing at departure airport.

First Officer's leg normal takeoff. Radar vectors to the north; assigned to climb to flight level 300. Passing 26;000 ft. heard a loud rumbling. FO stated my aircraft. Leveled the aircraft off just above 27;000 ft. Did global assessment of the instruments. ECAM read; engine; vibration; high. First step says throttle idle. As we were confirming the number one throttle; the ECAM changed to engine shut down. Numerous distractions at this point; including ATC calling and calls from the flight attendants. Got radar vectors back toward the field and a descent to 20;000 ft. Ran the procedure. Elected not to attempt a restart even though we had windmilling RPM; good oil quantity; no vibration and a very low EGT. ECAM actions complete. Ran the QRH engine shut down checklist. I proceeded to the non-routine landing considerations while the FO set up for the VOR Runway XXL at ZZZZ. Coordinated with ATC to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) standing by. Briefed the flight attendants on the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZZ; and the safety vehicles would follow us to the gate. Briefed and flew the XXL at ZZZZ. Briefed that we would be slightly overweight at landing and I would monitor my decent rate a touchdown. We landed approximately 2;500 pounds overweight. Normal landing; rolled to the end of the runway; where we were met by ARFF. Made a PA to reassure the passengers and taxi to the gate.The mechanical failure of the engine was the root cause of the situation. There was a startle factor. Also; some confusion was caused by the ECAM changing midstream. Distractions included ATC and the flight attendants. Some of the calls and chimes from the aft of the aircraft I believe were accidental. It was the First Officer's second trip after IOE. Our training allowed us to handle this issue correctly.,A319 First Officer reported an engine failure in flight. The flight crew ran the QRH and ECAM actions; then performed an in-flight shut down of the affected engine and returned to the departure airport.

And cleared left turn on course after T/O. I; the First Officer (FO) was the Pilot Flying and was still hand flying. A left turn was made and we continued our climb. As I leveled the turn I was cross referencing the instruments and visuals when I looked and saw a flock of geese 12 o'clock. I yelled out birds. The geese where unavoidable and we impacted within seconds of me calling them out. Damage to Engine #1 was apparent as the vibrations it was putting out where extremely high. And you could feel it throughout the airframe. The Captain selected the Fuel Control Unit (FCU) ALT of 4;000 feet and a decision to return to ZZZ was made as we didn't know the extend of airframe damage that had occurred. I started a decent and left turn for a downwind back to Runway XX. The Captain alerted the Flight Attendants of the situation and advised ATC. The Captain ran the overweight landing checklist. The secondary flight plan was then activated and the ILSXX was already programmed by me on the preflight so I set the airplane up for a base and intercepted the localizer coming back to ZZZ Runway XX. A visual approach was flown and a smooth landing was done for the overweight procedure. We then taxied to the gate and deplaned as normal and resumed normal ops. Upon deplaning we inspected engine #1 to find serious blade and engine damage.,A320 First Officer reported a bird strike shortly after takeoff. Geese were observed striking the aircraft and the number one engine resulting in heavy vibrations and severe damage to the engine. The crew returned to the departure airport.

The speed brake handle initially deployed in a normal manner. Just prior to the nose wheel touching down the speed brake handle unexpectedly retracted. As the pilot flying redeployed the speed brake handle the autothrottles fire walled pitching the nose up slight and the aircraft briefly lifted off before settling back down on the runway. After a brief startle period the pilot flying called for a go around and re-stowed the speed brake handle before the crew proceeded to fly the go-around profile. The unexpected flap retraction and the uncommanded go around thrust. The pilot monitoring could have backed up the flying pilot by promptly arrested the movement of the throttles if they had not been distracted by and focused on the speed brake handle.,B737-800 flight crew reported after a very smooth landing the speed brakes auto retracted and the auto throttles went to Go Around power. The Pilot Flying executed a go-around.

Aircraft control was maintained by the Captain by tracking runway center line with good rudder and rudder trim application. Based on fire trailing the aircraft; severe damage indications and rising EGT; the left engine was secured by applying the engine fire QRC and remaining checklist. Excellent CRM throughout the aircraft occurred to handle the inflight situation and land the aircraft by visual approach to ZZZ XXL; 14 minutes later. There was a communication breakdown once on the ground where we did not have direct communication with the Fire Crew on the frequency. Tower directed us to a delay of applying Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) specifically to our overheated brakes. Once communication was established; they were able to cool the brakes over the next hour in order to return to the gate under tow and egress the aircraft normally.,B767 Flight Crew reported #1 Engine failure at landing gear retraction after take-off. The Flight Crew performed an inflight shut down of the engine and returned to land at departure airport.

The planned sequence was to return the same aircraft and crew to ZZZ after a regular scheduled ground turn in ZZZZ.The flight from ZZZ to ZZZZ was uneventful; although the flight crew observed the in the log described high flashing indication accompanied with the previously mentioned vibration values in the log. No airframe vibrations were observed. The return flight with the First Officer (FO) as pilot flying (PF); departed ZZZZ Runway XXL on a radar vectored departure with subsequent direct navigation to ZZZZZ to join the flight plan route. Climbing through approximately 26;000 ft.; the aircraft experienced suddenly moderate to high airframe vibrations occurring continuously; while the engine N2 vibration indications repeatedly and intermittently varied between normal and exceeded values. Initially no ECAM messages were displayed. After standard SOP call outs (my aircraft; etc.); we re-established the initial roles of PF (FO) and pilot monitoring (PM) (Captain); while beginning to assess the situation at hand. The Captain contacted ATC and requested to maintain current altitude due to technical problem and we leveled off slightly above 27;000 ft.By now the ECAM message ENG 1 HIGH VIBRATION was displayed intermittently; upon which the Captain informed ATC about our intentions to return to ZZZZ [requesting priority handling] and requesting initial radar vectors; descent clearance and Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) assistance upon arrival. We received a southerly heading and an initial descent to 20;000 ft.During the situational assessment; multiple calls were received from ATC and cabin who were understandably seeking information; which slowed us down slightly.My focus was on flying the aircraft; initiating descent; and reducing air speed to 250 kts. to minimize airframe vibration and managing time. The highest vibration value noticed by me as PF was 9.8 Units.A few seconds later with the ENG 1 HIGH VIBRATION now being displayed continuously; we performed the ECAM actions for high vibration. As I moved the #1 thrust lever towards Idle; the ECAM changed to ENG 1 FAIL. Following standard communication protocols; the Captain performed the ECAM actions; leading to shutting down the #1 Engine and starting the APU. We agreed not to attempt a restart of the failed engine. The Captain continued with the QRH follow up items and managing communication with Dispatch; Cabin; and ATC; while I continued as PF and setup the aircraft for a VOR Runway XXL/Flap 3 approach to ZZZZ. With the QRH follow up items complete; Dispatch informed via ACARS 7700; flight attendants and passengers briefed and cleared by ATC directly to the IAF for the VORXXL; we switched PF/PM roles for landing; with the Captain now PF asking me to double-check the QRH follow up items for After Engine Shutdown.Following a quick approach briefing; an uneventful; well flown single engine approach and landing on Runway XXL (approximately 2;500 pounds over maximum landing weight/offset runway) under VFR conditions was performed. Subsequent normal taxi to the gate under ARFF supervision was also uneventful. The CVR was turned off post-flight by way of pulling circuit breakers as stated in the FOM.Aircraft had a history of engine vibration indications on several previous flights.Earlier investigation of causes of the vibration indications; once there are multiple entries in the log.,First Officer reported excessively high engine vibration in flight; followed by #1 engine failure. The flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

[Requested priority handling] with a turn back to ZZZZ airport. QRC checklist was executed with #2 motor being secured; flight attendants (FAs) notified; Company sent message and passengers notified. Single engine approach made to landing with Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) standing by; aircraft was inspected after full stop with no evidence of fire. Taxied to terminal and deplaned our passengers. Making sharp decision in a timely matter while conducting tasks in a chronological order is key. Aircraft X was executed at a high level of precision and accomplished safely Increase internal engine inspections and monitor engine data on engines.,Flight crew and Dispatcher reported catastrophic failure of the #2 engine in climb and performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

Could hear power transfer unit operating. G low pressure turned into a green low level. Yellow electric pump overheated with power transfer unit continually running. Ran ECAM and turned off power transfer unit and yellow electric pump for overheat. Overheat was resolved and we regained yellow system. We got extended vectors for the air return. While on vectors we completed the ECAMs; comms; and got landing performance numbers. Performed a flap 3 landing under gross weight on runway XXL in ZZZ. Stopped on runway and was inspected by airport rescue and firefighting vehicles. Taxi back to the gate under aircraft power followed by an airport rescue and firefighting vehicle. Attempted APU start twice. Both times resulted in APU auto shutdown. Upon arriving at the gate; passengers were deplaned.,A320 First Officer reported multiple failures of the hydraulic system shortly after takeoff necessitating a return to the departure airport.

North of the waypoint ZZZ1 we started right deviation from the arrival to avoid the weather working with ZZZ approach control which was very busy working with all the other arriving aircrafts and it was very difficult to get the word in. Proceeding Southwest of ZZZ1 waypoint; we noticed a gap between the buildups in that area and started a shallow turn to the left to get back on ZZZZZ 4E arrival. At this point we have received instructions from ZZZ arrival control to proceed direct to ZZZZZ1 waypoint. Selecting direct to ZZZZZ1 intersection created projected course line that coincided with the gap between the buildups. Proceeding between the buildups we have encountered moderate to severe turbulence and fewer bursts of hail hitting the windshields; which was followed by ECAM caution 'WINDSHIELD HEAT 1+2 INOP'. We noticed the outer pane of the windshields were cracked. At this point we were close to ZZZZZ1 waypoint and out of the turbulence and precipitation; and continue the approach to a safe landing in ZZZ on runway XX left. We've worn the cabin crew about bad weather ahead and have prepared them for landing descending through around 30;000 ft well north of ZZZ1 waypoint and followed it with prepare for landing announcement. At the gate all the passengers deplaned with none reporting any injuries; cabin crew was fine also. Before securing the aircraft we also talk to maintenance and ZZZ fire rescue chief; where we got confirmation that all the passengers were fine.,A319 pilot reported encountering moderate to severe turbulence and bursts of hail hitting the windshield followed by an ECAM caution for windshield heat 1+2 inop; with cracking of the outer panes of the windshield. The flight crew continued the approach to make a landing at the destination airport.

We followed Company non-normal procedures and ran the ECAM actions; QRH; etc. I used SATCOM to call Dispatch and Maintenance Control and while I was talking to them; I observed the Y hydraulic reservoir quantity begin to reduce. At that point; we decided to divert to ZZZ which had the longest runway and Customs.I contacted ZZZ Radio on HF and [requested priority handling] and asked for immediate vectors to ZZZ. As we headed to ZZZ the reservoir steadily reduced to zero and the associated ECAMs appeared: Y RSVR LO LVL and Y SYS LO PR. I kept the flight attendants and passengers updated throughout the event. I advised the flight attendants that we were in an immediate situation.As a result of the loss of yellow system hydraulics; we had no nose wheel steering among other inop systems. We ensured that ATC knew that we would be stopping on the runway and would need a tow.The Crash Fire Rescue (CFR)/firetrucks were on standby at the runway and approached us after we came to full stop and shut down the engines to inspect the aircraft. They noted signs of hydraulic fluid on the airplane.We were towed to the gate with no further issues and waited for customs and border patrol to clear us to deplane. I made a maintenance logbook entry for the HYD Y ENG 2 PUMP LO PR ECAM followed by a complete draining of the Y reservoir contents.,A321 pilot reported the yellow hydraulic system lost pressure and quantity during cruise. The flight crew diverted and made a precautionary landing.

Prior to push back we discussed the procedures for an APU on take-off as it is a supplementary procedure in the AOM. We were cleared for take-off on XXL ZZZ. Shortly after lift-off and prior to gear up selection I noticed a couple of blurs outside my window pass beneath the aircraft; passing right to left. Immediately thereafter we heard several thuds and immediate vibration that seemed to be coming from the vicinity of the radome and/or the nose gear. After a brief consultation with the Captain; we elected to hold off gear up selection as gear integrity was in doubt and climb performance was satisfactory. No ECAMS. Upon thrust reduction; altitude CLB thrust was selected and flaps one selected and speed intervention of 200 kts. A bird strike was reported to Tower and we were switched over to Departure. Noise from the gear down and the vibration was incredibly loud and made communication very difficult even with headsets on. We advised ATC and asked to return to the airport. ATC told us to expect XXC and asked for souls on board as well as fuel load. We still suspected issues with our gear and possible radome damage so we requested a low approach so ATC could inspect gear/aircraft for abnormalities. The Captain continued to fly and I set up the FMGC for an ILS XXC and entered relevant data into the approach page. Passengers and Flight Attendants (FAs) were briefed as to our situation and intentions. During downwind we received an ECAM for ENG 1 FIRE DET LOOP B. No ECAM action items. The only anomaly on the Engine Warning Display (EWD) for ENG 1 was High N1 Vibrations. The Captain reduced thrust on the number one engine and did not see any appreciable reduction - we assumed we had cowling damage not necessarily engine damage. We performed the low approach on XXC between 1200 ft. and 1000 ft. Tower reported no anomalies seen through binoculars from the Tower and gave us positive confirmation that we had hit some mallard ducks on take-off. We climbed out to 3000 ft. and then requested a long downwind vector to return to land in ZZZ. Complicating our situation was a squall line incoming to ZZZ that would have complicated extended holding. That coupled with increased turbulence/high winds and the continued high vibration/noise we decided to make a return earlier rather than later.	During the second downwind we got HYD G RSV LO LVL. ECAM actions were run and this required turning off the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) as well as the G ENG 1 pump. A subsequent ELEC GEN 1 Fault led us to turn off the left gen. We still had the APU running from the take-off configuration and since we had elected to keep it running all busses were powered. Some more spurious ECAMs came up causing distractions; Fire DET Faults and HYD. I don't remember the exact ones. No ECAM actions associated with them. I set up the FMGC for another ILS to XXC and performed a non-normal landing distance assessment. I came up with approx 8500 ft. and XXC has an LDA of 10500 ft. I then ran the overweight landing checklist and it was agreed that we would do the approach with CONFIG 3 rather than FULL as without the system we were going to have issues if the gear was raised on a go-around. I should have redone the landing assessment as the change in configuration would have changed the assessment to approx 9500 ft. I think at this point we both thought XXL was still closed for inspection and never thought to ask if the longer runway was available. We reviewed the status page and the list of inoperative items. The Captain asked me to have the QRH handy in case of the need for an evacuation checklist after landing. We communicated to ATC that due to the loss of hydraulics we were unsure of our ability to taxi (steer) off the runway after landing and indicated it would be a full stop landing. A descent and before landing checklist was actioned. We executed the ILS landing and I gave the Captain continuous descent rates through 500 ft. as due to weight we were descending on the glide at around 900 ft/minute. Touchdown occurred with less than 300 ft/minute indicated. We brought the airplane to a full stop abeam taxiway. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles were present and we asked them to inspect both engines; wing surfaces and brakes for signs of damage/fire. The left wheel assembly was over 500 degrees celsius and brake fans were selected on. ARFF indicated some damage to ENG 1 and possibly some wing damage but brakes and landing gear looked fine. Due to damage to engine 1 we elected to shut down both engines and request a tow off. We left spoilers and flaps in their landing configuration as we felt retracting them might cause further damage. Due to the relative urgency to get the airplane back on the ground we never ran the non-normal landing procedures from the pages nor any ECAM follow ups but all relevant details and briefings that stem from that were discussed and actioned as best as possible. There was obviously a lot of pressure/stress for us to get the airplane back down quickly and not to do extended troubleshooting or extra follow up checklists. As a result we never got the chance to formally notify the company. But FAs/passengers/ATC were all fully aware of our situation and intentions. High noise and vibration made communication very difficult. Coupled with rapidly approaching poor weather we elected to get the airplane on the ground quickly. This time pressure did not allow us to run all available follow up procedures from the pages. However; I think all big picture procedures were completed satisfactorily and taking extra time to do 'tidy-up' work would have decreased safety margins rather than enhance them. Bird strike the root cause.,A321 flight crew reported multiple bird strikes on take-off and subsequent ECAM messages indicating nacelle and cowl damage to the #1 engine. The flight crew coordinated a fly by of the Tower to check the landing gear condition and then returned for a safe landing.

We responded to the systems failure per SOP. Conducting the ECAM actions through the end of the status page review. Before I could accomplish the QRH follow-up and climbing toward 20;000 feet. MSL; a Flight Attendant (FA) called to report a loud grinding noise in the back of the aircraft. I told FA that it was probably associated with the hydraulic system failure and that I would call back. At that moment; the continuous repetitive chime sounded.The autopilot disconnected; we were presented with a red AUTO FLT AP OFF; RED HYD G+Y SYS LO PR; and a RED LAND ASAP on the upper ECAM. An Amber HYD Y RSVR OVHT; an Amber HYD Y SYS LO PR; and an Amber F/CTL ALTN LAW also appeared.I directed the First Officer (FO) to [request priority handling] and to get us a landing on the longest runway at ZZZ and discarded pursuit of the follow-up for the system failure to work the more severe problem now presented to us by the ECAM. The ECAM directed Power Transfer Unit (PTU) OFF and AFFECTED PUMPS OFF. It then directed: 'If Yellow SYS Lost by ENG 2 PUMP LO PR:YELLOW ELEC PUMP ON.' Not knowing for sure whether the system hydraulic failure was caused by a leak or by the engine 2 pump; I decided not to activate the electric pump at this time. The airplane was flying and controllable. FO was descending us toward ZZZ. My goal was to work the ECAM top to bottom and slow down the situation. I accomplished windows 1 through 4 for the ECAM and sent an ACARS message for the divert to ZZZ; including 'G + Y HYD SYS FAIL' in the text.I then made an all-call to the FAs and advised them that we would be making a precautionary landing at ZZZ in about XX minutes because two of our three hydraulic pumps had failed. I told them that the aircraft was controllable and asked if there were any additional symptoms in the back such as grinding or noise. They said that the grinding had gone away. I also asked them if they had any questions and advised that I would make a PA. My PA to the passengers advised that a failure of redundant systems would require us to divert and land at ZZZ. Apologizing for the inconvenience; I told them that we would be landing in approximately XX minutes; to follow Flight Attendant instructions; and that safety equipment would be present on both sides of the aircraft after we landed.FO was doing superbly. They were simultaneously hand-flying the aircraft; working with ZZZ Center; and setting up the FMS for the approach at ZZZ. They kept the speed under control; coordinated the approach to ZZZ Runway XXR; and; because the aircraft was in alternate law; decided not to use speed brakes in the descent--all excellent judgment calls. I turned my attention to the landing distance problem. FO was entering data into the performance approach page; and I asked them to leave the configuration in flaps full so that I could use that number for the land approach. 126 is what was the annunciated Vapp. The ECAM procedure calls for a flaps 3 approach. Using a G + Y hydraulic failure; the land app yielded a Vapp speed of 151 kts. and 9;517 feet on ZZZ Runway XXR which is 11;500 feet long.In the descent in the vicinity of 10;000 feet MSL; FO reminded me that I had not turned on the Yellow Electric HYD pump (previous judgment). I reviewed the verbiage about ENG PUMP LO PR; looked at the hydraulic page again; and turned the Yellow Electric Pump ON. This restored the Yellow Hydraulic System. The aircraft returned to normal with Blue and Yellow Systems providing power to the flight controls. Not wanting to backtrack through ECAM procedures or delay landing any further; I decided to keep the Vapp speed and landing distance that I had calculated for the dual (green + yellow) hydraulic system failure rather than recalculate for what was now a single (green) hydraulic system failure.The status page required landing gear gravity extension and annunciated that landing gear retract and nose wheel steering would be inoperative.I contacted ZZZ operations to advise them that we would need to be towed from the runway and that they would need to come up with a plan for deplaning the passengers; either by air stairs on the runway or a tow to the gate. We descended to 4;000 MSL. As I reviewed the landing gear gravity extension procedure in the QRH; FO sensed that I needed additional time and requested the ZZZ Approach to vector us across the localizer; which was helpful. We then turned in to intercept the final course. I resumed communications duties. We ran the descent checklist; ensured that the performance approach page was set for the flaps 3 approach; ensured that the GPWS flaps 3 button was depressed; and configured to flaps 3 per the QRH checklist. FO called for the gear; and I performed the landing gear gravity extension procedure. The procedure was uneventful. We completed the before landing checklist and agreed that the go-around would be a gear down; flaps 3; go-around straight out to 3;000 MSL.I reconfirmed with Tower and fire command that we would be stopping the aircraft on the runway; would be unable to taxi; and need to be towed to the gate. FO flew the approach flawlessly; landing on ZZZ XXR at XA:59 PM on center line and well within the touchdown zone; bringing the aircraft to a stop on the runway just short of taxiway intersection in about 7;500 feet of rollout. Note; lack of nose wheel steering caused slight nose wheel castering as the aircraft slowed through about 5-10 kts; but FO handled it nicely. I asked FO to set the parking brake and start the APU; called the flight attendants to let them know that we would remain where we were on the runway; and made a PA to the passengers reminding them of the safety equipment around the aircraft and to follow FA instructions. I also let them know that we would remain on the runway because the aircraft was unable to taxi.FO noted later that the parking brake is difficult to set when the landing gear crank handle is pulled up. We stowed the handle. I then asked the fire command to approach both left and right sides of the aircraft to check for heat and/or fluid leaks. They then asked us to shut the engines down so that they could approach the aircraft. Fire command chalked the nose wheel. With APU running; we complied with the engine shutdown. They discovered significant fluid leaking from the right main wheel well and asked us to depressurize the hydraulic system. I secured the yellow electric hydraulic pump. My decision not to engage the yellow electric pump as part of the G + Y ECAM procedure was a result of the 'fog of war.' In retrospect; I should have turned on the yellow electric pump sooner; but good CRM and effective trapping of threats and errors got us to the right end state before landing.My decision not to recalculate landing distance and Vapp was based on knowing that the numbers we had were conservative. We had plenty of runway. I did not want to make another orbit and delay landing any further. This was a sound decision. The call from the flight attendants and my technique of completing the entire ECAM action procedure (down to the status page) prevented me from getting to the QRH follow-up on the initial green system failure. In retrospect; I would still answer the call from the FAs because they provide a window to airplane status that could be vital information to the flight deck crew. But had I accomplished the QRH follow-up for the green system failure prior to reviewing the status page; it would have advised that because the PTU had activated to power the green hydraulic system from the operating yellow hydraulic system; it might overheat. It directs to ignore the overheating yellow system and the associated dual failure procedures and to turn off the PTU and keep the yellow engine pump on. This would have prevented the perceived dual system G+Y failure.Airbus should change the ECAM procedure and incorporate the follow ups into the ECAM page so that the crew can get to them sooner. The PTU overheated the yellow hydraulic system after approximately x minutes. As rapidly as the yellow system failure occurred; I recommend making the very simple and very short QRH follow up procedures part of the ECAM procedure to prevent the second failure. Alternatively; recommend making it standard to review the status page in window 4 after completing QRH follow-ups rather than an option. Getting to the follow up procedure sooner (after window 3) in our case might have prevented the second (yellow system) failure from occurring.,A319 Flight Crew reported a HYD G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR message annunciated during climb out; followed by multiple other associated warnings. The Flight Crew completed a diversion and landing.

ECAM actions were followed and after completion; the ECAM HYD Y ENG 2 PUMP LO PR appeared due to turning off the Eng 2 Pump as directed by the first ECAM. After completing the ECAM; Dispatch was contacted and Maintenance Control was patched in. After consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and discussion amongst fellow crew members; the decision was made to return to ZZZ. [Priority handling was requested]. While in the turn the flight attendants were called and given a briefing. Shortly after; a PA was made to the passengers briefly explaining the situation and that we would be returning to ZZZ. As the ride was smooth; the FAs (Flight Attendant) were permitted to finish the service that they had already started in order to give a sense of normalcy and calmness in the cabin. Once the 180-[turn] was completed; ATC provided a route direct to ZZZ where we advised that we would require Runway XXR for landing due to its length. After making the turn back to ZZZ; we realized that the aircraft would be overweight upon landing so a descent to FL240 was requested from and granted by ATC. This was due to attempting to burn as much fuel as possible to be as close as possible to maximum landing weight upon arrival. The Overweight Landing Checklist was completed while still in cruise back to ZZZ. Landing distance was calculated by both Dispatch and myself and the values came to within approximately 200 ft. of each other at around 8;500 ft. This gross error check satisfied us that the calculations were accurate.While in cruise back to ZZZ; discussions were had regarding status page notes and stopping technique. It was noticed during discussion of status page notes that the ECAM had the crew turn on the electric yellow hydraulic pump during the approach phase while neither of the non-normal checklists in the FM (Flight Manual) contained that procedure. As the accumulator pressure was dropping slowly and the concern of losing any remaining fluid existed; the decision was made to follow the status notes in the FM non-normals section and not turn on the yellow electric pump during approach. A normal approach briefing then took place. Once the aircraft neared ZZZ; ATC provided vectors overhead for a right downwind to [Runway] XXR. The aircraft was configured early due to flap movement being slow and the desire to have extra altitude in the event another malfunction occurred. We were then vectored for approximately a 15-mile final where a visual approach was conducted. The autopilot was selected off at approximately the FAF to get a feel of how the aircraft would handle while having the yellow hydraulic system inoperative. A normal landing was made and the aircraft exited at Taxiway XX. After exiting the runway the aircraft was stopped and emergency vehicles surveyed the aircraft. Ground personnel advised that there was no evidence of hydraulic fluid on the aircraft. Emergency vehicles then cleared and the aircraft was taxied to the ramp where the engines were shut down and a tow-in was made to the final parking spot.Prior to the tow-in; the yellow electric pump was turned on momentarily to charge the accumulator in order to set the parking brake prior to shutting down engines and completing as much of a normal procedure as possible. After turning on the yellow electric pump; the hydraulic SD page was referenced and we noticed that the fluid quantity had dropped slightly. This led me to believe that if the pump was turned on according to the ECAM status notes during the approach phase and not left off according to the FM non-normal status notes; that all remaining fluid would have been lost. After shutting down the engines and waiting for the Tow Team to connect to the aircraft; it was discovered that the Tow Team did not have a headset available to communicate to the cockpit with. Instead; the busy Ramp frequency was used to communicate with the Tow Team; which led to confusion and a slight delay in getting the aircraft to the gate. After completion of the parking checklist; appropriate maintenance write-ups were made and debriefings took place with the crew; Operations Control Flight Operations Representative; and Chief Pilot.,A319 Captain reported that the ECAM HYD Y RSVR LO LVL appeared while in cruise. As the flight crew ran and followed the QRH and checklists; there was confusion regarding a procedure with a hydraulic pump. After consulting with Dispatch and Maintenance Control; the flight crew performed an air turnback.

After takeoff from Runway XXR in ZZZ; First Officer (FO) requested gear up and I noticed the ANTI SKID INOP light illuminated. Once the after takeoff checklist was called and the gear handle was placed to the off position; the anti-skid light extinguished. At cruise; the auto brakes were selected to 1; 2; and 3 to check for proper operation due to previous write ups and the AUTO BRAKE DISARM light illuminated and did not go away. Previous write-ups from today and Day 0 confirmed that this was a chronic issue with the auto brakes but did not reference the anti-skid system being inop. The previous write up from today also referenced a transducer #2 fault.The QRH was referenced regarding both ANTI SKID INOP and AUTO BRAKE DISARM. With the possibility of another transducer fault or a possible ANTI SKID failure; as a crew we discussed our options with an ANTI SKID failure and felt continuing to ZZZ was okay with good weather; long runways and a lighter weight and speed on landing.Dispatch and Maintenance Control were contacted to discuss the possibility of an anti skid system failure. Maintenance Control agreed with the Captain that there is a distinct possibility that the anti skid system is not working given the recent history of write ups along with the ANTI SKID INOP light illuminating now. We decided the ANTI SKID INOP QRH took precedent over the AUTO BRAKE DISARM QRH and planned for the possibility of an ANTI SKID INOP with no auto brakes on landing. My additional thoughts were that if the gear handle was placed to the down position on arrival and the ANTI SKID INOP light returned; we would be prepared. Further; with the two previous write ups including a transducer fault; it was a distinct possibility that the anti skid system was INOP.With the possibility of hot brakes; blown tires and a loss of directional control after landing without anti skid; it was decided that we would [request priority handling]; continue to ZZZ and request to land on the longest Runway XX in ZZZ. The flight attendants including Purser Person A were then brought into the loop and were given information and a briefing. At this point we had 90 minutes until landing and we discussed that we would prepare the cabin for a [priority] landing and possible evacuation when we had 45 minutes prior to landing.At 45 minutes prior to landing; I made a PA to the passengers explaining the mechanical issue we were experiencing and that the flight attendants would be preparing the cabin for a [priority] landing in addition to assuring them that we fully expected this landing to be normal but we are going to prepare for a [priority] landing as a precaution.FO and I reviewed the ANTI SKID INOP QRH and performed a thorough threat briefing to include a flaps 40 landing; the non-normal landing distance chart; an early stable approach; Captain PA announcements; touching down in the touchdown zone; manual speed brake deployment; use of max reverse thrust longer than normal; braking according to the QRH and the possibility of blown tires and directional control issues if the main wheels lock up. FO did a great job managing the threats; slowed and became stable early for the approach. At 500 ft. and approximately 30 seconds prior to landing; I made the PA; brace; brace; brace. FO flew a stable descent and touched down on center line and in the touch down zone where I manually deployed the speed brakes. Maximum reverse thrust was selected; and light steady braking was used after the nose wheel touched down. I assumed command of the aircraft at about 80 kts. and kept maximum reverse thrust in until around 40-50 kts. We vacated the Runway at XX and taxied on to X where the PA; remain seated; remain seated was made. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) responders met the aircraft and confirmed all looks normal and would follow us to the gate and check the brake temps after we parked. Brake temps were confirmed all normal after parking.The entire crew did an outstanding job preparing and executing on this situation. In the end we were able to manage the threats properly; execute a safe operation by minimizing any errors and prepared for the possibility of a non-normal landing according to our training.After we parked; Maintenance reviewed the faults and again came up with a transducer #2 fault. They assured me anti skid was indeed operative and decided to MEL the auto brake system for our next flight from ZZZ-ZZZ2 without any lengthy investigative work on the ANTI SKID INOP issues. I agreed to take the aircraft with the auto brakes MELed. On the next flight; once again the ANTI SKID INOP light was extinguished on departure but illuminated again when the gear was requested up and extinguished when the gear handle was placed to off. On this flight we suspected the anti skid was working after the assurance from ZZZ Maintenance and continued with the AUTO BRAKE DISARM MEL. Landing in ZZZ2 was uneventful. However; I believe this aircraft needs a more thorough review for ANTI SKID INOP issues given the two write ups today for ANTI SKID INOP light illuminating after takeoff.Finally; the FOM was referenced for required reports but we never did call the Chief Pilot before continuing our next flight from ZZZ to ZZZ2 due to time. However; we self-assessed as a crew and both felt comfortable continuing our day and final leg of the trip.,B737 flight crew reported anti skid system failure after selecting gear up. The flight crew ran the QRH and checklists; then checked the autobrake system; which also failed. The flight crew continued to destination airport.

Storms had passed thru earlier and had left behind clouds; a little wind; and icing conditions on arrival. Wing & engine anti-ice were on. Flying through a cloud layer we both noticed a substance on the front windows. I thought at first it was the clouds and the low visibility associated with it. But the FO stated 'what's on the windows?' We were at approximately 10;000 ft. MSL at this time and stabilized on the RNAV approach path. We were cleared for the approach and the FO could not get the aircraft to slow down. He attempted to go to vertical speed zero and we set the speed at 180 kts. but twice the power advanced for what appeared to be no reason. I suggested we put the gear down - we were at approximately 230-240 kts. Putting the gear down did not help. We now were pretty high for the approach so I asked Tower for an S-turn. He gave us a climb to 9;000 ft. - the controller never stated the word 'go-around' but in essence that was what he was giving us. The FO advanced the power to TOGA and stated such and I stated 'TOGA set' then he went to climb and since we never had the flaps out we went straight to the gear and brought them up. Since the Autopilot was off at the time; the FO started the go-around manually and as I was talking with ATC and slightly heads down reloading the approach the FO stated at least once that he could not get the Autopilot back on. I heard him say a few minutes later that he got it back on. We requested and received the ILS XXL. Came around and flew the aircraft normally to a normal landing. The entire time this film was caked on the front windows. The side windows were clear. We could make out the runway but it was blurry. Landed normally and as I taxied off the runway I realized that the windows were slightly obscuring my view to taxi. This was in daylight hours - had it been at night I am not sure I could have taxied to the gate. Upon arriving at the gate and shutting the engines down; I opened my window and reached my hand out to touch whatever it was on the window. I had tried airborne once to use the wipers but they did not help. The best way I can describe the substance is a white powdery substance that would not come off on my hands but was caked onto the window. I felt the nose of the aircraft and I could feel it on there as well. The aircraft was staying the night in ZZZ so the FO was required to walk-around. I waited until he walked around and he came back and said he did not see anything unusual. I called Maintenance and explained to them what we had - I told him I wasn't even sure how to write this up. He agreed with me that this was a highly unusual thing. The next morning I noticed the aircraft had been very delayed leaving ZZZ and we were scheduled to leave at the gate next to the aircraft. I also noticed in the on-line maintenance log that they had stated that 'due to a sand storm they found the AOA was not moving freely'. Upon arriving at the airport the agent told me that they flew in 6 mechanics on a private jet for that aircraft. When I was doing the walk-around I noticed them and went over and talked with them in detail to give them more of the story. They said the windows had been cleaned by the time they got there but there was still some residue and some on the aircraft itself. They also did not know what it was but were performing a complete flush of the system. The aircraft is back in service now.I am not sure what that substance was nor if it affected the aircraft in a way that made it impossible for us to slow it down. Never seen anything like it. Maybe the act of the go-around put everything 'back in order'??? Just thought some sort of report other than writing it up in the logbook and talking in detail with maintenance should be sent. I would love to find out what the substance was and where it came from!I have nothing to add here from what I already wrote above.,A321 Captain reported engine thrust malfunctions caused an unstable approach. The flight crew elected to go-around and troubleshoot the issues. Both windscreens were observed to be clouded with an unknown material. Post flight revealed very fine sand was on the wind screens and the 'AOA was not moving freely.'

After multiple attempts to reset the system in guidance with Maintenance we're unsuccessful we returned to ZZZ after consulting with Dispatch. Before the Systems Failed; we had a CAT 3 Dual ECAM Message. While we were looking into the reason for this both FMGCs failed which resulted in the Autopilot Disconnecting. We were able to use the backup NAV and use VOR navigation but due to lack of Autopilot we couldn't remain in RVSM Airspace. When I queried the Dispatcher about fuel burn to ZZZ1 he stated that we would land with 7.3. We found this odd because our original release had us landing with 7.0 and a cruise of FL350. I didn't feel we could realistically make ZZZ1 at FL270 and we decided that a return to ZZZ was best.,B737-800 pilot reported a Dual FMGC Failure during cruise. The flight crew ran the QRH and checklists; then contacted Dispatch. Due to doubts as to the fuel on board being sufficient to reach the destination airport; the flight crew performed an air turn back to departure airport.

Broke off approach. Conducted ECAM and QRH; setting up for flaps 3; slats between 0 and 1; Vref plus 25 landing. Briefed; [priority handling requested]. Normal landing ZZZ XXL. On Day 0; ZZZZ-ZZZ; Aircraft X (A321 Neo). Captain (CA) is Pilot flying (PF); First Officer (FO) is PM. Normal departure; cruise and descent from ZZZZ to ZZZ. On approach to ILS XXR; PF called for flaps 1. At which point an ECAM F/CTRL SLATS FAULT was received. Slats indicated amber at position zero. Per ECAM; PM recycled flaps back to zero; then back to flaps 1. ECAM reappeared. PM notified Approach Control we needed to break off approach and work system fault. ZZZ Approach complied with giving delaying vectors at 3000 ft. assigned altitude. PF (CA) then transferred controls to the PM (FO) to begin the non-normal procedure. (PF now FO - PM now CA) CA also assigned radio duties to FO during the non-normal. PM (CA) completed the ECAM; then completed QRH using standard procedures. Noticed fuel was approximately 7.9; which led to a sense of urgency. QRH landing distance was determined to be 8;340 ft. According to previously determined landing numbers; ZZZ XXR available runway landing distance was 8486 ft. CA determined that was too close and determined Runway XXL (11;248 ft.) was more suitable. ILS XXL was loaded in the FMS with appropriate QRH directed speed changes. Although QRH directed landing distance was referenced and determined to be controlling; landing distances from ACARS were still obtained. Attempted to notify ZZZ base operations via VHF radio with no contact. (Possibility due to slant range distance to ZZZ?) Sent abbreviated ACARS message to Operations Control. Selected EMER CALL P/B for in-flight notification. Notified in-flight crew as to the situation; and briefed in-flight crew as to highlights. (Flight control slats stuck - what that meant to aircraft control on approach/landing. Estimated landing in 5 to 10 minutes. Expected normal landing. Fire trucks would be on the side of the runway). Then confirmed with each in-flight individually if they had any questions. Once in-flight complete; returned focus to landing. Side note - CA did not make the PA announcement nor did CA not request in-flight to make an announcement to the passengers. CA did not make the PA announcement as they overheard the #1 in-flight made a PA announcement and heard the word 'emergency' used. They did not hear the entire announcement.Aircraft control was passed back to the CA; (CA now PF - FO now PM). [Priority handling requested] with ATC; requested Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) to be standing-by at the side of the runway. Requested ILS XXL and ready to commence approach. Received ATC vectors to join ILS XXL outside of ZZZZZ at 2;000 feet; cleared ILS XXL approach. The PM pointed out the aircraft was in alternate law. Discussions as to when the aircraft was going to direct law. Determined to delay landing gear and deselection of auto-pilot until later than normal on the approach. CA reviewed out-loud with FO all tasks and what was the status of each task to ensure all obvious tasks were completed to the best of our ability. FO agreed all was complete. Once on approach; landing gear was lowered at approximately 1500 ft. AGL; landing checklist completed; 1;000 stable call completed. Auto-pilot was deselected at approximately 700 feet. Aircraft reverted to direct law. Normal landing and roll-out. Cleared the runway; stopped; and requested CFR to confirm tire/brake temperatures. CFR determined temperatures within limits. CA then made an announcement to passengers regarding the event; all is well and taxied to gate. After the landing checklist was completed with the exception of flaps were left at flaps 3. CFR followed/paced the aircraft all the way to the gate. CFR reevaluated brake temperatures once at the gate. Brake temperatures were within limits; CFR was cleared off with a thank you. Maintenance met aircraft atthe gate. Debrief with the entire crew was conducted once all passengers were off aircraft in jet way to due vomit smell in front of aircraft. During debrief with the crew; learned multiple passengers vomited during vectors at 3;000 feet due to turbulence.,A321 pilot reported an ECAM F/CTL SLATS FAULT message on final. The flight crew performed a go-around and ran the QRH and checklists. The flight crew made another approach and landing at destination airport.

I immediately rotated the aircraft at Vr; dismissing the delayed rotation for the wind shear profile; since the aircraft was accelerating rapidly and consistently. The vibration stopped once airborne. At the time it seemed apparent that the nose gear or nose wheels were causing the vibration; however upon further assessment I was not sure which gear or wheel had caused the vibration. We cleaned up and climbed normally. ATC was giving us vectors to avoid the numerous thunderstorms in the area. My First Officer (FO) and I had a short discussion on what might have caused the vibration as we navigated around the storms. Once clear of the weather we immediately received a message from Dispatch that the Tower reported that we had blown a tire on take-off. After reviewing AOM; non normal landing on a flat tire; we discussed options and decided to continue to ZZZ1. This was the best option to burn off fuel with long dry runways at sea level. It was also an online Maintenance station and delivered our passengers to their destination. Returning to ZZZ was not an option due to the weather and wet runways. I contacted our Dispatcher via Company radio with the plan; asked them to [request priority handling]; have the ZZZ1 station prepared for a possible tow to the gate; and to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) waiting upon our arrival. Our Dispatcher was in agreement with the plan. I briefed the Flight Attendants and passengers of the status of the aircraft and that we would experience a landing with possible vibrations during the roll out. I assured all that I was not concerned about the landing; but we would have ARFF vehicles standing by as an extra measure of safety and they could inspect the aircraft before we taxied to the gate. On approach I extended the gear early to assure proper function. The landing gear extended normally. However; we did not have a green left main gear safe light on the front panel but had all three green on the overhead panel. Having the left main green light out on the front panel confirmed that the vibration and tire/s failure was most likely on the left main gear.I asked the Tower to observe our landing gear on our approach. They confirmed that all landing gear appeared to be down. I landed normally with a flaps 40 setting for slower speed. Touchdown was soft and the aircraft settled with left wing low. I had to use the right rudder to keep the center line during deceleration. I used reverse thrust to slow the aircraft primarily then used light braking while using most of the runway to stop and not to stress the remaining tire unnecessarily. ARFF assessed the aircraft; and it was determined that it was safe to taxi to the gate. I had them follow us to the gate. The aircraft had lost the recap on the inboard left main gear tire; and I believe it was deflated as well. It damaged the flaps and sections on the wing. A part of the tire was in the wheel well which interfered with the landing gear indication system micro switches. I made a logbook entry and turned the aircraft over to Maintenance.,B737-700 flight crew reported aircraft vibration after take-off. Dispatch informed the flight crew that Tower had observed a blown tire on take-off and the flight crew elected to continue to landing at destination airport.

AGL we had a large bird strike. We lost the Captain's airspeed Indications as the bird had impacted the Captain's pitot tube and probably affected the air temperature probe; as we later on discovered loss of both engine Electronic Engine Controls (EEC's) as well. New hire First Officer (FO) was Pilot Flying (PF) with myself as Pilot Monitoring check pilot. This was the FO first PF leg. FO remained PF for the entire event. We continued the climb and flew into an overcast layer at 700 ft. AGL; climbing to approximately 2000 ft. MSL. We had the stick shaker; low speed aural alerts; loss of both flight directors. We quickly discovered the unreliable airspeed indicator. Completed some of the memory items associated with this issue. Told ATC we needed to return. We remained in IMC conditions for the remainder of the flight. Ran the checklist for unreliable airspeed. Overweight landing. Non routine landing; and subsequently ENG EEC alternate mode. We had an uneventful landing and taxi to the gate under our own power. Elected to use ATC vectors instead of holding. No injuries; no damage to aircraft other than pitot tube and possibly air temperature probe which affected the EEC's per maintenance call. Log book entries included. Bird strike with unreliable airspeed. Overweight landing. ENG EEC to alternate mode; and pulling voice recorder per company procedure. Received a phone call from ZZZ Approach Control where they filled out a bird strike paperwork via phone call with myself. Just want to say that our training works. This was the new hire FO first flying leg. Did an excellent job of maintaining aircraft control under these particular failures. The Flight Attendants also did a great job of taking care of passengers and preparing the cabin for an unplanned return to the airport.,B737-800 Captain reported a bird strike after take-off. Captain's airspeed became unreliable and both EECs were lost requiring a return to the departure airport.

I checked the speed tape; said speed verified; and moved the flap lever to position 1. Within a few seconds; we received the ECAM: F/CTL SLATS FAULT. The CA assumed control of the aircraft while I determined it wasn't a quick action item or ECAM exception. The CA the said his aircraft; his radios; and called for the ECAM actions. The Tower gave us missed approach radar vectors over the lake while we worked through the QRH procedures. While going through these procedures; we determined the slats were stuck in the up position; but the flaps seemed to be working normally. Due to our configuration issue and our fuel level starting to get low; the CA [asked for priority handling] back to ZZZ. I did another landing assessment with the slat failure; and we agreed that we had more than adequate runway for landing. The CA temporarily gave me the aircraft and radios while he reviewed the non-routine landing considerations; spoke to the flight attendants; and advised the passengers of the situation. As anticipated; as we configured the plane for landing following the QRH procedures; the plane entered alternate law and then direct law. We landed on Runway XXL with the slats up; flaps at 3; and the landing gear down and locked. The landing was uneventful; and we taxied to the gate as normal; except that we elected to leave the flap lever where it was in case that might help Maintenance in their duties.,A321 flight crew reported receiving an ECAM F/CTL SLATS FAULT on approach. The flight crew requested a go-around and ran the QRH and checklists and landed safely.

We reviewed the situation and QRH actions for loss of C HYD pressure in case the remaining fluid leaked when the C HYD system was pressurized. On approach we [requested priority handling]; ran remaining items on the C HYD quantity checklist and configured early for the ILS XXL. At 1500 ft. AGL on a coupled ILS approach we got a TCAS TA followed by a climb RA. Despite being a priority and having no visual on any aircraft; we respected the RA. We were visual with the terrain but inflight visibility was hazy. The RA was abnormal because during the RA the target stayed at 00 and at the tip of the airplane display during the 1000 ft. climb in response to RA. Tower announced there was no traffic in the area; but we elected to follow the RA. After resolution; we were too high to resume the ILS; and asked for a 360; but accepted vectors back to ZZZZZ to re complete the full approach. We had briefed no configuration changes during missed approach due to our hydraulic situation. We reset the Mode Control Panel (MCP) and FMC after RA completion and continued for subsequent approach. We got clearance for direct ZZZZZ and then clearance for the approach. Slight deviations to altitude occurred as we tried to re engage VNAV path. We realized the issue was re cruising VNAV and then VNAV path properly engaged just prior to ZZZZZ. Again; during the descent through 4500 MSL onto the dogleg out of ZZZZZ we again got a TCAS TA followed by a climb RA. This time we noted the altitude of the target always reading 00 and staying with us. Tower assured us that we did not have traffic in the area. We applied the direction on page x that complying a second time with a likely anomalous RA would subject the aircraft to further hazard. On ILS final the nuisance RA was not an issue; and we landed uneventfully. We cleared the runway when the hydraulic system showed normal indications. Once clear; we had fire crews examine the aircraft for leaking fluid. We asked for and received tug assistance to a hard stand and deplaned. Local Maintenance personnel met the aircraft; and confirmed that the C HYD RES was empty.,B767 flight crew reported loss of C hydraulic system during cruise. The flight crew continued to destination airport and made a precautionary landing.

I thought we had had an engine failure and aborted the takeoff. We decelerated the aircraft as smoothly as possible and exited the runway. During the rollout we were able to discern that the engine had not failed; but were unclear on what may have happened. The first officer then mentioned that he thought he saw a piece of paper blowing across the runway indicating that perhaps there was a dust devil in the area of the runway.  We brought the aircraft to a stop on the taxiway.  Approximately five minutes after this; a company ops car came by to assess the situation and communicated to the tower who communicated to us that the two left main tires had blown. We then set about coordinating with company to have passengers transported back to terminal as the aircraft could not be taxied. At this point in time; my only guess is that a significant wind event took place at that part of the runway; causing the aircraft to move as it did. It was as close to a simulator engine failure as I could ever imagine. The ATIS at that time was just showing a normal day for ZZZ. I don't know how I could stop the wind from blowing the way it did; but I recommend continued training in rejected take offs in the simulator.,Air carrier captain reported a rejected takeoff after the aircraft began to yaw and was unable to correct it. After inspection it was discovered two main tires had blown and a suspected dust devil may have been in the immediate area.

After some significant taxi delays; Aircraft X; with 115 SOB; finally lifted off from Runway XXL at XA42Z and was turned South toward ZZZZZ intersection. South of ZZZ was a rapidly developing line of weather running on an East-West line. Using our weather radar; we were able to discern several embedded cells with multiple small areas of green (light) precipitation between; and those were the areas the preceding aircraft were utilizing to navigate through the line. The First Officer (FO); as flying pilot; initiated a discussion about a left turn to avoid penetrating the weather; but due to proximity; the thin nature of the line; and gaps between severe cells it was decided to continue. Just before entering the clouds we observed lightning on both sides of the aircraft and ATC issued a report to us of severe turbulence reported on our track at FL230 and; since we were much lower; we reduced our rate of climb in an attempt to avoid the turbulence. We were flying an assigned airspeed of 250 kts. Aircraft X; approx 5 miles in trail of a preceding aircraft; then penetrated the weather and encountered moderate to severe turbulence at approx FL180. Unreported heavy hail was encountered almost immediately and lasted 10-15 seconds; during which time the First Officer's windscreen was impacted with sufficient force to shatter the outer pane of the window. An immediate ECAM was also generated for failure of the right windshield anti-ice heating element. After another 15-30 seconds the aircraft was clear of all rain and clouds. Out of concern for the integrity of the remaining inner pane of the windscreen; Aircraft X [requested priority handling] with ATC; stopped our climb; asked for vectors around the weather back to ZZZ; and descended back down to 17000 ft. (to limit the force of aircraft pressurization on the broken window). Aircraft speed was limited to 250 kts. maximum by the crew to further minimize aerodynamic pressure on the remaining window pane. ATC vectored Aircraft X to the East approximately 100 NM in order to circumnavigate the weather. The Flight Attendants were briefed on the situation and information was discussed; and the Captain announced the general nature of the aircraft condition along with the plan to return to ZZZ in a PA to the passengers. After establishing on eastbound vectors; the Captain notified Dispatch of the aircraft state and intentions. A brief discussion regarding a divert to ZZZ1 was held over ACARS; but the crew felt best with a return to ZZZ remaining clear of all weather and Dispatch did not disagree. The aircraft was able to turn to the North just East of the ZZZ2 navaid. Shortly thereafter the aircraft was able to turn West toward ZZZ and remain clear of weather while returning for landing. We flew direct ZZZZZ1 then direct ZZZ and eventually were given vectors to a medium final to the ILS XXC. Due to a distorted forward view from the right control seat due to the various fracture lines in the window; the crew opted to transfer control to the left seat for landing at ZZZ. The landing; rollout; and taxi in were uneventful. The aircraft parked at y at XB14L. Maintenance action items were submitted for the broken windscreen and the related malfunction of the right windshield anti-ice heating element. After block-in at the gate; personnel from several stakeholder organizations within the company came to the aircraft; took photos; and asked a few simple questions. The Captain and FO spoke with a pilot retiree on the flight deck. The Captain contacted the duty Chief Pilot; providing all requested information and discussed the well-being of the crew. The Captain was then contacted by another Captain and conducted a short interview. The flight deck and inflight crews both felt comfortable swapping into another aircraft and continuing on to ZZZ3. Aircraft Y (second attempt) released brakes at XC38L and arrived at the gate in ZZZ3 at 0XD43L with XXX SOB; fora total block time of 2:05.,A319 Captain reported heavy weather during climb. After encountering heavy hail; the First Officer's wind screen shattered. The flight crew performed an air turn back to the departure airport.

In the approach; at about 2;000 ft. I requested the gear down; but nothing happened. We recycled the gear with no result. Go-around was initiated and ATC was informed about the problem. Passengers and inflight were advised as well. Then ECAM was completed and QRH referenced. At that point; I contacted ZZZ maintenance and then Dispatch and Maintenance via SATCOM. The conclusion was to proceed with the gravity gear extension.The following approach and landing was uneventful. The cabin crew was given a briefing. Priority handling was not requested; however we requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to stand by.,A321 pilot reported landing gear failed to extend on approach. The flight crew performed a go-around; extended the landing gear via alternate means; and landed.

MSL aircraft was IMC. In flight visibility at 1/2 mile. F/O (First Officer) [was] Pilot Flying. Traffic Advisory on PFD. I made a comment to not to descend yet due to the traffic. In seconds; the traffic converged and climbed causing a Resolution Advisory for the aircraft now at our 930. I observed the red climb bar on the PFD. I advised the First Officer to immediately initiate a climb to avoid the conflict. Simultaneously; I looked outside and got visual contact with the Aircraft Y co-altitude; belly up and with a vector into us. It was in a hard left bank to evade. I advised Tower that we were climbing for a Resolution Advisory. He advised ZZZ [Tracon] was talking to that aircraft. Tower asked if we could still land. I advised it was not possible; and that we would take vectors for another approach. Once the aircraft was clean; stable and safe; I made a public address to the Passengers advising what happened; that automated systems advised of the conflict; that we were safe; and will be landing shortly. Passengers seemed happy after we got to the gate. The Passenger in seat 1A reported seeing another aircraft at the time that our engine noise increased. In the process of transitioning from evasive maneuver into a go-around; we got an air speed; low warning. I advised the F/O to reduce climb angle and increase power; but to monitor his speed. It was a momentary deviation. I assess this conflict as a near miss that likely would've resulted in a mid-air collision if not for immediate adherence to the Resolution Advisory. I am not sure what could've been done differently. We complied with the Resolution Advisory immediately. The Cessna was in IMC conditions that they were likely not qualified for. I believe our procedures and training allowed us to mitigate the situation and safely maneuver the aircraft while avoiding a mid-air collision.,B737 flight crew reported an airborne conflict with a small aircraft while on initial approach in IMC. Captain took evasive action to avoid a collision and conducted a go around to a landing.

Due to suspected fuel leak we [requested priority handling] and in accordance with the QRH procedure informed ZZZ Center that we would be returning to ZZZ. I had set up the aircraft for a return to ZZZ and informed Dispatch of our return and situation while the Captain was working through the QRH and non normal landing checks. We returned to ZZZ with no further incident and after being checked and cleared by Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) we taxied to the gate without issues.

Scheduled takeoff time was XA:20 local ZZZZ-time and scheduled landing time was XF:09 ZZZ-time. This was my 10th flight in the left seat during my Captain's IOE after flying as an A320 FO (First Officer) for approximately 5 years. Check Pilot was in the FO seat. Our clearance was on the ZZZZZ to ZZZZZ1 up to FL380. Preflight and taxi were normal. Takeoff was made by me from the Captain's seat off Runway XX. It was a flaps 3 flex mode takeoff with a slight headwind. Takeoff was normal through thrust reduction altitude. Just after thrust reduction at just over 1;000 ft. AGL; I maneuvered the aircraft to avoid a flock of approximately six what appeared to be large black birds that passed under the right wing. Just a few seconds later; a flock of approximately four of the same large black birds passed over the left wing; and at least one of those birds was ingested by the number one engine. There was a loud bang at the sound of the impact; the left engine immediately began vibrating loudly; and the Master Warning continuous repetitive chime went off. I said 'my aircraft;' continued flying aircraft; and engaged autopilot 1. The Check Pilot analyzed the situation and determined it was not a quick action item or ECAM exception. After a brief discussion; we decided that I would continue flying the aircraft and the Check Pilot would run the ECAM actions. At engine out acceleration altitude I selected the speed to 180 kt. and requested flaps 1 and continued climbing. We stayed at this speed and configuration until beginning the approach. We continued flying the ZZZZZ through the turn to the north for a short time while the Check Pilot worked through ECAM actions. We eventually reached 8000 ft. and leveled off.The Check Pilot and I each spoke to the FAs (Flight Attendant) over the cabin interphone during the first couple minutes after the bird strike. The FAs told us what they knew about the incident from their perspective. By the second time we spoke; the Check Pilot had put out the engine fire and I notified the FAs of this. The Check Pilot; who is fluent in the country's language and could communicate well with ATC; handled radio communications. All of his communications were in English. The Check Pilot [requested priority handling] as we were flying north on the ZZZZZ. Departure Control cleared us for a right turn direct to the airport; but the Check Pilot requested a more southerly heading to line us up for an approach; and also requested a descent to 6;000 ft. The Check Pilot requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) equipment to be positioned at the runway.The Check Pilot completed ECAM actions and QRH follow-up actions. I activated and confirmed approach mode; changed our destination to ZZZZ; and updated the PERF (Performance) Page with our landing weather. The Check Pilot loaded the RNP Y XY approach - ILS glideslope was out of service. The Check Pilot sent a message to Dispatch; and very calmly spoke with the FAs and passengers. He informed the FAs that we would be doing a precautionary landing back at ZZZZ. The Check Pilot gave the passengers a description of the situation and told them we were returning to ZZZZ. We ran the After Takeoff Checklist; Descent Checklist; and verified and briefed the approach. I flew towards ZZZZZ2 and flew through the inbound course to set up for a right turn to teardrop onto the inbound approach course. At some point before ZZZZZ2 inbound we leveled off at 6;000 ft. I configured with gear and flaps 3 prior to ZZZZZ3 and we ran the Before Landing Checklist. Autobrakes were medium. I landed on Runway XY and used full reverse thrust from engine number two and began braking immediately. We stopped just prior to Taxiway XX. The fire personnel looked over the aircraft and cleared us to taxi to parking. Ground Control cleared us to Gate XX where we parked the aircraft.Cause: Bird strike to the number 1 engine. Suggestions: Continue to emphasize the dangers of bird strikes.,A319 flight crew reported an inflight shutdown of engine #1 due to the indication of fire in the engine caused by a bird strike. The flight crew then performed an air turnback.

Everything was fine until we reached V1. As soon as my hand was a few inches off of the throttles; the fire warning horn and lights were going off everywhere. We were just past V1 so we were in go mode. As soon as I got the gear up and saw the aircraft was under control I looked down to see what all was lit up. We had both master caution lights; both fire warning lights; the fire bell; both engine 1 and 2 overheat lights; engine 1 and 2 fire handles lit up; the APU fire handle lit up and the wheel well fire light lit up. I immediately [requested priority handling] and told them we wanted to climb to 2500 ft. while entering a left downwind and base and land back on XXL. The FO was very sharp and I asked them if they felt comfortable doing that on their own while I worked the problem. They were fine and I kept an eye on the plane and our position while getting into the checklist. I went straight to the wheel well fire checklist because I felt that was our biggest threat. Both engines were running normal and no abnormal indications and the APU was off so I thought the wheel well could be on fire or have bad indications. I gave souls on board; fuel in minutes; stated our intentions and asked them to relay our situation to our company. I did the QRH; we quickly set up for the approach and turned base for XXL.I tested the lead Flight Attendant (FA) and gave a very brief PA to the passengers; ran the descent and landing checklists and landed and stopped on taxiway x. We shut both engines down and Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) said all indications were normal and no abnormal heat anywhere. We got a gate from ops; started the engines and taxied to gate. Before we taxied onto the J-line I had them check the temps again and then we taxied in and de-boarded the people. After we re-started both engines I went to put the generators online and generator 2 started the fire bell and warning lights again. Generator 1 did not trip it. I put it on the APU and it did the same thing. I went back to the engine driven generators and same thing and again went back to the APU. When we went to ground power at the gate it did the same thing with the horn and lights. From there I wrote everything up and talked to Dispatch; Maintenance at ZZZ; Ops and the Chief Pilot. From there I made sure the passengers in the terminal were taken care of and then took care of the crew. We all went to the hotel for a much needed rest. I have no idea what set all of this in motion but I thought the crew; ATC; Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF); Ops; Dispatch; Maintenance and the Chief Pilot all did their jobs very well.,B737 flight crew reported the fire detection system malfunctioned after takeoff. The flight crew performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.

The aircraft also exhibited a slight veer to the left at the same time.  I felt this was an aircraft controllability issue (potential nose wheel gear or tire failure or separation) and therefore I made the decision to reject the takeoff. The RTO maneuver was initiated at 110 knots (VI-115 KTS) in accordance with company SOPs. The RTO QRC and RTO non-normal and brake cooling for 737-700 were completed. Due to the light weight of the aircraft; brake temperatures did not reach the caution or warning zones. As part of my RTO Briefings; I brief the First Officers to also request ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) if the RTO is performed in the High speed regime. The First Officer and I quickly discussed staying on the runway or exiting.  The taxiways were wide enough that we felt ARFF would have adequate maneuvering capabilities around the aircraft and therefore elected to clear the runway so that the runway was still usable after the runway FOD check was completed.ARFF response was within 3 minutes.  Communication was established with ARFF and ATC quickly and an assessment for fire or damage was completed.  I requested that the aircraft be chocked so the parking brake would not have to be set. ARFF performed temp checks of the main gears.  Left main temperature was 502 and right main temperature was 400. ARFF set up a fan to cool the gear while we coordinated with company and airport operations. We decided to have the aircraft towed to the gate and the tow-in checklist was referenced.After all procedures were completed I briefed the passengers and the First Officer and I had a debrief with the inflight crew to discuss the event.  All crew members felt communication was clear and concise and everyone remained calm.Once able; I called and debriefed the Chief Pilot on duty; and the HF checklist was conducted on me and my First Officer. I then called dispatch to conference with Maintenance Control to give a verbal debrief of the event. I also met with the ARFF crew to discuss and complement them on their response actions.The next day the nose wheel tires were changed and I was told by Maintenance Control there was evidence of tire imbalance.  We ferried the aircraft the next day to ZZZ1 and on taxi in the nose gear began to randomly vibrate at normal taxi speeds. Entry was made for nose gear vibration and I verbally briefed the outgoing flight crew and the mechanics. Maintenance elected to take the aircraft out of service for additional inspections and an additional tire replacement. I met with the maintenance manager later to ask for an update. I was told that when they removed the replacement tires and there was evidence of flat spots and they were going to begin inspections of the entire nose wheel gear and components.,B737 flight crew reported a rejected take off at 110 knots for violent lateral nose wheel vibrations. The flight crew returned to the gate and turned the aircraft over to maintenance.

Executed a go-around. Executed QRH procedure. Attempted to lower flaps using the alternate flaps switch. First Officer (FO) reported an asymmetry developing. Flaps were at approximately 11 degrees. [Requested priority handling]. Requested the long Runway XXR. Landed uneventfully. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) checked tires and brakes and we taxied back to our gate. This Aircraft X; has had 3 flap related malfunctions in the month alone. Company Maintenance has failed to repair this aircraft properly. QRH could also have a quicker reference for flap issues. Intuitively one would search for flaps. The procedure is labeled trailing edge flap disagree. Adding to the time to find the procedure. The aircraft has had repeated flap issues that maintenance needs to resolved before the aircraft re enters service.,B737 flight crew reported trailing edge flaps failed to extend on final approach. The flight crew performed a go-around to troubleshoot and use alternate method for flap extension. The flaps then suffered a flap asymmetry condition; resulting in the flight crew receiving vector and making a precautionary landing at destination airport.

We then decided to go around to troubleshoot the problem. We notified ATC that we would need delay vectors to run the necessary checklists. We ran the QRH checklist for Trailing Edge Flap Disagree; the checklist had us setup to use the alternate flap extension procedure.  After getting flaps 15 landing data and brake cooling data for Runway XXR we had ATC vector us back around for another approach. The leading flaps and slats extended to the full ext position using the alternate flap switch. When we went to extend the trailing edge flaps; only the left began to extended and I immediately stopped extending the flaps as we now had flap asymmetry. We notified ATC we could not fly the approach and would need a longer runway at ZZZ1 along with delay vectors. We began to run the QRH checklist for Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry as directed by the QRH 'Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree' checklist. As ATC began to vector us for ZZZ1 dispatch sent us an ACARS message that they ran the numbers for a Flaps up landing and that XXR at ZZZ would be suitable for a 0 flaps landing. We ran the numbers as well and agreed with dispatch. We then completed the QRH checklist and received Brake cooling data as well. We notified ATC that we could in fact accept XXR at ZZZ and received vectors for the visual approach. We Performed a 0 flaps landing on Runway XXR at ZZZ. As directed by the brake cooling data; we proceeded to Pad XX and waited the 70 minutes for the brakes to cool with fire trucks monitoring.  After the 70 minutes we proceeded to Gate XX and deplaned. A maintenance discrepancy was written in the maintenance log.,B737 First Officer reported trailing edge flaps failed to extend on approach. The flight crew performed a go around to trouble shoot; then use the alternate flap extension procedures. This resulted in a flap asymmetry condition. The flight crew received vector back to make a precautionary landing at destination airport.

On Captain's cockpit preparation it was noted that both engines had 21.5 quarts of oil. After the engines started I noted that the oil had dropped in quantity as usual. Take-off was normal as well as the climb till around FL 250 Captain noticed the flashing advisory about the right engine oil quantity. It was down to about 1.5 quarts. Having not seen the quantity so low we asked for level off at FL 300 to see if with reduced power the quantity would go up. It did not and it in fact continued to decrease to .5; also the pressure was now coming down and showing amber. Captain gave control to the First Officer (FO). We adjusted cruise speed to see how that would affect pressure and quantity. Quantity went to zero. Pressure went back and forth between amber and red a couple of times. At this time Captain started looking at the QRH on advisory oil quantity we would expect to see an increase after power reduction and to monitor engine oil parameters. EGT; N1 and N2 remained normal the entire time. Captain used SATCOM to call Dispatch and to request Maintenance on the call also. Maintenance was seeing exactly what we saw. The master warning came on a couple times for a short time then off. Captain made the decision to secure the engine after the ECAM warning came on and stayed on. With Dispatch we came up with a diversion to ZZZ1. We ran the ECAM then QRH. During this time FO flew and communicated with ATC our plan to divert to ZZZ1 and requested priority handling. Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) was requested. Captain called the Flight Attendant (FA) at the beginning of the running of the ECAM and QRH and told them to stop any service till I had gotten back to them after informing them of a possible diversion. After ECAM and QRH was complete Captain called FAs and gave the briefing info stating the situation at that time. A passenger PA was made about what had happened and our plan to go to ZZZ1. On descent into ZZZ1 and running an overweight landing checklist. FO entered in a hold while we briefed the approach before Captain took over as Pilot Flying (PF). Before beginning the approach the FO ran the divert guide. We began the approach; autopilot was turned off and an overweight landing was successful. Landing was smooth. We taxied off the runway and CFR checked both the engine for heat or any other anomalies as well as the brakes. All were good. We taxied to the ramp and waited about 47 minutes for company personnel and ground personnel to get into position. At the gate after the shutdown Captain stood in the galley and made a PA about what had happened and about the company sending another airplane to complete their trip to ZZZ2. Captain also informed anyone who had questions while deplaning that they would answer them. FO did a walk around and saw lots of oil on the ground and on the bottom engine cowl. Logbook was noted with a write up.,A321 flight crew reported loss of right engine oil quantity and pressure in climb. The flight crew performed an in flight shut down of the right engine and elected to divert for landing.

We were cleared for takeoff; and everything was normal from brake release to about 80 kts. Just when I was about to make the 80 kts. call; there was a loud bang; the aircraft shuddered and yawed significantly to the right. The Captain immediately rejected the take-off and used the rudder to the right to keep it on the runway. We slowed to a manageable speed (unknown; I wasn't looking anymore); and I saw engine fail displayed on the number 2 engine display with the EGT dropping. I called Tower to tell them we aborted the takeoff and requested to roll Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles and we had a right engine failure. We exited the runway on taxiway x and held on y to assess and run checklists. The Captain told the passengers to remain seated. We also told Tower that they should check the runway for debris due to the engine failure. We ran the engine failure checklist and coordinated with Tower; fire trucks; Dispatch; Ops; passengers and Flight Attendants to make sure everything and everybody was okay. After about 15-20 minutes of coordination and checklists; we taxied back to the terminal; parked and allowed the passengers to deplane.,B737 First Officer reported engine failure on takeoff. The flight crew rejected the take-off and returned to the gate for maintenance action.

An ENG 1 stall ECAM warning subsequently appeared but quickly disappeared. The next ECAM to appear was the ENG 1 FAIL warning. During this period I observed a vapor briefly enter the cockpit via the vents above the windows - it quickly dissipated and was not observed again. Captain called for ECAM actions after establishing positive control; and I ran through the ECAM procedure. There were no applicable OEBs (Operational Engineering Bulletins). We determined that damage had occurred; and that fuel was not leaking. We reviewed the affected systems pages; and after ECAM actions were complete we verified that all checklists were completed and that there were no resets or relights possible prior to reviewing the status page. We also determined that we would be overweight for landing. We considered reviewing the comm procedures but determined that that activity was not a priority. I resumed comms at this point briefly before taking control while the Captain set up for; and briefed; the approach. They then took back control and comms so that I could run the landing distance assessment. After I completed that; I resumed pilot monitoring duties for the remainder of the flight. Captain executed the RNAV XXL approach to land smoothly and uneventfully; the landing was very soft. We stopped on the runway and waited for Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to approach the airplane and conduct a visual inspection. ARFF communicated with us directly on Tower frequency and told us there were no indications of fire or leaking fluids. We taxied to the ramp and gate with ARFF on the trail as a precaution.,A320 flight crew reported an engine failure and a return to the departure airport

At 3 white and 1 red indicators on the PAPI; the PF vocalized high and correcting. At approximately 75 ft. the descent rate slowed; the aircraft continued to drift above the glideslope and a long landing was looking probable. The PF continued to vocalize correcting. Once the aircraft was outside the touchdown zone and a long landing was evident; the PM (Pilot Monitoring) called for a go around. At the same time a call for go around was initiated; the PF had reduced the thrust levers to idle. As the PF initiated the go around; the Main Landing Gear momentarily touched the runway. During the pitch up and engine spool up; the PM felt a bump indicating a possible tailstrike. ATC gave an initial heading and altitude to climb to; as well as a new runway assignment. The PF loaded the ILS for the new runway and sent for landing data since the runway was significantly shorter. During the vectors to intercept; the PM vocalized that his side was not receiving the signal from the ILS frequency. The PF said his side was receiving the signal. ATC gave a vector to intercept; and again; the PM vocalized that the signal was not being received on his side. The aircraft passed through the LOC course and ATC gave a new heading to intercept. The PF acknowledged he was not receiving the signal and the PM loaded the RNAV approach to the runway to provided course and vertical guidance. Once the approach was loaded; the second approach was successful. After arriving at the gate; the PM conducted a post-flight walk-around and discovered damage to the tail stinger.,B737 flight crew reported an unstabilized approach resulted in a go-around as the aircraft touched down on the runway. As the aircraft performed the go around; the First Officer felt a bump indicative of a tail strike. The aircraft landed and upon post flight inspection damage was discovered to the tail stinger.

At approximately 130 kt. the aircraft felt like the left side surged up in and then back down; then the left engine spooled back. I felt like we lost one or both tires. I called that out to the Captain. They agreed and called for a rejection. I responded with; Agree reject."" Then called; ""Extended and deployed."" Then; ""Autobrake disarm.' We were stopped before I could call out the speed. I radioed the Tower that we had rejected on the runway and to standby. The Captain said wait and made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated. Then we reviewed the lights and status. We had no engine fire indication. But the left engine N1 was zero. I am not sure on what checklist we did or didn't do in that window. The CA (Captain) said I think we can taxi so I coordinated with the Tower to move off on the taxiway. And I [requested priority handling] and told them to send the fire trucks. When stopped on the taxiway I told the Fire Lead that the left engine and wheels were the concern.They checked them out; and said that they saw smoke coming from the left engine. The Fire Lead said they would inspect the left. The Captain and I agreed immediately to fire a bottle into the engine. There was still no fire indication. I ran the brake cooling while sitting on the taxiway. After the fire team cleared us from being on fire we asked for a place to park before returning to the gate; as directed by the brake cooling. We taxied on one engine to the Maintenance Ramp. There we sat while the fire team monitored the exterior. The Captain was on the phone with several company people while I monitored the fire team. Several minutes later the Fire Lead said that there was smoke coming from the engine and the temperature was rising. They said they were using a thermal monitor. I informed the Captain that I was firing the second bottle and they gave me the thumbs up. The Fire Lead would not let us return to the gate until they were confident we were not on-fire. They opened engine cowlings and then gave us the clear and moved the fire personnel out of the way. We taxied it to the gate.""",B737-800 flight crew reported the number one engine malfunctioned during the takeoff roll; resulting in a high-speed rejected takeoff.

After Maintenance cleared the aircraft we departed ZZZ approximately 2 hours late. On the departure we experienced a high engine vibration event and subsequently [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ with one engine at idle thrust. Then; we taxied to the gate and deplaned the passengers.,A320 First Officer reported performing a rejected takeoff and returning to the gate for maintenance. After being cleared by Maintenance and taking off a second time; the flight crew experienced a high engine vibration. The flight crew then returned to the airport with one engine on idle thrust.

Followed company procedures and ECAM actions. A subsequent HYD G ENG 1 PUMP LO PR ECAM occurred.  Advised ATC; requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) and a return to ZZZ to land on Runway XXR. Dispatch; flight attendants and passengers were notified. Followed ECAM actions to lower the gear. Gear extended normally. Requested ZZZ approach to vector us off the final to rejoin to burn fuel so the landing would occur under maximum landing weight. No new or reoccurring ECAMS and all systems operated normally to a safe landing and taxi. ARFF did not see any visible issues and followed us to the gate. Deplaned the passengers safely via the jet bridgeThere were no issues related to the HYD issue we encountered prior to the the event happening. This was a mechanical failure. I don't know if this could have been prevented.,A321 pilot reported receiving ECAM's for the hydraulic system during the departure climb and made a subsequent return to the departure airport.

We leveled off at 10000 ft. and ran the engine limit; surge; stall checklist. No exceedances were observed on any of the engine gauges; just a momentary N1 drop. After running the QRH checklist; the engine was stable. I called the Flight Attendants and asked them if they saw or smelled anything abnormal in the cabin. They responded that everything seemed normal; and nothing seemed out of the ordinary; except for the actual compressor stall. We elected to climb to FL 230 and continue to assess what happened. I was in the process of typing an ACARS message to Dispatch when we were climbing through 15000 ft. The engine experienced another compressor stall at this time; and we immediately advised ATC and requested a return to ZZZ. As we made the turn towards the airport the number two engine EGT spiked into the red and the engine fail icon appeared. We performed the engine fire; severe damage QRC; followed by the QRH. We secured the engine. At this point I made a PA explaining the situation to the passengers and also talked to the Flight Attendants. Sent a quick ACARS message to Dispatch telling them we were single engine and returning to ZZZ. ATC coordinated crash and rescue equipment for Runway XXL. We landed on Runway XXL; had fire and rescue look over the aircraft once on the taxiway to make sure everything was ok outside before proceeding to the gate. PAs were made; keeping passengers informed on what was going on. Taxied to the gate.,B737-700 flight crew and Dispatcher reported multiple compressor stalls during climb required and engine shut down. Flight returned to the departure airport and landed normally.

Non-normal procedures and methodology were followed. The generator did not reset and the APU was started to return to a 2 generator operation. After a few minutes we received another ECAM APU AUTO SHUTDOWN. Non-normal procedures and methodology were again applied. We were now down to 1 generator; so we advised ZZZ Center and made the decision to divert to ZZZ1. We also informed Dispatch; and communicated with the Flight Attendants and passengers of our status and our intent to make a precautionary landing in ZZZ1. After landing; we had the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) team at ZZZ1 inspect the aircraft and then we proceeded to taxi to the gate. Entries were made into the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML) regarding the two non-normals that we experienced. The cause is the generator failing to reset; combined with the shutdown of the APU left us in a situation where we could not continue the flight to the planned destination. No suggestions; as we had the unfortunate instance of having the APU auto-shutdown; while serving as a replacement for generator 1. I had just finished communicating the generator's failure to reset with the Dispatcher/Maintenance to see if they were in agreement to continue to ZZZZ. We then had the APU auto-shutdown ECAM; which led to the diversion to ZZZ1.,A319 Captain reported an ECAM ELEC GEN 1 FAULT followed by an ECAM APU AUTO SHUTDOWN during climb. After coordinating with ATC; the flight diverted to a suitable airport for landing.

I immediately reduced thrust on both engines as the engine with the problem was not yet identified and we were at climb power but now leveling at 3000 ft. We advised ATC and asked for a return to ZZZ airport. We identified the #2 engine had less than 1 qt of oil quantity. The engine thrust was then brought to idle. A visual approach to Runway XX in ZZZ was made and we stopped on the runway to allow the Airport Rescue & Firefighting (ARF) equipment to look the plane over. With the ARF in place; we shut down the #2 engine. The appropriate checklists were accomplished and the ARF followed us to the gate.,A319 pilot reported multiple bangs and significant yawing during climb with the #2 engine showing 1 quart of oil. Pilot reduced thrust to idle; returned to airport; and shut engine down after a normal landing.

Captain directed First Officer (FO) to continue as the Pilot Flying (PF) and Captain to complete the Non-normal checklist. Captain notified Dispatch of the situation and the possible need for a diversion. The EQUIP SMOKE light remained on and the checklist directed crew to make a landing at the nearest suitable airport. The Captain; First Officer and Dispatch all agreed on ZZZ as the best choice for diversion.  Captain requested priority handling with ATC; gave them the SOB's; fuel remaining; no hazmat and requested new clearance for direct ZZZ. ATC cleared the flight via right turn direct ZZZ. Captain briefed Flight Attendants with Company Checklist and briefed passengers for unplanned landing.  Flight proceeded uneventfully to ZZZ landing safely on Runway XXL. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) had been requested by the flight crew. Crew was instructed to stop on runway to allow ARFF team to inspect aircraft. All clear was given and aircraft taxied safely to the gate followed by ARFF.  Crew conducted informal debriefing. Captain and First Officer thanked everyone involved for their excellent performance.,B737 NG Captain reported EQUIP SMOKE light illuminated inflight.

We immediately got clearance to stop the climb and descend immediately. ATC issued an immediate clearance to 16;000; and then subsequently cleared us to 11;000 and then again to 10;000. There was no delay getting to 10;000. Crew ran the 'Unscheduled Pressurization Change' checklist. There was no Master Caution light and the Auto Fail light was not illuminated. Flight Attendants (FA) notified us that the passenger oxygen masks deployed automatically. We were able to regain control of the cabin pressurization through the checklist and manual system operation. We returned to ZZZ uneventfully and conducted a Flaps 30 overweight landing on Runway XXC and returned to the gate. I am unaware of anyone requiring medical attention following the incident.,Air carrier Captain reported a pressurization system malfunction during climb that required a descent and return to the departure airport.

Both engines were operating. Aircraft then rolled in 4 units right aileron. The aircraft developed a buffet. Airspeed is good. SPOILERS EICAS annunciation. We [requested priority handling]. I was flying and had radios while the First Officer (FO) ran the checklist. We determined the #4; 11 spoilers failed in the unlocked position. I handed aircraft to FO and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance. We decided to divert to ZZZ; autopilot was disconnected and the aircraft was hand flown. Relief Pilot returned to the flight deck and figured out landing data for our malfunction. Overweight landing checklist was followed. Diversion guide was reviewed. Flight Attendants were notified and brief items were reviewed. Passengers were briefed. FO handed me the aircraft while being vectored to final. Normal flaps 30 landing ensued. Maintenance write ups included SPOILERS EICAS message; FLIGHT CONTROL SYS status message; spoilers failed; overweight landing; and RECIRC FAN status message. We were 62 miles from ZZZ when this happened. The crew did an exemplary job flying; managing tasks; advocating; and supporting me in every way. The relief pilot was fresh off IOE. Being woken up and returning to an priority in progress is challenging. They rose to the challenge and were an asset immediately accomplishing necessary tasks quickly and efficiently. The old timer of my crew with XX years on the 777; performed to the highest standard. They were instrumental in analyzing the situation; managing checklists; and then managing our descent into ZZZ while hand flying. Our purser was flying their first trip as a purser. Bless their heart; they could not believe this was happening but when I said Brief; they immediately knew what that meant and jumped into action professionally and effectively managing the crew and cabin. Overall I am very proud of this crew and honored to have had the privilege to work with them.,B777 Captain reported two flight spoilers deployed in the unlocked position during cruise. Captain requested priority handling and diverted after accomplishing appropriate checklists.

At 33;000 [ft.] off the coast of State A; we lost #4 and #11 spoiler and left flapperon. Left spoiler deployed. We [requested priority handling] and landed in ZZZ. At XA00; after staying with passengers until a plan was formulated to take care of them; I turned my attention to getting crew to hotel. I talked to Chief Pilot and was told they couldn't help us until we were released. I said I would call in fatigued as we were fatigued to be released. Crew desk said that was not necessary as they released us so we could fly the plane back to ZZZ1 after repairs. No fatigue call was entered into my schedule. We operated all segments assigned.,B777 flight crew reported malfunction of spoiler system and loss of spoiler panels inflight.

I had just finished a two-day the previous day out of ZZZ; where we were delayed getting back into ZZZ by almost 5 hours due to weather. So I was hoping for a simple day trip to ZZZZ today. That simply was not the case. I arrived at the airport for our report time at XA:50. I was able to meet with the CA (Captain) and discuss the upcoming day and flight. We met the previous crew of our aircraft on the jet bridge who went into great detail about the current MEL items on that specific aircraft. After discussing the situation with the crew and Dispatch; the CA and I both felt that it was the best course to not take this aircraft to ZZZZ due to the MEL items on the aircraft. We then waited another 3 or so hours for the next aircraft to become available. The CA and I boarded the new aircraft to find that there was an inbound write-up on the aircraft in regards to the brake pressure accumulator not being able to hold pressure and had lost about 800 psi in about 30 minutes. Maintenance personnel then boarded that flight and performed a test on the aircraft to see what the issue was and if it could be deferred or if the issue was more complex. The test took roughly 45 minutes to see if the brake pressure would hold or not. Maintenance informed the CA and I that the aircraft did not pass the test and would need to be taken out of service. The time now is roughly XG:30. The CA and I have been at the airport roughly 6 hours and are now looking for our 3rd aircraft to take to ZZZZ. However duty period was now an issue. We later received a phone call from Scheduling who informed us that we will now be going to ZZZ1 because we would not be legal to operate the previous flight to ZZZZ and back to ZZZ2.The CA and I again boarded our new flight to ZZZ1. We got everything ready to only have the Ramp close for about 30 minutes due to the storms in the area. Once the storms cleared we were able to push back from gate. However; due to the construction behind the gate; the Tow Driver needed to tow us in a specific area to clear the construction. We informed the driver of where to go but he was very confused and it was clear that he may not have gotten the proper training for towing in this area with the construction. Due to this confusion we ended up breaking the shear pin on the push. So we had to get Maintenance to come out and verify everything was ok before continuing on with the pushback. Once given the ok to go from Maintenance; we were able to push back to the proper area and commence the flight.The time now is roughly XJ:15 and we were on our way for departure after 8.5 hours of delays and changes. There were still so many storms in the direction of which we were going but ZZZ2 was clear. We departed with no issues. We performed the after-takeoff check and continued our climb to 10;000 ft. It was around 8;000 ft. that the CA decided to put the autopilot on by pressing Command A. The autopilot engaged. I was the pilot monitoring and received a clearance to continue climb to 18;000 ft. At that moment within 30 - 60 seconds of the autopilot being on; there was a sudden violent jolt and pitch down of the aircraft. The autopilot remained engaged. The CA and I looked at each other trying to understand what just happened. The aircraft then did the same jolt and pitch down. The CA then clicked off the autopilot. We told ATC that we want to remain at 10;000 ft. and that we had a flight control issue. The CA and I then tried Command B autopilot. It appeared to be working normally. We then tried Command A autopilot and again within 30 - 60 seconds the jolt and nose down pitch occurred. We then saw the stab out of trim light appear. We ran through the checklist and decided that it was best to go back to ZZZ2 at that time. We advised ATC and got vectors back to ZZZ2. We notified Dispatch; the FAs (Flight Attendant); and customers. We did a great job using CRM to really divide and conquer at this time. We wouldmeet back and regroup with each other. We ran the overweight checklist and proceeded to land at ZZZ2 with no issues. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) verified the aircraft was ok on the taxiway before proceeding to the gate.,B737 flight crew reported experiencing an abrupt pitch down event when engaging the autopilot system; resulting in an immediate return to the departure airport.

The Captain made a landing where it was met with vehicles. Passengers safely deplaned as well as the flight crew. The flight crew did experience headaches and a strange taste in their throat. They were examined and advised by medics. This airplane had a fume event prior to our departure; which delayed our departure by 22 hours and 45 minutes out of a ZZZZ. Perhaps a more comprehensive inspection is in order for the aircraft.,A321 Flight Attendant and Captain reported a fumes event during initial approach for landing.

My airspeed rolled back quickly. (below 170 knots). Airplane went into control wheel steering. IAS disagree was enunciated. I looked over at the FO's primary flight display and she was near redline. Our altitudes disagreed by nearly 3;000 feet. I knew immediately it was airspeed unreliable. Performed recall and QRC items. I was in a descent in IMC so I set the N1 to 80% and pitch to 4 degrees. Asked ATC for a block altitude. Also verified my altitude and ground speed with ATC continuously. After performing QRC and QRH it was determined that my side was the erroneous side. Assigned flying duties to the FO. I [requested priority handling] and chose ZZZ1 as a diversion destination instead of ZZZ2. Completed non routine landing considerations and safely landed in ZZZ1. On a side note: I would like to take this opportunity to commend our training department. I have practiced this exact scenario in the sim and it played out in real life virtually the same. Because it was practiced in the sim my startle factor was not nearly as high. Cause - Mechanical malfunction.Suggestions - Nothing could have prevented this. After speaking with maintenance it was determined that the #1 ADIRU failed.,B737-800 Captain reported an air data computer failure causing erratic and conflicting readings of airspeed and altitude between the Captain and First Officer's flight instruments. The Captain determined via checklist that the failed instruments were on the Captain side and assigned flying duties to the FO. The FO maintained the flight manual pitch and attitude guidelines; validated airspeed and altitude with ATC; and diverted to a longer runway airport. The flight landed safely at the alternate airport.

There was a 'bang.' Jet yawed to the left. First Officer (F/O) said 'We just lost #1.' I replied; 'I have the aircraft; Engine Failure Checklist'. I then keyed the MIC; informing Center that we'd lost #1 Engine and needed to return to ZZZ. I [requested priority]. We ran appropriate checklists; returned to ZZZ for uneventful single-engine landing.,Air carrier flight crew reported the number one engine failure during initial climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

We taxied back to an available apron area to contact Dispatch and Maintenance Control to work on the issue.  After conferring with Maintenance Control we cycled the circuit breakers that Maintenance Control instructed us to cycle.  This did not fix the problem.  Upon further research Maintenance Control informed us that the issue could be deferred.  A deferral [was] made and a new release was sent to the aircraft.An uneventful takeoff and initial departure was made.Just prior to level off; the SPD LIM indication in the Captain's PFD was noticed to illuminate occasionally but only for a brief period of a couple-of-seconds.Level off at cruise altitude of 34;000 feet was uneventful.  All other indications and instruments were working properly; including all primary and secondary airspeed instruments.  As a precaution; we reviewed immediate action items; and follow on procedures of 'AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE' checklist.  At this time the only non-normal indications were a single channel AUTO SLAT FAIL light when the Master Caution recall was checked; and a very seldom intermittent SPD LIM  flag only on the Captain's PFD.  The First Officer was already the pilot flying so we continued with these flying positions.Once we were over the X area; the SPD LIM light illuminated more often and for longer periods of time.  It was more steady on; than off.  Soon thereafter we experienced a very brief (less than two seconds) 'stick shaker'; and very soon thereafter the Captain's PFD intermittently displayed brief over speed indications.  We again reviewed the Flight Manual and checklist for 'Unreliable Airspeed.'  At this point all of the First Officer's instruments were normal; all airspeed indicators agreed.We again contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control and discussed the malfunction.  No resolution or fix was offered by Maintenance Control so the flight crew conferred and decided to divert.  After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance Control on the best divert options; ZZZ1 chosen.  As the flight continued to ZZZ1; all intermittent issues became more frequent.An uneventful visual approach and landing was made on Runway XXL at ZZZ1; followed by taxi to an available gate.  After maintenance made an initial assessment of the issues; it was decided by Customer Service; Maintenance; and Ramp to deplane the passengers and accommodate them all on a later flight to ZZZ.The only frustrating issue during the entire event was the fact that multiple ATC agencies (multiple Center controls as well as Approach Control) did not pass on to each other that we had [priority handling] and were an '[priority handling] aircraft!'  Center even tried to vector us north of ZZZ1 for 'at least 4 minutes!'I may not have initially checked onto the frequency as a [priority handling] aircraft; and not until I told Center that the vectors were unacceptable and that we were a [priority handling] did we receive priority handling.  Center apologized and said they had not been informed.  The same thing happened with Approach Control.The only thing I would have changed in this scenario was to ensure I used the label [priority handling] to ensure priority each and every transmission to ATC.,B737 NG Captain reported they received intermittent SPD LIM and AUTO SLAT FAIL warnings at cruise altitude.  The warnings became steady and soon after the crew experienced a stick shaker and an over speed indication displayed on the Captain's side.  The flight crew decided to divert to the nearest suitable airport.

En route; we experienced a failure of DISPLAY SOURCE 1 on the Captain's PFD (Primary Flight Display). The Captain ran the QRH while I continued to fly. The QRH directed that the EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) be placed in ALTN mode; and that the Captain's Flight Director data was possibly unreliable. We then completed normal arrival preparations and continued. This failure was discussed with our Arrival Briefing going into ZZZ and was factored into our decision making. We began the arrival with ATC vectors around Cumulonimbus build ups and were vectored for the ILS Runway XX into ZZZ. As the aircraft leveled off; we were vectored for a base turn for the approach when the STAB OUT OF TRIM annunciator came on. The autopilot and autothrottles were disconnected and I hand-flew and manually trimmed; as the Captain re-configured for a Flaps 15 Approach and landing for Runway XX into ZZZ. At this time; I began to help the Captain complete the STAB OUT OF TRIM QRH and The Captain ran speeds for a Flaps 15; manually flown and trimmed approach and landing; along with brake cooling data for XX. Once we configured; the Captain called ATC; [requested priority handling]; briefed the flight attendants and made an announcement to the passengers over this Public Address System. I continued to hand-fly the vectors assigned by ATC and was vectored to the north of the airport for the RNAV GPS (Y) Runway XY Approach. I informed ATC we were not set up for the approach; but they advised us that Runway XX was closed. The Captain then re-ran a landing performance assessment for Runway XY; braking cooling data and loaded the approach for RNAV GPS (Y) XY.I continued to accept delay vectors and deviated around build ups. After we were configured and ready for the approach; the Captain assumed pilot flying duties and I took over pilot monitoring duties. I called ATC; advised we were ready for the approach; and we commenced. We completed the deferred before landing items out of the QRH; which included the Flap Inhibit switch being placed to INHIBIT and normal Before Landing Checklist. We were asked by ATC if we had the field in sight. We did and continued. Inside the Final Approach Fix ZZZZZ and at a 1000 ft. AGL; I made standard visual approach callouts. We were on speed and stabilized at 1000 ft. Only at the short final point; around 400 ft.; did I notice we were around 10 knots fast. The Captain noticed this and corrected; by reducing thrust all the way to the idle detent and we never lost the speed until touchdown. We braked normally; turned off the runway and had Airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting meet the aircraft to check our brake temperatures. After we deemed it safe to approach the gate; XX; we heard on Tower frequency that another Company aircraft went around behind us; due to Windshear Warning and microburst activity was reported. The field was shut down to all arrivals and departures after this point. We parked normally from there. We handled the situation safely and coordinated duties that got the aircraft on the ground safely.,B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported while preparing for approach; the aircraft alerting system displayed a reliability issue with the Captain's PFD and a Stab Out of Trim warning. The flight crew continued to landing at destination airport.

I asked if there was any smoke or fire. They said there wasn't but the smell was very strong and not dissipating at all. At this point I made the decision to request priority handling and divert to ZZZ. We turned around and started down and ran all of our checklist including the overweight landing checklist.  The I reached out again to the FAs and said I needed to know if any smoke started appearing at all. They said they would. They were given a priority code and we prepped for landing. Unfortunately with all that was going on I failed to notice they turned us in about 5 miles closer then I expected.  Due to this we ended up being much to high for the landing. Since we didn't have an actual fire at this point I felt it was safer to go around instead of forcing a bad landing.  We went around and then came back for a smooth overweight landing.  After landing we stopped on the high speed and I had the fire trucks position behind us and look for any signs.  I had the aft FA go back into the lav to check again.The strong electrical smell and the heat continued with no reduction in intensity. I told the Airport Rescue and Firefighting to stay close and follow us in as I felt it was safer at this point to deplane normally. I told them if we got any indication of smoke we would immediately stop and evacuate.  We got to the gate and again I felt it safer to remove all passengers thru the Jetway and then have the firemen inspect the lav. Upon inspection they found the water heater to be at fault and basically running away as hot as it would go. It was so hot that the hot water coming out was 130 degrees and even the cold water was 108 degrees. For reference the other lav showed 80 hot water. The end result was a safe landing with no evacuation needed. I did make the mistake of not realizing we were as close as we were so ultimately the only thing I would have done different would have been to verify how far out we were being vectored.  In the future I will attempt to look at that more closely. However a very strong mitigating factor was the possibility of this turning into a fire. Ultimately it did not luckily.,Air carrier Captain reported cabin odor and walls in the aft lavatory were extremely hot; as reported by the aft Flight Attendant. After a divert; a missed approach due to arriving too high on final and then an overweight landing; the aircraft arrived safely. The Fire Marshal and maintenance determined the aft water heater was running uncontrolled full power and overheating.

When following the Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM) procedure for the disagreement through FL210 we got an Adivsory indication flashing on the E/WD. The ENG page was up on the SD and QTY was flashing. The oil quantity was quickly decreasing from 3 qts. Within a few seconds while looking up the ECAM Advisory for oil quantity; I started noticing the oil pressure had decreased from 44 psi then started fluctuating from 30 psi to 25 psi and then started quickly dropping. The oil quantity indications had dropped and amber xx's replaced the indication. Within a few seconds the oil pressure dropped below red line and the Master Warning with repetitive chime came on. ECAM ENG 2 Low Oil PR appeared. We then proceeded to follow the ECAM actions. The ECAM directed us to shut down ENG 2. We then went through each secondary failure listed with the engine shutdown. After the engine was secured and preliminary ECAM actions were completed we stopped ECAM; leveled off at our assigned altitude of FL230 and I contacted ATC [requesting priority handling] due to having to shut down ENG 2. I requested to divert to ZZZ due to the facilities available and the longer runways. While talking to ATC the First Officer (FO) talked to the lead Flight Attendant (FA). ATC directed us to fly heading 150 and descend to 13;000 ft. We then ran the approach checklist and set the plane up for approach into ZZZ. The FO ran the landing performance for single engine Runway XXC. I requested Runway XXC due to the length of the runway. While I was flying and talking to ATC the FO was going through the FCOM procedure for ENG Low Oil PR ECAM. I made an announcement to the passengers that we had to shutdown the engine due to a mechanical issue and were diverting to ZZZ. I asked the passengers to remain seated and we would update them once we landed in ZZZ. I requested vectors for the RNAV XXC. While descending; the FO continued going through the overweight landing checklist and then the single engine straight in approach checklist. After the checklist were completed; we requested vectors to the approach. We landed normally with no issues and then taxied off the runway under our own power. We performed the after landing checklist and turned on the brake fans as instructed by the overweight landing checklist. I stopped on the taxiway just clear of the runway and emergency personnel drove around the aircraft and checked the #2 engine. The emergency personnel reported back that the #2 engine was leaking fluid. We were then instructed by ground to taxi into the ramp area and they wanted us to go to Gate XXX.,A320 flight crew reported the R Engine on was shutdown inflight because of a loss of oil quantity and pressure. The pilots successfully diverted to a nearby airport.

Shortly after we saw it again and it was clear that multiple relays seem to be malfunctioning; but more this time. I was able to see over the next couple occurrences that the TAT (Total Air Temperature) and SAT (Static Air Temperature) indicators; CA (Captain) outlet; FMGS1; ND1 (Navigation Display 1); VHF1 on FO (First Officer) side also went out temporarily. I called back to ask the FAs (Flight Attendants) if they noticed anything; and they hadn't yet; but on the third occurrence; they reported the WIFI and the lights were flickering. About the 3rd or 4th occurrence (they happened quickly in a fairly short span of time) that my FMGS1 was now out as well as the Fuel Used numbers were reset and Fuel used for engine 2 indicators also ambered out. At this point I had asked the lead FA to do a sweep of the cabin to see if they see or smell smoke or hear anything suspicious. I had remembered that a pattern of electrical anomalies can be a possible sign of electrical fire; so I had begun to plan for that. Shortly after the lead FA said that there was a strange buzzing sound over row XX (where the Wi-Fi is) and a strange smell of possible smoke. At this point while still on the line with the FA; I gave him a briefing; and as I had seen ZZZ as the closest airport; fortunately with maintenance as well; telling him that is where we are going; [advising ATC] (while coordinating with the FO who was the flying pilot). At this point; I had decided to prepare for a possible electrical fire; and we rapidly descended from our cruise altitude of FL370. We were about 10 min away and did our duties preparing for the landing; calling the fire trucks as a precautionary method. As electrical fire is a dire situation; I was not going to hesitate; as dispatch and Maintenance Control was not fully aware of what was going on; although I did briefly send a few ACARS messages explaining it. They had suggested ZZZ1; but it was about 30 min away. I called for ZZZ while dispatch/Maintenance Control coordinated well to prepare for the landing in ZZZ. We landed safely with a full stop on the runway; completing all SOPs. Fire trucks pulled the infrared sensors and noted no heat anomalies; and we were cleared to the gate. On arrival Maintenance Control stated they received a message from our aircraft that the ENG1 IDG (Integrated Drive Generator) had failed. We had not seen that message; and while it may have popped up briefly; I did hit the recall button multiple times showing normal during the events on the flight. We had deplaned immediately on gate arrival; fire fighters did a full infrared/temperature screening twice of the interior and exterior and found no heat anomalies. It was concluded that the ENG1 IDG had or was failing; so we did an engine run to confirm and deactivate the IDG.,Airbus A320 air carrier pilot reported electrical problems while climbing to cruise altitude. The crew coordinated with the cabin crew to troubleshoot the problem; diverted; and landed safely.

As I got strapped in and began assessing the situation the oil temperature proceeded to turn red and was pinned in the red for over 30 seconds while the Captain already had the high oil temperature QRH procedure out which stated if red proceed to shutdown engine 1 checklist.  We noticed the oil quantity dipped as low as 3 qts while descending/diverting and after about 1 minute in the red the oil temperature number indication went blank.  We proceeded with the engine shutdown checklist.  Notified ATC; Dispatch the Flight Attendants for a precautionary landing and eventually the passengers.  We followed all non normal and normal checklist then we landed in ZZZ followed by Airport Firefighting parked all of which was uneventful and smooth.  We made the log entry talked with our Chief Pilots; Dispatch and Mechanics while making a log entry of the event. The main factor was the high oil temperature then low oil quantity.  Outside of that the rest of the diversion went smoothly.  I believe we operated professionally; followed SOPs and made a safe diversion and landing.  We believe this was purely mechanical and the high oil temperature was out of our control.,737-800 First Officer reported rising oil temperature on the #1 engine; resulting in an engine shutdown and a single-engine diversion.

Cabin altitude was verified to be over 11000 ft. and the descent memory items were applied; and descent was initiated down to 10000 ft. MSL. The maximum cabin altitude observed was just over 11000 ft.  A normal landing was made in ZZZ. We taxied to the gate and offloaded passengers without incident. I had the paramedics standing by in the event anyone may have suffered any side effects from the rapid descent in the cabin. No complaints were observed. None.,A319 Captain reported a cabin altitude warning during descent for landing.  Crew performed flight manual procedures and landed normally.

As the aircraft descended; both bleed lights came on. The FO (First Officer) the QRH procedure and each item was completed. Both crew members noticed the duct pressure at zero; so as the pilot flying I extended the speed brake to bring the power up.  This did not work as the duct pressure remained at zero. At about 22;000 feet the cabin altitude horn came on. We advised ATC and were cleared down to 10;000 feet. At 10;000 feet I called the flight attendants to see if the masks had fallen; but they had not. While speaking with the flight attendants; it became apparent that only the pilots knew what had happened. We landed at ZZZ on runway XX without further incident.We should have advised tower at ZZZ; since they tried to slow us down and treat us as a normal flight.There was a recent write-up in the book with the same problem. Maybe more information could have been provided so maintenance could have found the problem.,B737-800 flight crew reported a loss of cabin pressure during descent when thrust was reduced to idle. Flight crew continued descent and landed at destination airport.

Temperatures returned to normal after reduction to climb thrust. Overheat ECAMs disappeared but ENG 2 OVERLIMIT ECAM appeared. We chose not to shut down engine 2 even though the ECAM procedure required it because engine 1 had also overheated and we were concerned that it could subsequently fail if placed under a high load which would leave us with no engines and the loss of XX souls. Diversion to ZZZ1 was uneventful. A deeper look into the aircraft history shows multiple overheats and a temperature over limit as well. Some reference to an EGT monitoring program can also be found in the logbook. Yet this dangerous aircraft; which should not even be flying; was sent to ZZZ knowing that the longer runway was closed and a high thrust setting would be required to depart. This is not an isolated case; I had previously refused to fly an aircraft with 5 overheats in the recent history in the logbook. I was told that our incident produced a temperature 1 degree shy of a mandatory engine change; yet the airplane was out flying the next day. What is Maintenance waiting for with these engines? Fix or replace engines sooner than actual failure,A321 flight crew reported dual engine overheat during climbout. Flight crew elected to divert.

We [advised ATC] through the help of other aircraft who were in closer range and had established communication with ZZZ1; we descended from FL310 to FL210 for single engine our single engine altitude; I took over the flying duties while the Captain ran the checklists; communicated to ATC; Dispatch; flight attendants; our passenger onboard and also two DH (Dead Head) pilots. After communicating with Dispatch; we came to an agreement ZZZZ would be our diversion airport. We were given priorities and direct to ZZZZ; rescue equipment were requested to standby in the event we do need it. Once all notifications were made; Captain took over flying duties as pilot flying and performed a safe landing into ZZZZ.,B737 First Officer reported high EGT on number 2 engine in cruise. Crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

We scanned the aircraft while making sure we were not getting into a stall situation. The LE (Leading Edge) FLAPS TRANSIT light was on and the number 4 amber light in the upper flight controls panel was also on. We went thru the QRH procedure; contacted Dispatch and Maintenance. the QRH made us go down to flight level 200 pull flaps to 1 then back to UP to see if it would reset. the light remained on and talking to Dispatch we made a decision to continue to ZZZ. we would be landing with about an hour of fuel and no weather or other conditions were affecting ZZZ. We had positive control of the aircraft at all times. Another Company pilot had checked the wing as well as the Captain and it didn't seem like a significant difference between that LE FLAP and the rest of them. Once with ZZZ approach we told them that we required Runway XX and our final approach speed would be around 175 knots. ATC Then decided to treat it as [priority handling] at that point so we gave souls on board and fuel. CA (Captain) landed the plane without further incident.,B737 First Officer reported uncommanded leading edge flap deployment in cruise flight. Flight crew made an uneventful landing at destination.

We recognized the pressurization issue due to our ears popping and feeling pressure. We looked at the pressurization screen and seen the cabin altitude at negative 4;400 ft. and the VSI moving erratically up a down reaching negative 3;900 ft. at one point. This was followed by a master caution CAM CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT. The outflow valve showed completely closed; and the safety valve showed completely open. We followed the ECAM to manually operate the outflow valve by using the manual vertical speed. This however; did not work. We did an urgent decent from 24;000 feet to 8;000 ft. and [requested priority handling] straight to ZZZ. We continued to troubleshoot the problem with no success. Upon landing on Runway XXR in ZZZ; making a turn off; our ears were still popping and feeling pressure. The cabin altitude still showed negative 4;400 ft. and a differential pressure psi of 2.5. After turning both packs off this still did not fix the problem. I asked the First Officer (FO) if he could open his cockpit window to depressurize the aircraft. The First Officer was unable to open his window. I was finally able to open my window and depressurize the airplane. We continued to taxi to the gate. No injuries reported just inner ear discomfort from Crew and Passengers. We filled out the logbook and gave a full brief of our issue to maintenance and left the aircraft.,A320 Captain reported pressurization problems and being unable to rectify the issue with manual mode as per ECAM.  After landing crew was unable to depressurize the aircraft on the ground until a cockpit window was opened after air conditioning packs were selected to off.

We elected not to raise the gear as the aircraft was performing well and didn't want to make the situation worse by bringing loose tread into the wheel well. At about 800 ft the FA's called the flightdeck and I answered briefly to say that we blew a tire/everything was going to be ok and that we'd call them back. The F/O (First Officer) notified the Tower that we had indications of a blown tire on takeoff and requested a straight out departure.  Initially; I called for flaps up after accelerating at about 1500 ft AGL. Once the flaps were up the takeoff configuration horn alerted so we brought the flaps back to 1. During initial radar vectors; we advised ATC and stated that we'd need to return to ZZZ but needed time to coordinate and run checklists. The only other indication that we had of gear problems was the ANTI SKID INOP light was illuminated. I handed the control of the aircraft and the radios to the F/O so that I could make a PA to the Passengers; coordinate with ops; the FA's and reference the AOM/QRH. I made a quick PA and called the FAs; which was when I was told that a ceiling panel had come loose and injured 2 of our Passengers but that they were stable. We let ATC know we had injuries and provided the info that we had. At this point I referenced the AOM for landing gear tire failure on takeoff. I read the high points of that section to the F/O; so that we were on the same page; while waiting for ops to set up a patch with Dispatch. I was also busy coordinating with our F/As; Jumpseater (Company Captain) on how best to stow the loose ceiling panel such that I wouldn't impede egress. Subsequent to that; the Master Caution illuminated for the #1 ENG HYD LOW PRESS.  The F/O pointed out that the pressure was good but that the QTY was low and decreasing. Initially we elected to run the LOSS of SYSTEM A Checklist; figuring it was only a matter of time but decided to back out of that checklist since we still had good steady pressure even after the quantity read 0. We ran the #1 ENG HYD LOW PRESS checklist which directed us to turn off the pump. Once that was complete; we ran the Descent and Approach Checklists and asked for vectors to final. On about an eight-mile final; the Master Caution illuminated again; and we realized we were losing System A. We went around and asked for delay vectors again; while we ran the LOSS of SYSTEM A Checklist. Once that was complete; including performance data; we were vectored for landing. The landing was normal other than only getting one reverser and the shimmy from the blown tire. Directional control seemed normal; and braking was good; albeit slightly less than normal; which I expected. I had the F/O keep an eye on the accumulator pressure just in case. I also directed the F/O to start the APU. After slowing to about 30 knots and testing the tiller we told Tower we would exit the runway. I let the aircraft coast down the runway to exit. Upon slowing through approximately 20 knots; the aircraft started veering left and I couldn't maintain directional control. I stopped the aircraft as best I could with the nose ultimately 90 degrees to the left of centerline; but on the paved surface. B System Hydraulics registered 0 quantity. I then made a PA to the PAX to remain seated. Once the APU was on the busses; I shut down the engines and we started communications with CFR. They said there were no indications of fire; so we elected to keep the Passengers onboard the aircraft. The main thing we should have done differently is to have stopped straight ahead on the runway as expeditiously as we could have. I'm guessing the extra seconds we spent coasting down the runway was the time it took for the B System to lose quantity and pressure as well as the right brake to fail.,B737 flight crew reported a blown tire on takeoff as well as a hydraulic systems failure that required a return to the departure airport.

I transferred flying duties to the FO (First Officer) and began running the smoke; fire; or fumes checklist. The Relief Pilot returned to the flight deck and we continued the smoke; fire; or fumes checklist. The fumes were not increasing but were still noticeable and we could not identify the source; there was no smoke at any time. I contacted Dispatch and discussed the situation with the dispatcher and Maintenance Control. In consultation I decided to [request priority handling] and divert to ZZZ. The FAs (flight attendants) and passengers were informed of the situation and diversion. The FO performed an uneventful overweight landing. Firefighting services followed us to the gate and came on board. Their equipment sensed no hot spots. The passengers were deplaned.,B767 air carrier flight crew reported fumes in the cabin. Captain decided to divert and landed uneventfully.

I pulled up the non-normals (757)(767) GEAR DISAGREE procedure on my EFB and the Captain requested a level off at 5;000 from ATC. We ran through the procedure up to step 6 and then the Captain transferred the controls to the First Officer and contacted Dispatch. After discussing the situation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control; we decided a return to ZZZ with an overweight landing was the best course of action and [priority handling was requested] at that time. As we began diverting back to ZZZ; the Captain took control of the aircraft back and I continued with the (757)(767) GEAR DISAGREE procedure but when we went to lower the landing gear; we received no down and locked indication for the right main gear. Ultimately; we were led to an alternate gear extension per the procedure but that still did not give us a down and locked indication on the right main gear; but the GEAR DISAGREE EICAS message blanked and was replaced with a R SIDE BRACE EICAS message. We broke off the approach at that time and requested vectors to give ourselves more time to continue trouble shooting the issue. At this point; the Captain once again transferred control to the First Officer and contacted Dispatch while I began searching for R SIDE BRACE in the FM (flight manual) but I was unsuccessful in finding the correct procedure because it is titled (767) SIDE BRACE - L (R). During this second discussion with Dispatch and Maintenance Control; they were able to direct us to the proper procedure for R SIDE BRACE which we accomplished but still did not resolve our issue. We also reviewed the Partial or Gear Up Landing Procedure. At this point; the Chief Pilot and Boeing Engineering where patched in and we were told to try several maneuvers including speeding up and slowing down as well as steep turns to attempt to lock the gear in place but nothing fixed the issue. We were advised to conduct a Tower fly-by and after completion; were told that ground crews could see all the landing gear extended but there was no way to confirm that it was locked. After the fly-by; we contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control for a final time to report that the gear appeared to be down and the decision was made to burn off as much fuel as practicable and then return to ZZZ for landing. About 30 minutes before landing we told the flight attendants to prepare for a [priority] landing and possible evacuation. Once we were informed that that the flight attendants were ready we proceeded to the airport and safely landed without further incident on XXL. After coming to a stop; evaluation by emergency crews and company maintenance determined it was not safe to move the aircraft with passengers on board and we were all deplaned via mobile lounges.,B767 air carrier pilot reported gear disagree message after takeoff. After troubleshooting; flight crew decided to return to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

We followed QRH checklist procedures and performed a precautionary engine shutdown. We continued and landed at ZZZ. Fire and rescue team checked the outside of the engine and gave us the OK to continue to the gate. After the shutdown checklist was competed; the Captain made an MEL entry.I have no idea why the engine malfunction happened.Not sure what could be done to prevent this event from happening again.,B737-800 flight crew reported an Engine Number 2 malfunction before top of descent point and shut down the engine.

Noticed low oil quantity and searched for the QRH. There's only a Low Oil Pressure QRH. Captain and I decided to divert immediately. At first my iPad wasn't loading the airports; but the Captain recommended ZZZ. Once my iPad finally populated; I agreed. ZZZ1; at the time; was closer but we had nice tailwinds to ZZZ and still had oil. I don't remember actually saying that we are [requesting priority handling] but I did tell ATC souls on board as well as fuel and the issue. I did check in with the next Controller saying 'Company XXX [Priority] Aircraft.' Once we got closer to ZZZ; the quantity started to dwindle and we eventually ran the Low Pressure QRH; which led to a shutdown of the #2 Engine. Shut down the engine around 12;000 ft. and landed uneventfully.,B737-700 pilot reported a decreasing oil quantity indication while in cruise flight. Crew elected to divert and eventually shut the engine down as the quantity continued to decrease.

Autopilot and autothrust were both on during the climb/incident and remained activated through the engine stall.Requested an immediate level-off at FL220 and instructed ATC to vector us in the ZZZ area. After the engine rolled back; upper ECAM caution 'ENG 1 Stall' displayed; and duties designated for flying/radios/checklists. Then; the ECAM caution cleared prior to completing action items. Engine 1 regained normal thrust; and engine indications appeared normal. The QRH for Engine 1 stall was reviewed; as a precaution. At this moment the aft FAs (Flight Attendant) called and reported the loud bang and aircraft vibrations; as well as 'very loud' noise coming from door 2R. The noise was loud enough to be heard throughout the cabin. During this call the aft FA also mentioned the same door had a large hole in the door seal; and expressed significant concern because she could see outside. Flight crew immediately monitored pressurization and door indications. All appeared normal. Around this time [priority handling was requested] for the engine problem. Aircraft speed was reduced and landed uneventfully on Runway XXR. Taxied clear of the runway and stopped for a visual inspection from the ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) crew. All appeared normal; aircraft was taxied uneventfully to the gate and deplaned. Aircraft was squawked. Throughout the process; Dispatch was contacted via ARINC; FAs 'briefed;' and PAs for passengers made. Crew debrief completed. Chief Pilot/Dispatch/Maintenance Control all debriefed following the event also.,A319 flight crew reported hearing a loud bang and the airframe vibrating during climb-out; followed by Engine #1 rolling back to idle which made the aircraft yaw and bank. The flight attendants informed the flight crew there was a large hole in Door 2R; and a loud noise was coming from the affected door. The flight crew diverted to an alternate airport.

The air flow was accompanied by a loud rush of air and debris flying about the cockpit. We immediately stopped the climb and requested a descent to 10;000 feet. The cabin vertical speed was fluctuating with the pulsing of the airflow the hot air valve was noted in the closed position as per MEL. A call to the cabin confirmed the same conditions occurring in the cabin. The Flight Attendants were advised of our return to ZZZ for a normal landing. With several symptoms of a depressurization event we quickly got clearance to return to ZZZ for an uneventful landing and return to the gate. All normal checklists were completed. Landing data was received. The overweight landing checklist was referenced and complied with. Dispatch was advised via ACARS,Air carrier flight crew reported the loss of aircraft pressurization during climb. The QRH procedures were completed and received clearance to departure airport where a safe overweight landing was completed.

The takeoff was a normal event and once we rolled out to our assigned heading around 1800 ft; we had a bang and the aircraft rolled to the right. I quickly gained corrective control of the aircraft and the Captain (PM) announced the engine failure. He [requested priority] and stopped the climb at 2000 ft. Once we established the aircraft heading and received vectors from ATC; we began the QRH and QRC for engine failure; fire; and separation. The Captain was in communication with the Cabin Crew and ATC during the event. Once the engine was shut down and secure we prepared for the visual approach back into XX. Airport fire was standing by and we taxied to the hot break section of the airport for a visual inspection of the brakes by the Fire Crews. Once we got the go-ahead from the Fire Department we communicated with Ground Ops and ATC to be towed back to the departure gate.,B737-700 First Officer reported an engine failure during climb. The flight crew completed the QRH procedure and was provided priority handling to the departure airport where a safe landing was completed.

After takeoff; at approximately 300 ft. to 400 ft.; I noticed the #1 Engine EGT went red and indicated 968 degrees. I incorrectly stated we had an engine overheat because I saw the high EGT. At 1000 ft. after cleaning up the aircraft; I asked the F/O (First Officer) to pull out the QRH for Engine Overheat and as he looked at the index; he realized that it was a QRC item (as was the checklist we should have run: Engine Limit or Surge or Stall). We ran the Engine Overheat QRC and QRH. Everything with the wrong QRC/QRH went as I was expecting with the one exception of it having us retard the thrust lever all the way to idle rather than to the point where the indication went away as I was expecting; however; I clarified with the F/O that that was what it said; and we again failed to trap the error. The red indication went away shortly after reducing the thrust lever. We informed Tower we would be returning to ZZZ; due to a malfunction with our #1 engine. I notified the flight attendants of the situation and that we did not anticipate an evacuation. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them know of the situation and that we were returning to ZZZ. I also requested that they get us a gate. We had requested with ATC slightly extended vectors to Runway XX; in order to accomplish all the Non-normal and Normal Checklists and to set up and brief the approach and landing. We [requested priority handling] with ATC; so that the Crash Fire Rescue would be on hand; in case we had any further engine trouble and due to the fact that we would be landing overweight in a high ambient temperature of 99 degrees F. We decided to perform a 15 Flap landing in case we had to go around and had any further trouble with the #1 Engine; especially due to the high ambient temperature with a fully loaded aircraft. We also elected to use autobrakes 3. The landing was smooth; and we rolled out to Taxiway 1 at Tower's request; so that we could pull off into the de-ice pad for the fire trucks to inspect the aircraft. We ran the brake cooling performance data. We had to allow 30 minutes of cooling before returning to the gate. We coordinated with Crash Fire Rescue to shut down the engines so that they could chock the nose wheel for us to release the parking brake and help with brake cooling. At this point; we debriefed how we handled anything and as we reviewed the QRH again on the ground the F/O noticed that the indications section of the QRH showed the Engine Overheat lights and that that did not match our situation. This is when we realized we should have run the Engine Limit or Surge or Stall QRC and QRH. After the 30 minutes brake cooling; we coordinated to have the chocks removed and restarted the #2 Engine. Crash Fire Rescue followed us taxiing. We ensured Ground Personnel would be aware that #2 Engine would be running instead of the usual #1 Engine until we were stopped at the gate.After selecting the wrong QRC and continuing into the QRH; we should have re-verified the indications shown above the QRH steps. This would have shown us that we were in the wrong checklist. Additionally; I should have queried more than I did when I felt that retarding the thrust lever to idle rather than just until the indication went away. I should have had us re-verify the indications/condition section of the QRH. Lastly; I think consideration should be given to removing these two emergency checklists from the QRC and to only have them in the QRH. This would drive the first actions we take to be verifying the indications prior to following an initial wrong selection that gets us headed down the wrong path. Alternatively; I think adding the indications to the QRC; would help limit this kind of error.,Air carrier Captain reported on departure one of the engines indicated a high Exhaust Gas Temperature. The flight crew retarded power to idle on the engine and returned to the airport for an overweight landing.

Upon the #1 Engine EGT moving into the red; the Captain reduced thrust to idle and completed appropriate checklists. He notified ATC; the Passengers; and Dispatch of the event. He then prepared the aircraft for an overweight landing at ZZZ.  After landing in ZZZ; the Captain observed a 30-minute brake cooling limitation before blocking back in at ZZZ. The Captain then called me and I established a conference call including the Captain; the Chief Pilot; Supervisor; Manager and myself for a debriefing on the event.,Dispatcher reported that a B737 Captain experienced an overheat of the #1 engine during climb . The flight crew returned to the departure airport and made an overweight landing.

We performed the ECAM disengage auto thrust and checked the supplemental. This was very helpful because it gave us more detail on what to expect for possible compressor stalls; otherwise; we wouldn't not even had an idea that this ECAM was very serious because it did not tell us to do anything other than disconnect auto thrust; and possibly said avoid thrust rapid changes; but then on leveling off I tried to move the power levers slowly; as per supplemental. We received compressor stalls; adjusted thrust again and stop compressor stalls. At this time we decided to inform ATC of the situation; [requested priority handling]. We also informed Dispatch. Then; I told the passengers and crew of the situation two different times once on initial decent and again prior to 10000 ft; what to expect and what to see on the ground upon landing. But then as we started a descent and turned to ZZZ the engine #2 stalls continued with every small adjustment of the thrust so I went to idle thrust on #2 engine; but then the EGT went to MAX. We then performed engine stall checklist per QRH and performed engine shut down per QRH and non-routine landing considerations. We went back to ZZZ and landed XXC; stopped on taxiway and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) do an inspection of the aircraft and #2 engine. Received OK to taxi to the gate. Enclosing I have to mention that my First Officer did a fantastic job all the way around. Communication; making suggestions; performing checklists and everything it takes to be a crew of two. The ECAM did not describe chances of compressor stall. I think the biggest thing I could suggest would be somehow changing the ECAM to alert the crew of possible compressor stalls also a little more detail in the supplemental as far as if you're in the air or on the ground would be great.,Air carrier pilots reported during climb the EICAS showed a #2 engine vane fault. The engine began to produce engine stalls with each throttle movement. The crew returned to the departure airport.

Engines were already at idle on descent. Before we could get to the procedure for the Comp Vane; we got Eng 2 Stall followed by Eng 2 Fail. Eng 2 was windmilling at approx 47% N2 causing the switching back and forth of the Gen 2. Screens kept flashing with these changes adding to distraction as we tried to diagnose. Started APU. Followed Eng 2 Fail ECAM. Engine was not restarting and opted to complete engine shutdown procedure as directed by ECAM. Additionally; EGT 2 was higher than expected (approx 570 [degrees]) although never exceeded limits. We opted to leave engine shut down.At first continued on the ZZZZZ profile but once we [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Approach; changed to vectors for Visual (ILS backup) Runway XX at ZZZ. First Officer coordinated descent and vectors while I briefed Flight Attendants and sent message to Dispatch. They were given 8 minutes; did not prepare for evacuation and I explained the engine was shut down. Gave a quick briefing to passengers on engine being shut down; told them to follow FA (Flight Attendant) instructions and that we would plan to go to gate.We briefed the new approach and continued vectors to Runway XX. Flaps full landing with auto brakes low. Uneventful touchdown and taxi. Continued to Gate XX. Debriefed Flight Attendants upon arrival. They did hear unusual noises; and the power switching (lights turning on and off) was alarming to them. Passengers complied with all of their instructions.,Airbus 319 flight crew reported a #2 engine failure while descending to the destination airport.

ECAM directed us to turn off the PTU (Power Transfer Unit) and the green system engine driven pump. The system page showed the green system quantity at zero. We then discussed the landing implications without the green system. A phone patch with Dispatch and Maintenance confirmed the best decision was to land at ZZZ1 due to the longer runway. With no green system; we had to manually lower the gear; would not have left thrust reverser; no nose wheel steering and be on alternate braking. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and coordinated that we would be stopping on the runway. After gravity extending the gear; the approach and landing were uneventful on XXR in ZZZ1. Maintenance and fire/rescue met us on the runway. We shut down and were towed to the gate.,An A320 First Officer reported a loss of hydraulic fluid and diversion to an airport with a longer runway.

After running the appropriate checklist; it was determined that an engine needed to be shut down; and the aircraft needed to be landed at the nearest suitable field. The Air Crew contacted ATC; [priority handling] was declared; and it was determined that ZZZ was the nearest suitable field. The aircraft was recovered single engine to Runway XXR without incident.,Air carrier pilot crew reported a fuel leak while climbing en-route.

After working the immediate response items; we requested a turn back to ZZZ as the [priority] aircraft. Our Green hydraulic system Indicated empty and the gear had to be extended non normally as per the follow ups.We applied the HYD non normal to the landing app for an acceptable landing distance. A quick call was placed to the cabin to share our return plans with a planned stop on the runway for an inspection and to have the emergency equipment on standby in the event situations deteriorated. A radio call to ZZZ Operations / Maintenance which is conveniently a shared frequency to bring them up to speed on our status and return. A couple of miles from the XR LOC we deployed the gear manually so as not to be rushed. All checklists got completed and a safe landing was completed with a stop on the runway for an exterior inspection before heading to the gate.

Everything was going smoothly until we were in the climb around 14;000' MSL. I was Pilot Flying and the autopilot was off; when we felt a vibration and noticed the #2 (right) engine N1 roll back to idle. The N1 roll back was followed by an amber ENG FAIL indication on the EGT gauge. The Captain and I decided to [request priority handling]; run the engine failure QRH procedure and return to ZZZ. We landed back in ZZZ uneventfully. Once we were clear of the runway; we had personnel inspect the engine for damage; which was found to be minimal. We ran brake cooling calculations in the air but ran them on the ground again with updated brake on speed to ensure we were safe to taxi back to the gate. Once brake cooling data told us we could return to gate; we taxied in without issue.,B737 First Officer reported a vibration followed by an engine failure during climb. Crew performed checklist procedures while returning to departure airport for landing.

I recalled that there had been a write-up in the log history for the same issue a few days prior. The corrective action was that the trim chain had been lubed. I asked the FO (First Officer) if he thought the noise was unusual or louder than normal and he agreed. We made an Electronic Log Book entry. Maintenance met us upon arrival and immediately opened the bay and had us cycle the trim both directions. They reported no abnormalities and it sounded normal. It did sound normal to both of us on the ground but we told the mechanics it was definitely louder in flight. We left the plane with them and proceeded to our next flight. I later went back to review the findings and based on the Electronic Log Book; the horizontal stab drum drive chain was determined to be chafing on the control stand bulkhead frame.,Air carrier flight crew reported noise from stab trim drive chain which maintenance determined was caused by chafing on the control stand bulkhead frame.

Just prior to our level off at our cruising altitude of FL320 I noticed an abnormal noise in the #2 engine. In a matter of seconds the noise became multiple very loud bangs characteristic of a compressor stall; while also smelling something like burning rubber. The Captain immediately reduced power and lowered the aircraft's nose. While he did this; I advised center that we were leveling off at FL310 as I wasn't entirely sure if we were a [priority handling] aircraft at this point. The Captain called for the QRC for an engine compressor stall; and while I was looking for the checklist we were receiving a call from our flight attendants. At this point the engine appeared stable at a reduced thrust setting; so I answered the FA (Flight Attendant) call while the Captain advised air traffic control and got us a lower altitude. The flight attendant advised that they had smoke in the cabin; to which I responded we were working on the situation and would get back to them with more information. I informed the captain of the flight attendant's report and we decided to run the smoke and fumes QRH while diverting back to ZZZ. As there was no visible smoke in the flight deck; we both concurred that oxygen masks were not necessary. The Captain continued flying and working the radios while I ran the QRH. Once that was complete; the passengers; dispatch; and flight attendants were all advised we would be returning to ZZZ. Once we landed ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) visually inspected our aircraft for damage and reported that there was none. The captain requested that one or two of the safety vehicles follow us back to the gate; where we parked with no further incident. The casual factor was a maintenance issue with the #2 engine.,B737-800 First Officer reported compressor stall sounds from the #2 engine and the smell of burning rubber and smoke in the cabin when they were about to level off at cruise altitude. Crew ran compressor stall and smoke/fumes checklist prior to returning to departure airport for landing.

Recycling gear was not recommended by Maintenance Control due to the possibility of inducing further damage.Re lamping also not recommended by Maintenance Control due to potential electrical issues.Next course of action was initiating a fly-by to ZZZ Tower to confirm gear status.ZZZ Tower confirms gear down however we had no confirmation on whether it was locked.Fuel on board at this time is now 40;000 lb and the aircraft is now below max landing weight. Captain and Dispatch concurred with plan to burn down another 10000lb-12000lb (45 min) for safety margin and prep cabin for an approach into ZZZ. Partial or gear up landing procedure was briefed.There was inquiry about checklist item for R side brace MSG and selecting all fuel pumps off at pattern altitude.

The Captain was PF (Pilot Flying) and FO (First Officer) was PM (Pilot Monitoring). We were slightly high on base during vectors. PM stated Captain we will need boards and flaps to get down"". PF complied. We intercepted LOC and PM called it out. However; we never captured GS. As RFO I articulated ""we are high; no GS"" this was echoed by RFO2 stating ""you're in ALT"". The PM was also aware and told the Captain ""if we are not going to be stable at 1k; we will need to go around."" PF said ""ok"" and with AP (Autopilot) already off; decreased pitch slightly as an attempted capture GS. At that point no action was taken for several seconds except that slight descent and we were well above GS unable to make a safe landing (4 white PAPI and well above GS). The PM directed a go around around moments later at 1300ft. TOGA was not pushed and no words were spoken by PF. But the aircraft pitched up as Captain flying said something quietly. At this point the PM noticed the PF seemed to be low SA (Situational Awareness) after making callouts for the Captain that he missed. A moment later the FO stated ""I have the aircraft"" and started to execute the go around. This was the right call since we had hardly climbed and there were no commands from the Captain. I began filling in additional missed call outs as well as the FO. No thrust set call was made because TOGA had not been pushed. The FO was now doing double duty essentially. I did not see the thrust ref FMA or magenta reference on n1; so I began to fixate on the throttle position and speed. We got slow and I said ""we are slow; add power."" The FO turned off FDs at some point. A few seconds later RFO 2 said set climb attitude since the aircraft was now at 5NL. Next; we worked as a team to confirm heading and ALT by ATC. I noticed we were off and told FO "" 20 right for heading."" He has his hands full from the non standard go around; but immediately corrected the heading deviation. The Captain wanted to fly but we agreed the FO keep the aircraft and make the landing. At some point TOGA was pushed. The Captain believes he hit it at some point he admitted in debrief. I don't know when; but I believe this is what caused the 5NL attitude because of when we expected the go around and what we had set in the MCP. That is why I believe the FO had to turn off the FDs.Cause: Breakdown in crew communication (captain to FO).Solution: Brief go around procedures.""",Air carrier B777 flight crew reported lack of response from flying pilot on unstable approach resulted in Pilot Monitoring taking control of the aircraft for a go around and subsequent landing.

I was the Flying Pilot of this flight. Climbing through FL210 with autopilot and autothrust on; we experienced a ENG 2 Compressor Vane ECAM. I monitored the aircraft and took ATC communications while the First Officer accomplished the ECAM. I leveled off at FL230 while notifying ATC that we were have an engine issue. We did not [request priority handling] at that point in time. Shortly after this ECAM while the First Officer was going through the ENG2 Compressor Vane ECAM; we received an ENG 2 FAIL ECAM. I subsequently [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center; and told them we needed to return to ZZZ. They responded quickly and gave us a turn back to ZZZ while we maintained FL230. The First Officer and I worked through the ECAMS and checklists associated with the above. As we were completing our checklists; the First Officer called the flight attendants to suspend the cabin service and advise them we were going back to ZZZ. I worked with ATC to give them information they asked for; souls on board; fuel quantity; etc as we progressed back to land. I briefed the flight attendants; told them that no prep of the cabin was needed; and that we should be on the ground in about 20 minutes. I made a PA announcement to the passengers and told them what had happened; what to expect; and that we were returning to ZZZ. ZZZ Approach set us up for a visual landing with ILS backup on [Runway] XX. A successful single engine approach and landing was accomplished. Fire/Rescue equipment followed us upon landing and inspected the aircraft after we cleared the runway. (We were approximately 6000 to 7000 lbs over max landing weight and the temperature was in the mid 90's so I requested they inspect our wheels as the brakes were quite warm.)We were subsequently cleared to taxi to gate with firetrucks in tow. ZZZ Operations gave us our gate assignment and we taxied to complete the flight. After the aircraft was secured at the gate and parking checklist was completed; the First Officer and I took a couple minutes to debrief ourselves before opening the cockpit door. I then went into the cabin to make an announcement to our passengers about what to expect. I was able to coordinate with the gate agents and operations and we then deplaned; the passengers to re-accommodate them. I then debriefed the flight attendants to check on them. After a short time; Company Maintenance arrived at the aircraft. Of note was one of the mechanics that came onboard and made a comment that we really didn't have any engine problem or damage and that We've seen this kind of thing before."" I thought that to be kind of an odd statement with the ECAM screen still showing ENG 2 FAIL.I can't speak for the First Officer; but I felt like he just blew off what had just happened with our aircraft. Enough said about that.""",A320 pilot reported engine failure ECAM message and returned to departure airport.

Ground stop lifted and proceeded to ZZZ. The radar was on the entire flight. Enroute ATC advised we were to expect holding and slow to slowest practical airspeed. Holding issued and Estimated Critical Fuel given. Dispatch advised of situation and fuel via ACRS. During hold ATC was extending Estimated Critical Fuel times. I advised ATC that I was diverting to my alternate based on my bingo fuel calculations (fuel was not critical). Dispatch advised; proceeding to alternate ZZZ2. ATC issued a heading. As we proceeded; we were IMC; in and out of the clouds with haze avoiding radar returns as needed. I was pilot monitoring and was getting set up for the new destination. The visibility suddenly improved and there was a build up In front of us that was not on the radar and we could not see before hand. We had no time to react. We experienced moderate to severe turbulence. Things happened VERY VERY quickly. We heard what I thought was hail and I told the FO (First Officer) to bank right. As we banked right I heard a loud bang and the left forward windshield shattered; and I [notified ATC]. I was given a frequency change and [re-notified ATC] stating that I need to descend to 10;000 FT. We were at FL230. I was concerned that I might loose the windshield and depressurize. We were given 9;000. We proceeded to ZZZ2 and landed without incident. I taxied off the runway and safety vehicles inspected the aircraft and runway. I taxied to the gate and the Passenger deplaned. There were no reported injuries to Passengers or Crew. I communicated with Dispatch and Company safety. He stated that the Director in ZZZ3 was going to call me. We spoke briefly and he requested a picture of the windshield and any other damage that may have occurred. No observed damage noted other than the windshield and picture was sent. Crew tracking wanted the FO and I to ride in car back to ZZZ to over night. The Director arranged for us to stay the night in ZZZ2. We proceed to the hotel. The XA:30 limo was a no show. I was on hold for an extended time with the hotel/transportation desk with no response and no vehicle contact information. I hung up and talked with the duty pilot and said I would get a rideshare to ZZZ4 to finish the trip.Cause: Unobserved build up and hail while in IMC conditions. No time to react when we became visual to avoid build up.Suggestions: As a new CA (Captain) flying with a new FO we were both very consultative on the decisions we were making i.e. weather avoidance and determining bingo fuel. We discussed all things as a crew. I am not sure of how this situation could of been avoided being we were IMC. We were using the tools that we had. It was an unfortunate event with windshield damage. Thankfully no one was injured. I will continue to develop my self as a Captain and caulk this up to a learning experience.,A321 Captain reported encountering moderate to severe turbulence and hail from an unseen/undetected buildup while diverting to an alternate. Left forward cockpit windshield shattered during the encounter. Aircraft landed with no other damage or injuries.

The F/O also noticed that the cabin altitude was 9800 ft. which is not normal. A search for the correct checklist ensued and shortly thereafter the cabin altitude exceeded 10;000 ft. which caused a high cabin altitude warning to annunciate. We donned our 02 masks and established crew communication via the intercom. The cabin altitude uncontrollable checklist was accomplished. I determined that the cabin altitude was uncontrollable based on the observation that both cabin outflow valves were indicating fully closed. I then determined that an expedited descent to 10;000 was required as the next course of action. [Requested priority handling] followed by a request for a descent to 10;000 ft. We were issued a series of step down clearances which resulted in attaining the requested 10;000 in a timely manner. The descent was accomplished using full speed brakes; idle power; and 310 KIAS. I requested holding at the ZZZZZ intersection so as to weigh our options. There was no apparent deficiencies of our aircraft and we had an abundance of fuel. There were no urgencies at this moment. I conferred with Dispatch; Maintenance Control; ATC; and the flight attendants. I made timely PA announcements. It should also be noted that no passenger O2 masks had deployed as we never reached the 14;000 ft. threshold level. Our timely descent precluded that. Prior to reaching 10;000; the IRO was called back from his break and arrived shortly thereafter. He then provided valuable assistance in our planning.While conferring with Maintenance Control via SATCOM; Maintenance Control stated that they desired we would have attempted to manually close the cabin outflow valves. Doing so; would have allowed the valves to close further he stated; possibly allowing the cabin to become controllable again. My own observations indicated the valves to be fully closed. The checklist we used asked a simple question as to whether the cabin was controllable or not.After consultation with Dispatch a decision was made to divert the aircraft back to ZZZ. The trip would be about 2 hours due to the low altitude. We had an abundance of fuel and an aircraft with no apparent defects. The weather at ZZZZ was 1/4 mi. visibility. We would jettison about 34;000 lbs. of fuel in order to be under our maximum landing weight. Exact information regarding the fuel dumping was sent to Dispatch using the text function of ACARS. While returning to ZZZ; I declined most ATC requests for priority handling. I believed that operating in a normal/routine manner was the best course of action. We then began working on low priority issues in regards to passenger comfort and amenities. We landed in ZZZ using autoland with me flying. While deplaning; I spoke with several Maintenance technicians who inspected our aircraft upon arrival. I was shown a picture of one of the external conditioned air inlets. This inlet was stuck in an open position. This would explain a great many things we observed. In my judgment there would be no way way of pressurizing the cabin sufficiently at a typical cruise altitude.I was very pleased with all who assisted us that night.,Air carrier flight crew flying B777 aircraft reported a malfunction with the pressurization system. Returned to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

About one hour and fifteen minutes into the flight; an ECAM CAUTION message Y RSVR LO LVL was displayed on ECAM and we proceeded to take appropriate action as stated in our operational manual. The First Officer stated my aircraft"" and continued to act as the pilot flying; I identified the problem; and executed the appropriate actions (QRC; ECAM actions and QRH follow ups). During the system review portion of the ECAM actions; we noticed that the entire Yellow hydraulic reservoir was empty and; consequently; the system was rendered inoperative.That became an area of concern to us; as the location of the hydraulic fluid became unknown and the potential for further complications was present. Additionally; secondary failures were associated with the loss of this system. ZZZ2 was three hours away; so it was quite evident to me that even though the aircraft did not suffer a controllability impairment; it was not at state that could be prolonged until reaching destination. Once the appropriate actions were completed; we computed the required landing distance for the present weight and reviewed the QRH procedures for overweight landing. I looked for potential diversion airports with runways longer than 8000 feet. There was a long area of severe weather to our left (south of our course) and the first airport that presented a long runway and was clear of weather was ZZZ. Jeep FD pro runway length filter and weather function; used in combination with the aircraft navigation display and onboard weather radar; was a great tool to enhance situational awareness and assist in the development of a plan. Subsequently; I transferred the radios to the First Officer and contacted Dispatch through Satellite phone and we established a three way communication with maintenance. I described the situation to maintenance and my decision was to divert to ZZZ. Maintenance advised the appropriate personnel at ZZZ and Dispatch provided me with weather and NOTAMs needed. A few minutes later a Yellow pump overheat was generated by ECAM and we completed the appropriate actions again.Then; I proceeded to call the Purser and informed her of the situation and the need of a Precautionary Landing. I made a public announcement and informed the passengers of a mechanical discrepancy that required us to land at ZZZ and the presence of safety vehicles upon our arrival.   The First Officer did a great job flying the aircraft; and preparing for arrival at our diversion airport. I resumed the operation of the radios and [advised ATC]; stating the reason for the diversion; souls onboard; fuel in minutes and airport requested. The First Officer and I reviewed the status of the systems affected one more time and discussed the threats present on this flight. I further reviewed the Overweight Landing procedures once again and proceeded to brief the approach.I informed the First Officer that I was going to perform the overweight landing; so I assumed the role of Pilot Flying and complied with the corresponding procedures. The First Officer reminded ATC of our status and the need of a tow track due to our inability to taxi off the runway.Once we landed; I advised the passengers to remain seated and that in just a few moments we were going to be towed to the gate. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was standing by; maintenance and ground personnel communicated with me via inter phone and they towed us to the gate. Once we arrived at the gate; I greeted the passengers and made the corresponding entries into the maintenance logbook.Once the passengers deplaned; I requested the Flight Attendants to have a debrief in which I shared the details of what happened; the reasons for the diversion; the importance of the system affected; and the tasks the we were performing on the Flight Deck. They shared with me what happened in the Cabin and we left to the hotel.I would like to point out that everyone involved in this mechanical diversion did an outstanding job. The First Officer supported me at all times while ATC provided the right information without introducing any additional distractions or workload. The Flight Attendants were calm and prepared the Cabin for a Precautionary Landing. ARFF was standing by at the right time and the right place. Ground personnel and Maintenance were waiting for us and accessed the runway to tow us to the gate expeditiously. The gate agents were standing by; connected the jet-bridge to the aircraft and deplaned the passengers without any delay. Contract Maintenance started to work on the aircraft immediately to open the cargo doors so the passengers' luggage could be accommodated.Finally; Technical support called me to discuss some details of the failure and I was positively impressed by the thorough and conservative approach they were planning on following. In other words; the positive outcome of this situation was the result of great teamwork.Great teamwork helped mitigate the risks associated with the problem encountered above.The cause of this event was maintenance related; so they will have the appropriate information to prevent it from happening in the future.""",A321 Captain reported a hydraulic system malfunction resulting in a diversion to the nearest suitable airport.

I was woken up when I heard flight attendants take your jumpseats"" which appeared to come over the PA into the bunk and the audio from the oxygen mask mic could be heard. I then sensed a descent initiate. A couple of minutes later once the flight attendants were asked to ""check in"" after reaching a safe altitude; I was then called back into the cockpit via the flight deck. Once I entered back into the flight deck I was briefed of the descent that had occurred as a result of a failure of the pressurization system and a CABIN ALT WARNING. I gathered my bearings and saw we were just outside ZZZZ at 9;000ft. We then started devising a plan together for a diversion and confirmed once again with the cabin crew to ensure everyone was okay and there was no visible damage to the aircraft that could've resulted in our issue. My role at this point as the Relief Pilot was to set up the communications via the SATCOM in preparation for the Captain to speak with Dispatch/Maintenance Control; I also monitored the flight path while the FO (First Officer) flew the aircraft. I commenced obtaining weather information via the sources on my ipad. We entered a hold before we made a decision where to divert. As a crew; along with the input from Dispatch and Maintenance Control we agreed that our best course of action was to return to ZZZ. An alternate of ZZZZ was not favorable due to weather. Once we commenced our diversion since we were overweight we then began the discussion regarding fuel dumping which we later coordinated ATC. We recorded the position and shared with our dispatcher. We then confirmed via our FOM diversion guide that we had considered all possible challenges that came with our situation. Upon arrival; Maintenance inspected the aircraft and advised ""Both outflow valves closed; Maintenance confirmed initial findings (found ice in the air hook up; check valve broken and confirmed CABIN ALT WARNING)"".""",B777 air carrier First Officer reported pressurization system failure in cruise flight and returned to departure airport for uneventful landing.

I asked the First Officer (FO) to go to the QRH and look up the procedure for the indication; we followed the QRH procedure and it lead us to shutting down the engine after the indication remained illuminated after closing the affected throttle. We immediately [requested priority handling] and requested a lower altitude and a return to ZZZ as our destination airport was reporting heavy showers and visibility down to 2 miles with a much shorter runway. We secured the engine; notified Dispatcher and let the flight attendants know what was happening with a message. We received radar vectors to ZZZ Runway XXR and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) meet us on taxiway 1 where an external inspection was conducted by ARFF and after we were cleared; we were followed by ARFF to gate without further incident.,B737 crew reported receiving an 'oil filter bypass' warning just after reaching cruise altitude.

After a normal taxi and flaps 15 departure from Runway XC/[Taxiway] 1; we performed a NADP (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure)-1 climb out and initiated our flap retraction sequence at approximately 4;000 ft. MSL. As we retracted the flaps from position 1 to flaps up an EICAS message LE SLAT ASYM"" momentarily displayed; cleared and reappeared as we climbed through 6;000 ft. MSL. First Officer (PF (pilot flying)) continued the climb out to 12;000 ft. MSL maintaining the airspeed of 240 kts. making sure not to overspeed the flaps. I asked First Officer (relief pilot) to pull up the LE SLAT ASYM non-normal checklist. With the aircraft level at 12;000 ft. MSL; we began running the non-normal checklist and asked ZZZ Center for a holding fix to hold as we ran through our checklist. ZZZ Center gave us clearance direct to ZZZ1 VOR to hold. Having completed the non-normal checklist; I contacted Dispatch and requested to speak with Maintenance Control. I advised Maintenance Control we had an LE SLAT ASYM EICAS displayed and we had completed the non-normal checklist and asked if Maintenance Control had any further guidance regarding our situation. Maintenance Control informed us they had no further guidance to resolve the EICAS message which led us to the conclusion that we needed to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. We dismissed Maintenance Control from the phone patch; advised Dispatch that we [request priority handling] and were returning to ZZZ. At this time I asked First Officer (relief pilot) to notify the Flight Attendant; and give her the briefing regarding our [priority handling] and that we were returning to ZZZ. We asked Dispatch to verify our landing distance calculation which matched our calculation stating our landing distance required was 5;000 ft. At this point; we ended our phone patch with Dispatch and I made a PA to the passengers that we had a maintenance situation requiring us to return to ZZZ. We gave ZZZ Center/Approach our request to land Runway XXL (longest runway at ZZZ) and requested emergency equipment be available to the aircraft after landing. We also advised Air Traffic Control that our approach speed was going to be approximately 190 kts. due to our non-normal landing configuration and requested a 20-mile final to Runway XXL. We performed an uneventful flaps 20 approach and landing; clearing Runway XXL at Taxiway 2. We stopped the aircraft on Taxiway 3 and made contact with Crash Fire Rescue (CFR). We asked CFR to inspect our aircraft paying special attention to the brakes due to the 190-kt. touchdown speed. Our brake temperature indications peaked at level 6 and CFR stated the aircraft was in good condition and did not observe any indications of excessive heat from the brakes. We advised ATC we would like to continue our taxi to Gate XXX and CFR advised us they would trail the aircraft to the gate. After parking at XXX we performed the parking checklist and I advised CFR that we were parked and thanked them for their service. We had the main gear chocked; and released the parking brake to aid in the cooling. Upon opening the aircraft door; Maintenance boarded the aircraft where we debriefed them on the leading-edge slat asymmetry event. We wrote up the LE SLAT ASYM EICAS as well as the overweight landing (351;000 lbs.). At this time; I called the Chief Pilot and debriefed the event. I contacted Crew Scheduling who released us from duty.""",Air carrier pilot crew reported a leading edge slat disagree EICAS message during climb-out.

Touchdown and rollout was normal on landing for Runway XXR. Directional control using rudder on the landing roll was normal. I did not apply any brake pressure during the rollout and full reverse thrust was used. We transferred controls right around 80 knots. He began to apply steady braking to slow the aircraft down as we approached high speed turn off Taxiway 1. The Captain turned the aircraft towards Taxiway 1; and as the aircraft was steadily decelerating on the high speed Taxiway; we received an ECAM WHEEL N/W STRG FAULT. The Captain applied rudder pedal deflection to steer the aircraft. The aircraft jerked to the left and right as the Captain tried to steer the aircraft away from the edge of the Taxiway and back towards the centerline of Taxiway 1 using rudder pedals. I thought there may be a loss of braking issue while this was occurring so I quickly asked if he would like me to flip the N/W Steering switch. The aircraft coasted across the Runway hold short line and came to a stop. Brake temperatures and hydraulics appeared normal. The Captain proceeded to notify ATC that we had lost our steering abilities. We completed the ECAM; and ATC took the initiative to roll the trucks to our location and notify the company. The Captain then proceeded to contact the flight attendants to inform them of our situation. I proceeded to contact operations to request the ground crew to tug us to our Gate; XX. We completed the tow-in supplemental procedure and were towed to the Gate without further incident.,A319 First Officer reported an aircraft steering failure while exiting the runway. The Captain steered clear of the runway; remained on the taxiway and notified ATC to coordinate a tug to the gate.

I continued to hand fly airplane and modified profile to set up for return. Elected to remain at flaps one 190 knots. I alert flight attendants to air return and notified the passengers. FO sent a message to dispatch regarding same. We told ATC we wanted long runway and equipment standing by due to loss of normal braking and nosewheel steering. Uneventful landing. We were able to stop with use of reverse mostly then alternate braking below 80 knots.

I pointed this out to the FO (First Officer) (pilot flying); and we continued with normal takeoff procedures. As we approached the bird's position; and the 80-kt. call was not yet made (my attention was focused primarily outside the aircraft); and it did not relocate; as we'd both later discussed was our mutual expectation. Instead; it stayed where it had landed; and only attempted to move as we came within perhaps one or two hundred feet. of it. As we passed its position; we heard and felt a significant impact on the left side; and we elected to abort the takeoff; expecting that damage had likely been done to the engine and/or aircraft at that point. With thousands of feet remaining; we rejected the takeoff by closing the thrust levers; using no reverse; having no autobrake actuation; and nominal/normal braking; and cleared the runway at roughly a midpoint high-speed taxiway; and returned to a gate; to learn that the number one engine had sustained damage.A large bird landing on the runway at or shortly after the time of our receipt of takeoff clearance.I do not recall being trained to consider the presence of non-fixed/mobile obstructions; animate or otherwise; as a reason to decline; cancel; or reject takeoff clearance or a takeoff maneuver; but I do recommend this becoming a training scenario/lesson; as I realize now that simply delaying our takeoff until the trespassing bird could be seen to have evacuated the runway environment would have almost certainly have precluded this incident. I will; from now on; never again attempt a takeoff with any obstruction; living or not; fixed or mobile; within the takeoff flight path.,B737-800 Captain reported a large bird on the runway prior to takeoff.

Just past ZZZZZ; and on course; we were slowing the aircraft and selected flaps 1 on arrival and approaching ZZZZZ1 on the RNAV RWY XX.  We experienced a MASTER CAUTION and HYD Annunciator message.  At that moment we had a Hydraulic B engine driven pump LOW PRESSURE light illuminated on the overhead panel.  We also looked at the lower display unit and saw that our HYD B quantity was at 0; We followed the QRH procedures and turned off the HYD B Engine driven pump.  Moments later we then received a Hyd B ELEC Pump LOW PRESSURE light along with a FLT CONTROL B LOW PRESSURE light.  Knowing that we then had a loss of HYD B system I [requested priority handling].  At that point I referenced the QRH of LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics (the FO was PF).  As events unfolded; we wanted to slow the aircraft and extended flaps 5.  We also put the gear down and selected flaps 15.  At this point we were past ZZZZZ1 and on an approximately 8-10 mile final descending and slowing.  I referenced the LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics and ensured we had ample runway available with the aircraft configuration.  Made a reference to the list of the inoperative items.  And made the determination to land with the runway insight.  I made the determination to continue the approach and land while considering the condition of the aircraft; the terrain of the surrounding airport; and thunderstorms in the proximity of the area and felt our (my) considerations had the greatest margin of safety for safely landing under the conditions.  As part of my considerations; I determined that it was the safest course of action to continue the approach without completing the entire QRH procedure for the LOSS OF SYSTEM B hydraulics.  Our flaps were selected to 15 but because of the loss of system B they only extended to approximately 12-13 degrees.  I determined with reference to the landing data that without the extra 2-3 degrees would still safely allow us ample landing distance.  I took control of the aircraft and landed.  We were met by airport emergency equipment.  We taxied to the gate and deplaned uneventfully.  Cause: We had a loss of hydraulic B system while on arrival into approach.  We had been flying around thunderstorms and into an airport that had terrain considerations.  Because of where the event occurred (as far as where we were on the approach; altitude and airspeed) we had very little time to make decisions.  And my decision was the safest course of action was to continue and land as we were a priority aircraft flying into and airport that was terrain challenged and had thunderstorms in the area.  The weather forecasts were also calling for the weather to move over the field.,B737 air carrier flight crew reported loss of hydraulics on descent. Flight crew landed uneventfully at destination.

Coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance to determine what systems were lost. We were advised not to reset the breaker and the systems we lost included fire warning detection; inter phone; thrust reversers and more overheat and safety systems.Diverted to ZZZ1; Maintenance mentioned that a short could have caused the trip and had fire rescue meet the aircraft to provide fire and overheat warnings as we taxied to the gate.,B737NG Captain reported landing safely following a diversion to an alternate airport after experiencing electrical system anomalies in cruise flight.

Climbout continued as I noticed the left fuel tank quantity rolling back like a countdown timer with the center and right tanks remaining stable. QRH for 'Fuel Imbalance' procedures were followed up to shutting down the left engine. We paused there since we were turning final for Runway XXL at ZZZ and the aircraft was stable and the imbalance was no longer increasing at a rapid rate. After landing we shut down the left engine and allowed ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) to examine the aircraft. ARFF crew verified fuel was not leaking; we single engine taxied to the alley and towed to gate with ARFF supervision. The maintenance crew informed me that they had been called out by the fueling crew for an imbalance condition before the flight however when they arrived the fuel was properly loaded. Cause: Unknown. Post flight review indicates that both engines were being fed by the left fuel tank with all pumps on and cross feed closed. Suggestion: Unknown cause. Early recognition and starting the checklist before getting the fuel imbalance indication maintained the aircraft in a controllable configuration.,During departure climb air carrier flight crew reported the left fuel tank showing a high rate of fuel consumption compared to the right tank. Flight crew elected to return to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

Captain handed the aircraft and radios to the FO (First Officer). I assisted the captain in running the appropriate checklist. We were unable to reset the generators. Upon a conversation with dispatch and maintenance control; we decided to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. We jettisoned fuel and landed with no further incident.,Air carrier pilots reported a dual generator failure on their B-777 aircraft. The APU was started for electric power; ATC provided priority handling and a return to the origin airport was completed.

The Captain (CA) Pilot flying (PF) called their aircraft and radios. The First Officer (FO) (PM) followed the ECAM and checklist. After about 30 seconds another warning alarm sounds. The second time the ECAM displayed pitot fail AOA fail. Simultaneously the airspeed tape and altitude tape showed erroneous information and the standby attitude indicator read zero. The CA turned off the auto pilot and auto throttles and maintained a constant decent. The FO had [requested priority handling] and requested speed and altitude calls from ATC to crosscheck desired performance. Cautions and warnings continued to sound every few minutes with ECAM. This created a very distracting and loud cockpit. As we descended below 14000 ft. it seemed that the instruments became more reliable. The crew continually crosschecked with ATC for confirmation. At about this time the Flight Attendant called the cockpit to inform the crew about an unresponsive passenger. While on vectors ATC reported extreme precipitation on final; they then said the heavy precipitation was gone. While getting on the LOC course the aircraft was still high and was directed by ATC to level off at 3000; and that we would be executing a missed approach. The crew received vectors and landed the aircraft on Runway XXC. Once on the ground the crew taxied to the gate/jet bridge. EMTs came on board and the previously unresponsive passenger awake and responsive once on the ground. Cause: IMC weather conditions; multiple alternates with similar weather as ZZZ icing conditions; multiple systems failures; backup systems failures. Suggestion: I see no actions that could have prevented it. There were a few actions that were omitted due to the extreme situation. Although the crew alerted ATC of the situation the crew forgot to squawk 7700. The crew followed all checklist and procedures and prioritized well.,A319 pilots reported multiple instrument malfunctions during descent. EICAS indicated airspeed; vertical speed; altimeter; angle of attack and pitot-static system malfunctions. After one missed approach a landing was accomplished.

The hydraulic panel revealed the number 1 engine driven hydraulic pump had the LOW PRESSURE light illuminated. I called for and we ran the LOW PRESSURE QRC. The QRC had us switch the pump switch to OFF. We also noticed that system A was down to 22% quantity but the pressure was holding steady at just over 3000psi. We reviewed the LOSS OF SYSTEM A QRC and I determined that since we still had full pressure in the system we were to continue to ZZZ and hold off on that particular checklist. Dispatch and Maintenance Control were notified and [priority was requested]. We received priority handling to ZZZ. I called for configuring the aircraft early and incrementally to be sure we didn't overwhelm the hydraulic system. At this point the quantity reading for system A was fluctuating from roughly 5% to 20%. We successfully configured the aircraft early for landing and landed without further issue.,Air carrier flight crew reported hydraulic system low pressure in cruise. Flight crew landed at destination uneventfully.

On climb-out; around 10;000 ft. the mini-engine display appeared and the oil quantity indicator on the right engine began slowly counting down from around 80. During the oil quantity decline; there were no other indications of an engine event; other than the quantity being highlighted white. No oil pressure light or indication; oil temp or vibration coming from the engine. We continued the climb to our final cruise of 19;000 ft. and reviewed the QRH in preparation for the event that something might happen. The QRH references that the LOW OIL PRESSURE light may or may not be illuminated. During the whole event we did not see the OIL PRESSURE light illuminate. We ran the one step for ENGINE LOW OIL PRESSURE which refers you to the Engine Failure Checklist if the pressure is at or below red line. The pressure was still within limits - green - and had not declined at all from the comparable left engine pressure.The quantity continued to count down and when it got to around 20%; we asked for priority handling to ZZZ1; a shortcut; but we did not declare an emergency. We were given direct ZZZZZ for the RNAV XXL or somewhere thereabouts and we were given a descent. It was around then that the oil quantity indicator reached 0%; still with no other indications. The QRH was on the dashboard; opened up and ready to go. During the initial descent; the oil quantity actually counted back up to 20% and fluctuated up and down. We got the ATIS and landing data for ZZZ1 Runway XXL and briefed a Flaps 40 visual landing. The landing distance available for Flaps 40 was around 1;400 ft. with brakes MAX; wet runway. It was very visual conditions in ZZZ1 with a light wind out of the west and a 5-WET GOOD field report for Runway XXL. We briefed the arrival and approach and ran the Descent and Approach Checklists.  It was around this time that the oil pressure indicator on the mini display rapidly went to zero. The mini display rapidly flashed white; then amber; then red and the engine temperature began to climb on the mini display. Captain called for the Engine Shutdown Checklist and [asked for assistance] with ZZZ1 Approach. The Shutdown Checklist went uneventfully. We were below 10;000 ft. at this time and we may have exceeded the 250-kt. speed limit; but neither of us could recall by what small margin and for how long. We had five hours of fuel onboard - we were tankering 15;000 lb. We briefed the flight attendants and made an announcement to the passengers.By this time; we were on the approach for [Runway] XXL and had ZZZ1 in sight with a single-engine configuration. We ran the landing data for a single-engine landing on [Runway] XXL and noticed that the landing distance available was an acceptable margin with the very favorable VFR conditions. We discussed diverting to ZZZ2 and agreed upon continuing the approach to ZZZ1; with the plan of executing an early missed approach to [Runway] XXL if we were uncomfortable or outside the parameters of a stable approach with the plan of immediately diverting to ZZZ2. The approach; final approach; and landing were normal. We touched down with brakes MAX and exited Runway XXL at our normal exit for this runway. We taxied to the Ramp and had Crash Fire and Rescue inspect the engine for heat or damage - there was none - and continued in to park at the gate.In conclusion; I am proud of the way this event played out. I was comfortable with our plan to continue the approach considering both my experience and Captain's; not only with the 737 but also with flying into ZZZ1. We had discussed all options and eventualities within the short time available and I was satisfied with our Plan B"" as well as a ""C.""This event unfolded very slow but with a very rapid conclusion. It very much reminded me of the loft where we had to decide rapidly between ZZZ3 and ZZZ4 with a fire on board. I think more training with this type of slow engine failure would be helpful.""",B737-800 First Officer reported performing an inflight engine shutdown due to low oil pressure. The flight crew then diverted to an alternate airport.

On the climbout around 6;000 ft. I heard loud bangs and felt the aircraft start to yaw to the right. Once the Captain and I realized it was an engine failure of the #2 Engine; he advised ATC and requested vectors with the intention to return to the departure airport. He ran the QRC; QRH; ran the performance numbers; and we made an uneventful single engine landing/taxi to the gate.,B737-800 flight crew reported engine failure during departure climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed uneventfully.

I (FO/First Officer) was the Pilot Flying. Our cruise altitude was filed 39;000 ft. but we chose to maintain 37;000 ft. for a time in order to avoid a less desirable ride condition at 39;000 ft. for a short time. At 37;000 ft. in visual meteorological conditions; about 30 miles northeast of ZZZ2 airport; the R1 (FO side front) windshield developed a spidering crack engulfing most of the glass. The Captain and I noticed the malfunction and he immediately took control of the aircraft; and I requested a lower altitude with ZZZ Center; which they granted to 25;000 ft. accompanied by a left turn about 40 degrees left due to traffic below us. A short time after we were cleared back enroute now at 25;000 ft. Once established in the descent with the Captain at the controls he asked for the associated QRH. Upon running the QRH we were able to determine with our own physical touch the affected windshield pane was the outer pane. The QRH allowed us to continue to the destination if desired. We also [requested priority handling] with ZZZ ARTCC.With the aircraft under control; the Captain returned aircraft control to me; and they consulted the AOM for guidance on determining how to technically tell which pane of the windshield is broken. This is where some confusion with the guidance came in. After both the Captain and I read over the instructions multiple times our original thought that it was the outer pane stood but the wording on the instructions wasn't exactly clear.We started hearing another unidentified noise coming from the area around my oxygen mask. It sounded like some kind of airflow and both of us could clearly hear it and identify it as something that sounded abnormal. Although no noticeable pressurization abnormalities were occurring at the time; we chose to request a lower altitude in order to mitigate issues if a slow pressurization issue was occurring. ZZZ ARTCC granted us 14;000 ft. We were able to alert the Cabin Crew there was an abnormality. The Captain and I decided to divert to ZZZ3; as it was closer in front of us after running the QRH and AOM guidance. This decision was derived from the only acceptable airports being ZZZ1; over the Mountains and ZZZ4 prior to more mountains. ZZZ3 was decided for distance as well as Company presence and current altitude. We alerted the Passengers of an issue with the aircraft that could affect pressurization so we will be diverting as an abundance of caution. As we prepared for the new approach to ZZZ3 I noticed part of the black seal around the right side of the windshield was detaching and flapping freely in the wind. The Captain conducted the approach and landing as my windshield was obscuring my view and the rest of the approach was uneventful. Airport rescue and firefighting equipment met us upon landing. We taxied to the gate with no further issues noted.  The wording could be modified in terms of how to determine which pane (inner and outer) is affected. The pointed object on the window and moving to determine if the crack moves was confusing to me; and also to the extremely experienced Captain I was flying with.,B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported the cockpit windshield cracked inflight at FL370. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

Went to the QRH referencing fuel flow checklist. Roughly 60 seconds into the checklist the left engine shut down. [We requested ATC assistance] with ZZZ Center; [and] requested [radar vectors] to ZZZ Airport. I followed the fuel flow checklist following all appropriate steps which hyperlinked me to the one engine Inoperative Landing Checklist. Planned landing weight was below MLW and the Non-Normal Configuration Landing Distance table was reviewed for landing data.  Conducted the RNAV XL into ZZZ. We completed some delay vectors to run appropriate checklists and to brief the Flight Attendants (FAs). Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) equipment was standing by on landing; once clear of the runway parking brake was set and I requested the ARFF unit verify we had no fire or smoke; they did advise fuel was leaking from the bottom of the nacelle. ARFF units followed us to the gate as a precaution. We parked and shutdown and deplaned the passengers.  The following numbers were noted during event.FF:  ENG 1= 3.85   ENG 2= 2.4FQ:  Left Tank 4.9  Right Tank 5.6Contacted the Chief Pilot; Maintenance Control with full debrief.

We departed ZZZ on Runway XX. I was the PF (Pilot Flying). While hand flying the aircraft after flap retraction; climbing through approximately 5;000 ft MSL; I noticed the electric stab trim; specifically the nose down function was no longer working. The nose up electric trim was still functioning. I asked my FO (First Officer) if his trim switches were working normally. He operated his electric trim switches and had the same issue. We asked for and received clearance from ATC to level off at 10;000 ft. We informed ATC of our flight control issue and asked for vectors to remain in close proximity to ZZZ2. We ran the QRH checklist for Stabilizer Trim inoperative. Upon completion of the checklist; we decided to divert to ZZZ2 due to the longer runways available for landing at flaps 15; as required by the checklist. We informed ATC of our decision to divert to ZZZ2; and [requested priority handling]. With the autopilot unavailable; I flew the remainder of the flight using manual trim on the trim wheel. We accomplished the non-routine landing considerations checklist; relayed our decision to Dispatch; informed the Flight Attendants and passengers of our need to land at ZZZ2; performed a landing assessment; and the before landing checklist. We flew a normal ILS approach and landed safely at ZZZ2 on Runway XYL. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) met us on the high speed taxiway after we exited the runway and inspected the aircraft. After their inspection; finding no signs of damage or distress; they followed us to the gate.

After rotation; the pilot flying (FO) called for landing gear up. The landing gear was raised immediately; and within 2-3 seconds; the tower called to inform us that we were trailing a significant amount of smoke from what appeared to be one of the engines (We later learned that it was actually hydraulic fluid from the right landing gear well when a line separated; and it completely depleted the green hydraulic system in a short amount of time).  At that same time there was a noticeable load rumbling.  We were approaching 3000 feet and the CA (Captain) asked Tower to level off. Almost immediately; we begin getting ECAMS. The first one was HYD green reservoir low level. Then almost immediately L/G doors not closed with associated warnings and other associated warnings about gear; spoilers; airspeeds; etc.  After reviewing the QRC and determining that this condition was not an immediate action or ECAM exception.  the CA assigned the me to continue flying duties and I directed ECAM actions.  I informed the Tower that we would need to return immediately and the CA set up the MCDU (Multipurpose Control Display Unit) for an immediate return with ZZZ as the new destination; I configured the box for an approach to runway XXR at ZZZ. Tower switched us over to departure for coordination.  The CA [requested priority handling] with Departure and requested equipment meet us upon landing.  Departure allowed us to fly a long downwind with speed at our discretion while we analyzed and addressed our situation and took appropriate actions.The CA commenced the ECAM instructions and turned off the green hydraulic pump then the PTU (Power Transfer Unit); and other actions per the ECAM. We received vectors back to runway XXR.  We had a jump-seater who was a new hire Pilot who had just finished OE (Operating Experience) and had considerable Airbus experience. He assisted us by performing a landing assessment and raising our attention to details on the ECAM; He was actually very helpful. We all remained calm and completed configuring and discussed the systems we had lost including spoilers 1 and 5; reverse on number one engine; normal brakes ( no Anti-skid); auto braking; and components on the green hydraulic system. We reviewed all the systems Lost and the status pages; then commenced with descent checklist; and before Landing Checklist configuring with full flaps. FO flew a normal approach and reported the controls felt a bit mushy"". Weather was not a factor with light winds. The FO landed in the normal landing zone initiated reverse with the one engine reverser; and immediately began breaking. We cleared the runway at taxi way 1 and were met by the emergency responders. Parking brake was set and after the APU was started; we shut engines down and asked for the fire chief to visually evaluate our condition. He reported hydraulic fluid was leaking and puddling below the aircraft but mostly out of the right landing gear.  There was no smoke or indication of imminent fire so we allowed the fire department to more thoroughly assess and decided to get towed back into the gate. We were approximately 3000 pounds over max landing weight (Maintenance control was notified and a report submitted for overweight landing) and we did a quick review of the overweight Landing QRH to include go around considerations.  Once maintenance arrived at the airplane with a tug we retrieved the landing gear locking devices and nose gear pin; and dropped them out of the flight deck window; avoiding contact with the aircraft. They secured all the landing gear and commence to tow us back to gate. We took a different plane to ZZZ1 without incident.Catastrophic failure of the hydraulic line/joint.A catastrophic hydraulic line/joint failure that the crew had no way to know it was going to occur.""",Air carrier flight crew reported hydraulic system failure during departure climb.

We ran the QRH Checklist Transfer Bus Off. As we were progressing through the checklist; the #1 Transfer Bus Off light was becoming more frequent and more persistent. In accordance with QRH; we confirmed we were in operational limits to start and use the APU for electrical. The limit is 41;000ft. and we were at 39;000ft. We started the APU and put the #1 bus on the running APU. This worked for a number of minutes; and we completed the checklist; notified Dispatch and in accordance with QRH; planned to continue to ZZZ1. The APU accomplished an auto-shutdown; and the provided power fell offline. In accordance with 737AOM; APU limitations; we attempted to start the APU again. It stayed on for about two minutes; then auto-shutdown again. We returned to the QRH and followed the APU is not available branch. This directed us to plan to land at the nearest suitable airport. At this point in the flight; the nearest suitable airport in terms of distance; time; Maintenance; and Passenger care was assessed to be ZZZ2. A divert to ZZZ2 was conducted. Looking back; I probably should have gone ahead and [requested priority handling]. No special handling was required; but had the situation turned for the worse; it would have been good to have that. If I'm solving problems with the QRH; serious consideration should be given to [requesting priority handling]. Also; to prevent landing overweight at our nearest suitable airfield; we accomplished a turn back to final to be burn a few hundred pounds of gas to be within aircraft weight limits. Consideration should have been given to accepting the slight overweight landing and follow-on inspection; in order to expedite landing. At the time; I was thinking not to further complicate an already complex situation.,Air carrier flight crew flying 737 aircraft reported electrical system malfunction inflight.

Soon after the level off we heard a loud bang that sounded similar to bird strike or something large being dropped in the galley. At about the same time ATC cleared us to a higher altitude. I set the altitude in the Mode Control Panel and the First Officer (FO) pulled for open climb; as soon as the power started to increase we heard and felt a rapid bang. We both realized it was a compressor stall and quickly received an ECAM warning. I immediately set 10;000 ft. back in the MCP and the FO decreased power and leveled back at 10;000 feet. As soon as the FO decreased power the compressor stall ceased; and the ECAM vanished. I [requested priority] with ATC; and then handed the radios over to the FO. I ran the applicable checklist; completed the brief with the Flight Attendants (F/As); notified Dispatch; and made a PA to the passengers. First Officer had done an excellent job flying the aircraft and communicating with ATC while I doing the above. We requested landing data at ZZZ briefed up the plan and returned uneventfully to ZZZ.,Air carrier flight crew reported #1 engine compressor stalled during initial departure climb.

It was a normal takeoff until after the gear was retracted. A few hundred feet before thrust reduction/acceleration height we experienced 3 loud bangs and subsequent vibration from the left engine. I looked over to the upper display and saw the number 1 engine EGT was red. We both simultaneously said  number one engine failure"". We then experienced three more bangs from the left engine. No ECAMs were present. I reduced the power on the left engine and the stall stopped. We [requested priority handling] with Tower and requested a runway heading track. We finished the climb and cleanup to 10;000 ft. and started to evaluate the problem. Since the stall stopped and the EGT was back to a normal temp we decided to leave the engine running at idle. We were vectored to Runway XXL and made an uneventful landing. ARFF investigated our left engine and said it seemed to be OK. It was a normal taxi to the gate and shutdown.""",A320 Captain reported an engine had several compressor stalls during takeoff at 400 feet AGL.

The Captain (PF) took control of the radios in addition to the aircraft. He advised Air Traffic Control that we needed to level off to run a checklist. I (PM) ran the Landing Gear Fails To Retract non-normal checklist which led us to the (NG) Gear Disagree non-normal checklist. That led us to open and close the manual gear extension access door. Upon doing that it was noted that the door was not completely flush with the floor which; we believed; indicated it was slightly ajar at the time of attempted gear retraction. After opening and closing the manual gear extension access door; as directed by the checklist; and moving the landing gear lever to DN; then UP we showed the red nose gear Landing Gear Indicator Light illuminated. The checklist then led us to Flight with gear down increases fuel consumption and decreases climb performance.'The Captain and I agreed we did not have the fuel to continue the flight to ZZZ1 and the best option was to return to ZZZ. We moved the landing gear lever to DN and received all green Landing Gear Indicator Lights. If we were to immediately return to ZZZ we would have to accomplish an overweight landing. Since the Landing Gear Indicator Lights were illuminating all green and nothing else was of urgency; we decided to hold and burn enough fuel to be within landing weight limits. We advised air traffic control of the updated situation and held until we were within landing weight limits. Once we were within landing weight limits we returned to ZZZ for a normal landing and taxi to the gate. Crash; Fire; Rescue trucks were dispatched and followed us into the gate as a precaution. The Dispatcher; Air Traffic Control; flight attendants; and passengers were updated multiple times; as necessary.""",B737 flight crew reported the landing gear failed to fully retract during departure.

Approximately 1:30 into the flight we had In flight set up for a lav break. During the break; with the First Officer out of the cockpit; an ENG 1 EPR MODE FAULT posted on the ECAM. Both engines were in the rated mode. I complied with the ECAM actions. The First Officer returned to the cockpit and I briefed him on the failure. During this discussion of the ENG 1 EPR MODE Fault a ENG 1 FAIL ECAM posted. We complied with the ECAM actions and the engine appeared to relight. Very shortly; it again showed ENG 1 FAIL. After seeing this ENG 1 FAIL a second time the decision was made to not attempt a relight. We complied with the ECAM actions; followed by the QRH for an ENG 1 FAIL. ATC was notified and [assistance was requested]. We discussed our options for a divert and decided ZZZ was our best choice. I obtained weather and NOTAMs for ZZZ. A call was made to In flight to inform them of our engine shutdown and that we would be diverting to ZZZ. I informed them that this would be a normal landing in ZZZ. I then informed our customers of the diversion due to an in flight shutdown of our left engine. I informed the customers that this would be a normal landing and we would have more information to give them at the gate. I then made a SAT call to dispatch and informed dispatch of our engine failure and our diversion to ZZZ. Dispatch advised us that they would advise ZZZ operations of our diversion. Once our briefings had been completed; we informed ATC we were ready for the approach. A normal landing was made and we taxied to gate. Upon arrival I spoke to the customers from the front of the cabin to inform them we would be staying on the plane for approximately 35-45 minutes while we waited for our personnel to arrive.""",A321 Captain reported safely diverting to an alternate airport after experiencing #1 engine failure.

Before; we could call flight deck; they already called to alert us and to ask if we were alright. In the moment; I started to become light headed and continued out for final compliance. The DH (Dead Head) pilots let us know we needed to put masks on for protection from the scent and advised us it was really bad and unsafe. Shortly after; I took my jump seat for landing. Once we landed; let the crew and pilots know how I was feeling. After we deplaned; I still felt light headed and my throat started to burn. I then decided to take a walk to see if I would feel better during the security check. Once I returned; I felt extremely hot and removed part of my clothing and the crew provided ice packs to cool down all while they also were not in the best conditions and didn't feel well. The pilots including DHs made the decision to call medical services on our behalf's because they saw how bad we all looked. While maintenance did an initial test; he told us he did smell what we experience. After several test; they continued to smell it; and concluded that the toxic fumes were indeed unsafe and advised the flight deck not to operate and took it out of service and ferried to ZZZ. I continued to follow the appropriate steps and spoke to medical services and shared my symptoms. They told me my symptoms were minor and to drink lots of fluids; take pain medication and to get fresh air. They recorded that I was not fit to fly. Also I was unsure what that meant; I proceeded to get direction from a duty lead and she advised us that we needed to be seen by a doctor. I was finally seen by a doctor that made sure I was fit to fly after several hours.Weeks later; my crew and I are being bullied and intimidated by our company. We have been reprimanded and penalized for reporting this event.,Air carrier flight attendants reported a fume event during initial descent in which the flight crew and passengers experienced physiological symptoms. Upon arrival the aircraft was removed from service and after an extensive delay the flight attendants were attended by a medical doctor.

We were unable to switch frequencies and our ACARS was inop with the VHF-3 screen also blank and constant switching from Data to Voice trying to connect. Radio 1 was tuned to ATC and Radio 2 to Guard. ZZZ Center was very helpful and set up a hold for us to work the issue. ZZZ was able to contact the Company and rely our plan to divert to ZZZ which they concurred. ZZZ was VFR and we were below max weight. Due to the nature of the problem we switched PM (Pilot Monitoring) and PF (Pilot Fying) duties and I landed the aircraft. We checked the Flight Manual and there was no procedure and we reviewed the FOM diversion section. We discussed multiple scenarios and CRM was very helpful to come up with our best solution. We ran through the briefing with the FAs and the passengers were briefed on our diversion. We used Guard for the ATC handoffs through descent which worked out perfectly. Hats off to ATC. Approach and landing was uneventful and ZZZ Maintence did their best to try and fix the jet.,Air carrier flight crew reported radio systems malfunctioned after a liquid spill on center console.

Right side FO (First Officer) sliding window had cracked; but only the outer panel. Crack was due to a failed window heating element; probably an electrical short. Window overheat light illuminated. I instructed the FO to put on shoulder straps and tighten. Transfer bus flickered with IDG 2 online as well. Checklists for window overheat light and transfer bus flickering were run uneventful. We prepared and briefed actions in the event of window failure; loss of pressure; descent. Flight attendants were briefed as well. No emergency was declared. We were already close to top of descent anyway. Descent; approach; and landing were uneventful. Following the flight; I called Chief Pilot; who advised nothing more could have been done; and no need for further documentation besides writeup.,B737 Captain reported cracking of the FO's cockpit window at cruise altitude.

Initially; dispatch told us to head to ZZZ1 about 15 minutes later they contacted us and said that the runway was wet in ZZZ1 and to proceed back to ZZZ. We [requested priority handling]. We dumped fuel to get down to landing wait. The fuel dump took 20 minutes. It was started at XA33 Zulu and finished at XA53 Zulu ATC advised us when to start the dump so we won't be over a populated area. During all this vectoring; the First Officer was the flying pilot and he had to hand fly because the autopilot was inoperable . VNAV stopped working when we reached cruise altitude. ATC gave us a 10 mile final to the ILS XX ZZZ.

I immediately disengaged the auto throttle and retarded the number 2 throttle to keep EGT from rising higher.  The throttle was near idle at this point with acceptable EGT; so I tried advancing the throttle.  Upon throttle advancement; the engine shuttered and vibrated. I immediately pulled the throttle to idle which erased the shuttering and vibration.  We accomplished the appropriate checklist while [requesting priority handling].The engine was at idle power with no vibration so we decided to leave it running.  All other engine indications were fairly normal except the oil temperature was higher than usual.  We diverted into ZZZ.  After clearing the runway; we shut the engine down.  After stopping on the taxiway; the fire trucks inspected the engine and advised us of a small fuel fire in the bottom of the engine.  They promptly extinguished it.  Mechanics were called to inspect the engine.  After the inspection; we were cleared to taxi to the gate.,Air carrier flight crew reported during cruise the number 2 engine vibrated with an increase in EGT.

Told them if braking action was less than good in ZZZ; I would go to my alternate. Level FL 370- Eng 2 hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. Followed QRH & shut off eng driven 2 B pump.  Within a short time; we got an ELEC 1 Low B pressure light and Flt Cntrl B Low Pressure light with ZERO B qty. Completed QRH for loss of B system. We were in an area with very large weather system that gave us NO  nearest suitable"" divert runways (all less than cat 1 with gusty winds). Called dispatch and discussed divert/ runway options. We both agreed going to ZZZ1 was best weather option/ divert option. Subsequently got Eng 1 low pressure light (A side).  I knew the PTU kicks in with B fluid doing the work but did not expect ENG 1 A low pressure light. Had good  A side % and pressure; so chose not to shut off that pump (as one might do as QRH checklist has for low pressure light) and risk total A & B hydraulic failure. After 10 mins; Eng 1 low pressure light went out and qty slowly decreased to 80% with good pressure.Landed ZZZ1 using stby hyd to lower flaps/ slats. ARFF checked for leaks and followed us back to gate after giving all safe.Jet had numerous previous reverser write-ups  that could have been hydraulic b problems in hindsight.Recommendations: There needs to be a NOTE in the LOSS OF SYSTEM  B  procedure in the QRH that says if you loose complete B HYDRAULICS; the A side uses its fluid to balance out the system and you will get an A side low pressure light that comes on for 5-10 mins. Otherwise in similar situation; crews will shut off perfectly good pump on A side.""",B737-800 flight crew reported a low hydraulic pressure indication during cruise.

With landing gear down; Flaps 25 and engine anti-ice on; the Flaps 15 Speed bug was in the Yellow band and the Flaps 40 vREF was in the red band/stick shaker. We elected to go around at 1;000 ft. and requested vectors while we evaluating the situation. We resubmitted our performance data (including obtaining new weather). The landing data that came back looked correct; and was the same as the original data obtained. Unsure if we would encounter the same anomalies with the speed tapes again; and fuel at 5.6; we opted to divert to ZZZ1 for the longer runways. We chose to land Flaps 15 in order to keep the speeds above the red band. When we obtained performance data Flaps 15 for XYC at ZZZ1; the performance data generated speed was 146; while the FMC generated speed was 135. We chose the faster speed for landing. Once fully configured for Flaps 15 landing; the Flaps 15 vREF Speed was two knots above the yellow band and 17 knots above the red band. Captain became Pilot Flying for the landing and we elected to increase the speed slightly more to not land in the yellow band.

I elected to reject the takeoff. Reject was initiated at about 80 KIAS. Below 85 KIAS as the rejected takeoff (RTO) did NOT engage. Tower was advised of the reject. The First Officer (FO) made a PA to ""remain seated"". We exited the runway I checked the doors page and the gear page and accomplished the related checklists and elected to return to the gate. Upon inspection Maintenance discovered that a large ADP bleed line (~5"" in diameter) had ruptured in the wheel well with a section approximately 14"" long mostly gone. Further investigation revealed that the rupture had sent shrapnel all over within the wheel well and the aircraft was removed from service to survey any secondary damage that may have occurred from the shrapnel. Passengers seated in the area reported hearing the bang. We heard nothing in the cockpit. During our debriefing we reviewed the low speed abort criteria and noted that a bleed loss body was not on the list specifically; but more generally under ""system failure."" Given the Mechanics description of the shrapnel we were left wondering what secondary failures might have been caused by the shrapnel; if any; had we taken the flight airborne. We were not sure what wires and lines run through the area. We did check the air synoptic and noted that the system had performed the automatic isolation as would be expected; thus after the rupture; bleed air was likely not being injected into the area. Perhaps the risk of secondary damage has been assessed; but not being aware of that; at this point I think that perhaps it should be considered to add bleed loss body to the low speed abort item list. As an aside; For XX+ years of my piloting career I have been trained to call out ""abort."" Being aware of that; since we changed to ""reject;"" I have briefed that ""in the heat of the moment; I am not sure if I will call out reject or abort."" It was a valuable briefing; as I called out ""Abort."" It was hard to unlearn decades of training. I knew as soon as I said it that it was the wrong call out; but my FO know what my decision was and performed perfectly. Also; knowing that the Reject checklist primarily focuses on engine failure/fire; after clearing the runway I called for the bleed loss checklist that was displayed as I was concerned about having hot bleed air ducting into areas it should not and the potential for a fire or related damage. Though we accomplished all of the items on the reject checklist; we realized during our debrief that we had failed to actually run the reject checklist. All of our training for rejects is either to not reject; or for an engine failure/fire. This did not fit into those 2 training events; and yet there were other considerations; hot bleed air leak; secondary damage. As we focused on assessing the potential impact of hot bleed air we forgot to actually run the reject checklist. As this was a low speed reject; without RTO (not as violent as we train in the sim) and an anomaly I have never had; either in the sim or on the line; we were out of the normal sequence where we have been trained to run the reject checklist. When we debriefed this; we reviewed the reject checklist and had in fact accomplished everything on it. I would suggest that training incorporate something like this event for reject training.I had never considered the potential for an explosive bleed line rupture that could cause secondary damage. Though the Maintenance Team did not know the extent of any secondary damage resulting from the shrapnel the potential further reinforced the correctness of my decision to reject the takeoff.""",B777 flight crew received a 'Bleed Loss Body' EICAS message on take-off roll.

As we were about 90NM west of ZZZ2 and about 2:40 into the flight we received an ECAM ANTI ICE STBY PITOT FAULT"". At the time I was the PF (Pilot flying) and following SOP the CA (Captain) remained the PM to resolve the ECAM. With ECAM complete and screens normal the flight continued normally; and I needed a bio break; so I went to the LAV. As I was about to reenter the flight deck; I could hear several chimes. Once I was back in my seat the CA informed me of the situation and I let the Purser know she could go back in the cabin. The CA was hand flying the plane as we lost all automation. He elected to remain PF and I stayed the PM. Using proper CRM and SOP I followed the ECAM prompt. The CA also had a deadheading CA join us in the flight deck who helped us trying to find more information in the QRH as well as augment our resources and CRM capabilities to handle the non-normal situation.Once the ECAM were complete and screens were normal I went to find the ""L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT"" non-normal in the FM (Flight Manual) and the condition paragraph confirmed loss of AP (Autopilot); A/THR and FAC consistent with the complete loss of automation. After the CA [requested priority handling] and as directed; I followed our SOP descent procedure to set up for ILS XXL in ZZZ2 since we wanted to use the longest runway available. By the time we turned around to ZZZ2 we were about 120 NM West and established on vectors and descent for the approach and upon the CA's request I also made a brief announcement to the passenger that following degraded instrumentation and navigation capabilities we were diverting to ZZZ2 for precaution and safety; and we would be on the ground in about 20 minutes. Once the descent procedure was complete and I did the arrival briefing for the CA; we were vectored for the approach and the CA flew in IMC from FL200 to 2;300 ft AGL with raw data only. As we went VMC about 3NM prior to ZZZZZ on ILS XXL we called the runway in sight and approach control cleared us for the visual XXL. The CA met all our stabilized approach criteria the descent; approach and landing were accomplished uneventfully and safely. Once we parked at the gate; we were met by the maintenance crew; and we individually and collectively gave them a narration of the incident. Then the ZZZ Assistant Chief met us and once the CA and I were able to debrief we received a fitness for duty assessment questionnaire to determine we were no longer fit for duty. The CA and I had a complete and extensive debrief afterwards and the CA was extremely thorough to explain that the IOE and Line Check couldn't be completed which I already knew since the CA briefed situations that would require to discontinue the Line Check. The CA made further arrangements so I can be quickly rescheduled to complete IOE.""",A319 flight crew reported loss of auto flight systems in cruise. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

EGT and oil pressure also decreased noticeably. The engine vibration on the number two engine increased to approximately 2.0. The Captain performed immediate action items for engine stall; we ran the QRC and QRH checklist; which resulted in engine indications stabilizing. After contacting Maintenance Control and Dispatch and agreeing to proceed to destination; we experienced approximately one hour of uneventful flight. At that point; air traffic control directed us to descend for traffic. During that descent; the vibrations and abnormal engine indications recurred and the decision was made to [request priority handling] and divert to ZZZ. During the descent and approach; the N1 on number two rolled back considerably; but we were able to execute a relatively uneventful approach and landing.,B737 flight crew reported engine malfunction in cruise flight. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

The aircraft started skidding so brakes were then released and modulated for a safe turn off taxiway 2. ATC instructed us to turn off taxiway 3 instead; and with traffic on short final; I applied power to expedite. Approaching Taxiway 3; braking was again modulated as braking action was good/fair. I made the turn at approximately 9-10 kts but had to slow further as the nose wheel was losing traction. As we rolled on facing towards another aircraft holding short of Runway XYL at Taxiway 3; I applied braking and nothing happened. I increased brake pressure to no avail. It was apparent at this time that we were sliding. My First Officer (FO) also stood on the brakes and at this time I applied reverse thrust and turned the tiller to the left to attempt to arrest the sliding. It appeared and impact was imminent. My FO acted quickly and advised the preceding aircraft to move which caused tower to tell them to expedite and the fast actions of that Captain; as well as my FO and myself prevented a collision.  The braking action on all taxiways north of taxiway 1 were poor/NIL. There were small burns of snow and patches of ice on all ramps and taxiways. It made for a very unsafe situation.My FO was an amazing support. He acted quickly and calmly; assisting me in regaining control of the aircraft. The rest of the taxi was uneventful and we taxied very slow and utilized both engines to get to the gate safely.,B737 flight crew reported almost colliding with an aircraft on a taxiway in front of them when exiting the runway due to breaking ineffectiveness issues.  Crew was attempting to accommodate ATC instructions to exit further down the runway that placed them in an area where the taxiways were more contaminated resulting in loss of control of the aircraft.

It was a normal takeoff. After 400 to 500 ft. AGL; we started our right turn to 025 degrees as per the departure procedures are required. During the turn; we were told to contact Departure. As I contacted Departure; they gave us a right turn direct to our next fix. Captain said that the plane wasn't flying right and said we are leveling off at 5000 ft. and remaining on current heading. He then told me to [request priority handling with ATC] and a return to field. He told me that the controls were snapping fully to the right and it was very hard to return the aileron position back to neutral. He then stated that banking the controls to the left was normal but banking it back to the right would snap the ailerons fully to the right again. We told Departure that we could only make left-hand turns and requested to return to the field for Runway XXC.We then continued to shallowly bank the plane to the left to avoid large control inputs that would cause snapping of the ailerons. Captain mentioned that he was holding the controls with extreme force. As he was flying; I set the plane up for the ILS XXC. I proceeded to look for a flight control QRH regarding the ailerons. I then gave the FAs (Flight Attendant) a call to let them know the situation and that we are landing in about 10 minutes. I then made a PA to the passengers that we had an indication that we needed to return to the airport. We lined up with [Runway] XXC and the Captain noticed as I extended flaps; he felt binding and snapping of the controls. We had an overweight landing with a smooth touchdown about 200 FPM. As the airplane slowed to around 10l kt.; we both noticed the airplane wanting to veer to the right. The Captain applied pressure to correct for it. We exited the runway and taxied safely to the gate.Flight control issues with right deflections. This was the third flight with this issue. Maintenance needs to do a thorough inspection on the aircraft and test fly to make sure it is good for operation.,B737 First Officer reported the aircraft was restricted to only making left turns due to a malfunction with the flight controls to the right. The flight crew performed an air turnback and as the aircraft slowed down after touchdown; the aircraft wanted to veer to the right. The First Officer stated that this was the third flight with this issue.

The Captain called Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss issue and options.  Upon conclusion of this discussion; it was determined the aircraft should return to ZZZ versus continuing to ZZZZ where parts and maintenance personnel limited. Initially notified ATC followed by a request for priority handling once the center tank was exhausted as wing tank quantity in left wing possibly inaccurate.  Aircraft landed without incident and taxied to gate.Factors that played a role and could negate future issues like this would be more frequently monitoring fuel on climb out.  This helps to verify balance remains as desired and if it deviates allows for more opportunity to disseminate root cause. Check of fuel balance at transition level on climb out aids in recognizing an issue like more quickly.,B737-800 First Officer reported a fuel imbalance indication in the left wing. Crew elected to return to departure airport for a normal landing.

CA PF (Captain Pilot Flying); less than 300 hours in type. FO PM (First Officer Pilot Monitoring); less than 100 hours at this carrier. XXX souls on board. ZZZ RWY XXR. Flaps 5 takeoff. 26K thrust. Assumed temp 39C. 150;900 lbs. ZZZZZ SID. Night. Thin cloud layer at 5000 feet. Unrestricted visibility. This was a severe flight control malfunction. What follows is my best recollection of the event.     ZZZ Tower cleared us for takeoff on RWY XXR. During initial climb; at 500 feet AGL; I began a hand flown right hand turn in accordance with the ZZZZZ Departure. As I deflected the yoke to the right; it snapped forcefully right; and I experienced an extreme; uncommanded roll rate. I was struggling with both hands to stop the yoke from banking us beyond 30 degrees. The yoke was still commanding a greater roll rate. Startle factor was tremendous. I could not verbalize any words to the FO (PM). There were no master cautions; no master warnings; and no annunciator lights. Then suddenly the yoke became very light. As I moved the yoke back toward center; the extreme uncommanded roll rate kicked in to the left. I was experiencing severe longitudinal instability; and I was completely task saturated. With the instability; it was a struggle just to hold the wings level. I started making rapid commands to the FO: Bug Up Bug!"" ""Bug 200!"" ""Bug our speed!"" ZZZ Departure then told us something about turning right to a fix; and contacting center. I told the FO: ""No; advise ATC; flight control malfunction; present heading; 5000 feet.""While climbing on the 025 heading; I continued to give left and right yoke inputs to help with troubleshooting. Somewhere between 3000 ft and 5000 ft MSL I determined I could deflect the yoke left to make a left turn and the aircraft felt normal. However; when I moved the yoke back toward center; or if I had any yoke inputs right of center; it felt like my right aileron was going straight to the full up position. Wings level felt like I was trying to balance the roll axis on a needle point. Continual yoke inputs were required to keep the wings level. What was wrong? Aileron Jam? No; there isn't any binding. Hydraulics? No; I would have an annunciator light. Bad PCU? No; the good PCU would overpower the faulty one. Feel and centering mechanism? No; left turns feel normal. I wanted the aircraft on the ground ASAP because I didn't know how much longer we could maintain positive aircraft control; any further deterioration would likely be catastrophic. While on the 025 heading and 5000 feet; ZZZ assigned a right hand turn to some heading and I told the FO ""No; we can only make wide left turns."" He informed ZZZ accordingly. ZZZ assigned us a left turn to heading of 270. I spun the bank angle selector to 10 degrees and began a shallow banked left hand turn. As I rollout; on heading 270; the yoke tries to overpower me again; but I anticipate it; and manage to level the wings. Nothing is improving; but it also isn't getting worse. I'm adapting; anticipating; learning how to manage this longitudinal instability and the uncommanded roll rates. On crosswind; the FO asked me if I would like him to brief the flight attendants. This question helped bring me solidly back into focus. ""Yes; tell the FAs we are returning to ZZZ; Precautionary Landing; 10 mins."" Why precautionary? I still had normal control of my vertical axis and lateral axis. Winds 350. Little aileron needed; if any; so I can keep firm pressure on the yoke; maintain positive control; and complete a safe landing. Then the FO asked me if I wanted him to talk to the passengers. ""Yes; tell them shortly after takeoff we had a small indication up front so we are returning to ZZZ to let our maintenance team look at the aircraft. We'll provide more information on the ground."" ZZZ then gave us a turn to heading 180. I share with the FO what I'm experiencing; and that I may need his help to give me more left aileron input. I asked him to notify dispatchand to include ""aileron malfunction"" in the text. Next; I ask the FO to look through the QRH for anything flight control and aileron related. We couldn't find anything that fit our situation. Then I have the FO complete the After Takeoff Checklist; but keep the Flaps at 5; followed by the Descent Checklist. The FO asks if I wanted him to set up and brief the approach. ""Yes."" Then I told him we will do Flaps 30; Autobrake 3; and to run the Before Landing Checklist. ZZZ is trying to give us a base turn. I want more distance so I have room to make a 10 degree banked turn; and to gently correct an overshoot. The FO relays to ZZZ that we want a 20 mile final. I overshoot base to final a little so we are on approximately a 340 heading to join. ZZZ asks if we can turn right at all? ""No."" Controller says that is okay; that he will just give us a big left hand turn so we can rejoin. I tell the FO; ""No; tell him we are joining from here. We will make it work."" Why? It is going to take me 6-9 minutes to make a huge left turn and I don't know how much time we have before our problem gets worse. The priority is still to get on the ground ASAP. I hit the DATA button; see 4000 ft by the fix were pointing toward; and start making commands. ""Bug 180…Flaps 10…Set 4000 feet…vertical speed down 1000 fpm…arm Approach Mode."" When he selected Flaps 10; the yoke started pulling left and right while the flaps were in transit; but I'm able to overpower the yoke and keep our wings level. What is going on? Flaps and ailerons are independent systems. This should not be happening. ""Set 3000 feet; vertical speed down 1000 fpm…Gear down; Flaps 15"" and with the Flaps 15 selection here goes the yoke oscillating left and right again. ""Flaps 25…Flaps 30…Below the Line."" The yoke was pulling with each flap selection. I visually verify Gear Down and Green; Flaps 30; Speed Brake Armed. We are on the Glide Slope. There will not be a go around. Something inside told me I wanted a less aggressive brake application; so around 1000 feet I tell the FO to select Autobrakes 2. With continual lateral inputs I'm able to keep the aircraft balanced on the roll axis. At approximately 20 feet Tail Strike; Tail Strike; Tail Strike is flashing on my HUD. I relax a little back pressure. Smooth touch down. Fly the nose wheel down. CA ""Manual Braking."" FO ""Autobrakes Off.""  We are tracking centerline and there is a sudden jerk/pull to the right. Very odd. Like a sudden rudder kick; a grabby brake; or a right hand gust but winds are 350. I'm able to correct with brake and rudder. We slow to a near stop and clear at [taxiway] 1. Airport rescue and fire fighting asks if we require any assistance. ""Tell him negative and thank you."" ZZZ asks if we [are able to continue to gate]. ""Yes."" Ramp clears us straight in to the gate. ZZZ Ramp authorizes us to park with DGS (Docking Guidance System) only. I set the brake and we complete our shutdown flow. I tell the FO to keep the door closed. I need a minute to get myself composed. The severity of what we experienced is kicking in. I make a quick PA; ""Ladies and Gentlemen; I spoke to our maintenance team and they want to take this aircraft to the hanger for troubleshooting; so please gather all of your belongings; exit the aircraft; go to the top of the jetway; and we will have further instructions. Thank you again for your patience."" I had not really spoken to maintenance; but I knew the aircraft was done; and the FO and I were done. While the passengers were deplaning; I was able to finish my duties. I asked the FO to see if we had a tail strike. We did not. I called my dispatcher and he asked me if I landed overweight. This is when I was first aware that yes we landed overweight. I spoke to the Duty pilot; two local maintenance teams; and received a call from my Chief Pilot. The logbook entries took some time for me to complete; because I was trying to describe the malfunction with accurate wording; and because the aircraft maintenancelog discrepancy blocks are character limited. With 8 discrepancy entries complete; we turned the aircraft over to maintenance and went home.Reflection 1) Both pilots were needed to meet the demands of the situation. This is exactly why we must keep two pilots at the controls. I was incredibly saturated with maintaining aircraft control; and intensely thinking through the malfunction and appropriate tasks. When I gave commands to the FO; I had to trust that he was completing them exactly as I asked. I was only able to divert my attention for very brief moments to verify the big items: ILS Identifier; Gear Down and Green; Flaps 30; Speed Brakes Armed. Everything else was a bonus. The FO did a magnificent job of executing PM duties. Further; he led me with appropriate questions that helped pull me from being overwhelmed to managing the situation; and he perfectly executed PAs that are normally performed by the CA.Reflection 2) It may have been the right hand flight spoilers that were deflecting to full stop; and not an aileron problem. This would help explain why left turns were fine; but right turns were not. I don't know for certain because this fleet does not have synoptic pages.Reflection 3) After we were safely on the gate; I located two; less severe RH Aileron write ups approximately two weeks prior to this flight. If I had seen this information prior to the flight; I would have briefed it as a threat and experienced less startle factor when we experienced the severe uncommanded roll issue. Further; those write ups may also have been a flight spoiler issues but again; we pilots don't know for certain without supporting evidence from a flight control synoptic page.Cause: TBD. Unknown mechanical malfunction resulted in aircraft longitudinal instability and extreme uncommanded roll rates. Suggestions: This fleet must be equipped with system synoptic pages. Synoptic pages provide critical information to pilots during an emergency. If we had a flight control synoptic page; we would have observed exactly what was happening with our spoilers and ailerons; and responded appropriately. As it was; we were in the blind and having to guess as to what was happening with the primary and secondary flight controls. Further; the flight synoptic page would have allowed us to create more precise write ups; thus focusing the efforts of our maintenance team; and returning the aircraft to service sooner. Additionally; my three day lookback in the aircraft maintenance log didn't reveal previous RH Aileron issues. From now on; I will do a two week review of the log.""",B737-800 Captain reported severe flight control malfunction during initial climb that required substantial manual control to maintain wings level. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed safely.

Cabin crew detected the same issues of pressure change in the cabin but the effects felt physiologically worse. The ear pressure and chest tightness became more and more noticeable as I continued with my duties and took a toll on my mind clarity. Upon descent; the cabin was preparing for a cautionary landing once again as we diverted to ZZZ. My safety compliance did not include picking up the plastic service items in my first class as my priority became to sit down in my jump seat after walking through the cabin and checking on customers using oxygen as my chest became tighter and tighter. The crew was finishing speaking to the Physician in command that had been contacted for passengers that were using oxygen for complaints of chest tightness. I walked through  assured the cabin if anybody had any medical concerns to please contact us by alerting us with the flight attendant call button. I as FA1  repeated our prepare for landing  instructions over the PA and made them aware we would be landing soon. My compliance checks were modified as I remained in my seat and my crew made their way thru the cabin. I instructed them to prepare for a cautionary landing and that sitting in our jumpseats was priority as we made our way into our descent.Upon landing the aircraft took longer to depressurize as we touched down and made our way down the runway. The entire aircraft shaked roughly for approximately 20 seconds on the way to a stop. I detected the difference in landing and called the aft galley to tell them something felt off with the landing and depressurization and to be careful of the doors in case we were still pressurized. After the call I felt extremely nauseous and head felt tight and achy. As I started to feel dizzy starting at the forward closet I felt vomit rising and made my way to the forward lav and left my jumpseat to relief myself. My FA3 remained in their jumpseat. I was able to come back to my jumpseat approximately 5 min after and remained unbuckled in case I needed to return to the restroom. I was able to disarm my door but my FA3 completed PA's for me and the crew disarming. During deplaning I was unable to remain at the door entry as I returned to the restroom to vomit. I was assisted by paramedics that met the flight and followed up care by ambulance and emergency room visit after the aircraft deplaned.Suggestions: Not use an aircraft that was and continued to malfunction. Have written procedures for what to do if FA is sick and away from jumpseat upon arrival; taxi; and deplaning.,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported the aircraft had a second pressurization malfunction during the flight. Flight Attendant experienced physiological symptoms that rendered them unable to perform all duties after landing.

We were cleared to start our descent from FL380 to FL340 and once the descent started; we noticed a shutter in the airframe. I looked at the engine gauges and saw the #1 N1 roll back to about 40 percent and spool back to normal. About a minute later the airframe shuttered again and the same roll back occurred. It was about this time that we got a call from the FAs (Flight Attendant) that there was a noticeable flame that was seen out the back of the #1 Engine. I disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and recoordinated the aircraft. We decided that the most appropriate action at this point was to shut the engine down and secure it. We ran the appropriate checklists and [requested priority handling] and requested that emergency vehicles inspect the aircraft after landing before taxiing to the gate. Approach and landing were executed without further incident. After parking at the gate; we also had engine control lights illuminated and the A Hydraulic System was showing 74 percent RF (Refill).,B737-700 flight crew reported the #1 Engine rolled back and had flames coming out of it during the top of descent. The affected was shut down and the flight crew made an uneventful landing without incident.

RVR. After a thorough brief and setup; we decided to land flaps 40 for a little more visibility. During flaps extension on final approach; the pilot monitoring selected flaps to 30°; then 40°; and ran the Landing Checklist. At that time the pilot monitoring saw the trailing edge flaps were stuck at 15° and verbalized the configuration. The pilot flying spun the speed bug back up so we didn't get too slow and said during the debrief he noticed the PFD's (Primary Flight Display) speed tape looked different that normal; but hadn't realized why until the pilot monitoring called out the failure. A missed approach was executed and [priority handling was requested]. Once the missed was completed and the aircraft stable; the pilot flying continued flying and took radio duties; while the pilot monitoring ran the QRH for Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree. That concluded that the flap handle did nothing to alter the flap position.Because of the weather in ZZZZ; the crew discussed going to the listed alternate airport of ZZZ. However; with the current fuel on board and the flaps stuck extended; decided that would not be prudent as we would land in a very low fuel state. While conducting the QRH; the procedure set us up for a flaps 15 landing. With the weather still at 1;200 ft. RVR in ZZZZ and an autoland required; we elected to use the alternate flap extension system to attempt to get the flaps to 30 as we didn't know how the aircraft would react to a flaps 15 autoland; or even if it would do an autoland at all. We deviated from the QRH to make this happen as it seems the procedure never planned on a requirement of a CAT III autoland after a flap malfunction. The flight attendants were briefed with the brief items; and a passenger announcement was made. Once realigned with final; the flap handle was moved to the 30 detent; the alternate extension was used; and the flaps and slats extended. The pilot monitoring changed the landing speeds to flaps 30 speeds and an uneventful autoland was accomplished on Runway XXL. ZZZZ ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was standing by to do an inspection which concluded with no issues and the aircraft taxied to the gate under its own power. The Chief Pilot and Dispatch were called and debriefed.,B737 Captain reported the trailing edge flaps got stuck at 15 degrees during flap extension on final approach. The flight crew performed a go-around; used an alternative solution that deviated from the QRH as it was not applicable; and safely landed.

We continued and completed the quick action procedure as well as the QRH follow ups. After completing the follow ups we completed the ECAM actions as directed by the follow up's. [Requested Priority Handling] and landing was completed uneventfully in ZZZ.I believe that possibly the FO's probe heat was not working because the failure occurred at 9 degrees Celsius in IMC but we didn't get a fault or message indicating a pitot heat failure.

At the time we were burning fuel from the center tank and the wing tanks should have both been full. Not long after; the IMBAL Alert illuminated. We began the QRH and started assessing our fuel plan. By this point our #1 Wing Tank was approximately 1;000 lbs less than the #2 Wing Tank. We noticed that we were going to be about 2000 pounds less than the fuel remaining at ZZZ waypoint ahead. Following the QRH it led us to the Engine Fuel Leak Checklist and continued to the One Engine Inoperative Checklist.After shutting the engine down; the fuel in the #1 Wing Tank no longer was decreasing and we were able to balance the fuel by burning only from the #2 Wing Tank. We [requested priority handling] and diverted to ZZZ. Upon landing in ZZZ we stopped on the runway and had CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) inspect the aircraft. After their assessment; they said that there was not a leak detected and they followed us to the gate. CFR evaluated the aircraft at the gate and deemed that no leaks were detected before leaving. Of note; we attempted to notify Dispatch via ACARS but did not complete the task due to time compression as we diverted to ZZZ.,B737 First Officer reported a fuel imbalance developed in cruise. Flight crew shut down an engine; rebalanced fuel and diverted to a landing.

The only ECAM I saw was ENG FAIL 2. I leveled the aircraft off. We told ATC; [requested priority handling] and began working the problem and heading back to ZZZ. I needed to get lower due to altitude capability as well as we weren't far from ZZZ so I continued down; realizing I wasn't cleared lower and busy flying the aircraft I remember seeing 20;700 and then ATC cleared me to a lower altitude. First Officer did a great job of communicating as he worked through the ECAM. Once the engine was secure; we discussed the approach into ZZZ. I believe the weather was approximately 600 OVC and 2 miles. I had the FO (First Officer) send a message to dispatch with our issue and intentions; briefed the flight attendants and notified the passengers. We did the overweight landing checklist and safely landed the airplane at approximately 177;700 pounds. We landed without incident and after fire and rescue made sure we had no external issues; we proceeded to the gate.,A321 flight crew reported an engine failure during departure climb. Flight crew returned and landed at departure airport uneventfully.

When we arrived to the aircraft; we were met by the contract mechanic who stated that he had tested the system; and found no faults. We conferenced Maintenance Control and we all agreed that the aircraft was not safe to fly; and they stated they would be flying a part in from ZZZ1; on a flight that arrived hours later. We obtained a day room and went to the hotel. We arrived back at the airport in time to depart at the expected departure time as given by Maintenance. Maintenance stated they had replaced a faulty part; it tested normally; and we were cleared to depart. A Maintenance Release was obtained; and we departed. Most of the flight was uneventful until we approached TOD (Top of Descent) for ZZZ. While at FL400; in clear; smooth air; both engines; and the APU fire warnings sounded; including the fire bell; Master Caution; and also associated Overheat lights. Each of the warnings was cycling on and off; at approximately 2-second intervals. At times; we were able to clear the warning; only to have it reappear seconds later. I transferred control to the FO (First Officer); and I referenced the FM (Flight Manual) for guidance (there wasn't any). I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch informing them of the issue and requested a phone patch with Maintenance Control (which never occurred). While waiting for a response; the FO and I agreed that ZZZ was the closest appropriate airport; and we should [request priority handling] as we have now lost the ability to detect any engine or APU fire or overheat. I [requested priority handling] with ATC and informed Dispatch of our intentions. I briefed the FAs on Brief items; but stated I did not wish them to prepare the cabin; nor did I plan to evacuate upon landing. We elected to stay at FL400 for a few minutes before starting the descent for favorable winds/groundspeed. Throughout the descent; the cycling of all of the fire warnings continued. We flew the visual approach to Runway XXL; and stopped on Taxiway 1. The FO coordinated with CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) and Airport Ops and they stated they had no indication of any fire or overheat condition; so we taxied to the gate. We requested CFR and Ops follow us to the gate. After parking; we debriefed the situation with maintenance (who met us at the gate); and I called the Chief Pilot). I then proceeded to the layover hotel.,B737 flight crew reported a malfunction with the aircraft fire detection systems. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

With that; we incurred a FLT CNTL SLATS FAULT ECAM message. Reviewed Quick Items checklist and performed ECAM procedure. Procedure did not rectify situation and left flats in flaps 1 commanded position. Requested ATC to stay at 8;000' and asked for a vector away from ZZZ. Eventually was put in a holding pattern. FO assumed controls and radio in the holding pattern while Captain continued completing ECAM Procedures; ECAM Follow-ups; advising Flight Attendants and passengers of airport diversion due to an aircraft mechanical condition which required us to land at ZZZ1. FO sent a message to dispatch via ACARS; [advised air traffic control]; and requested from ATC [runway] XXR for landing; safety vehicles standing by; a 20 mile landing final and asked for gate availability in ZZZ1 through Dispatch. Once both Pilots were back together as Pilot Flying and Pilot Not Flying; landing Aassessment was reviewed; non-routine landing procedure was reviewed; approach briefing to RWY XXR was given; a summary of how a No Flap/No Slat Landing will be performed and final checklists were completed. finally; Captain assumed controls for the Approach phase; was given vectors to final approach course and executed landing to RWY XXR. Upon landing; aircraft was met by Safety Vehicles on Taxiway 1. Safety Vehicles accessed condition of Aircraft and after Safety Personnel gave Aircraft all clear message to Flight Crew; Aircraft taxied to the Gate escorted by the Safety Vehicles. Cause: The flaps remained in the flaps retracted position.,A321 pilot reported the flaps failed to extend during arrival. Flight crew diverted and landed safely.

The CAB ALT master warning went off and I saw the cabin was climbing uncontrollably. We proceeded to put on our Oxygen masks and [requested priority handling] while initiating a decent to 10;000 feet. The FO (First Officer) ran our checklists and we returned to ZZZ and landed with no further issues.,B767 Captain reported pressurization failure and a return to the departure airport.

Engine #2 subsequently failed.  Accomplished QRC/QRH/ECAM procedures; associated follow-ups; Non-Routine Landing and normal checklists. [Requested priority handling] with ATC; notified Dispatch through ACARS. Flew STAR routing during descent with altitude step-downs by ATC as requested. Accomplished Flaps 3 single-engine landing in VMC via ILS XX. Inspected by ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) after rollout. Taxied to the gate with one ARFF vehicle following as precaution.Cause: Insidious nature of vibration; event occurrence at the onset of a high-workload flight-phase; short distance and time to landing to complete all checklists; communications and notifications. Helpful to have a jumpseater upfront to provide overwatch of procedures and confirm ATC clearances.Suggestions: Unknown at this time until results of the failed engine inspection are complete and made available.,A321 First Officer reported an engine failure.

We asked ATC to level off. We did the initial actions and then the Captain transferred controls to me and verified I had the radios. He asked me to notify ATC and ask to return to ZZZ while he ran the ECAM actions; follow-up; QRH; Non-normal landing distance; overweight landing; and non-routine landing procedures. He also kept the flight attendants; passengers and company in the loop while I flew the plane and got set up for the approach and landing back into ZZZ. We let ATC and the company know we would need to come to a stop on the runway and to be towed to the gate and requested emergency vehicles standing by. We proceeded with the approach and landing and complied with the QRH procedures. We came to a stop on the runway and had the ARTCC check us out and once clear we requested to be towed to the gate. We parked and ran the required checklists. ATC and the ARTCC crew did a great job. I was impressed the company was ready with the super tug and an open gate upon our return. The captain did a great job with decision making; keeping all parties informed; and dividing attention between managing the emergency and making sure the airplane was being flown safely. The Mechanic said when he opened the engine cowling; hydraulic fluid was everywhere. I don't know what caused the malfunction or how it could have been prevented.,Air carrier First Officer reported the yellow hydraulic system failed during climb on the A321.

We [requested priority handling] and returned after running the QRH flaps disagree checklist. Normal flaps 15  overweight landing on YYL ZZZ followed.  ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) noted slightly raised brake temps and followed us to the gate where we were met by maintenance. Cause: Mechanical malfunction.,Air carrier crew reported a return to the departure airport; for an overweight landing; after a failed flap retraction during initial climb.

We followed the ECAM procedures and immediately declared an emergency and requested a lower altitude. At an initial altitude of FL 240; we realized that we needed lower due to aircraft performance and descended to FL 180. During the decent with the #1 engine at idle; engine parameters normal except for the N2 Vib in the 4-5 range. As we continued to run checklists the vibration increased to a limit where we made the decision to shut down the #1 engine. A call to dispatch was made to notify them of our situation and our diversion airport and requested WX and Notams. Flight Attendants briefed and passengers notified. A normal landing with ARFF present in ZZZ and requested ARFF to follow us to the gate as well.  Logbook entries made for inflight shutdown of the #1 engine and overweight landing. Overweight; wet runways and possible ice accretion is why we decided on ZZZ. More available runway length.,A321 pilot reported increasing engine vibration in cruise and an engine stall message displayed. Flight crew performed inflight engine shutdown; diverted and landed safely.

It's common knowledge about these floors that need to be maintained/replaced/repaired on the B777 and on multiple wide body planes this is the same issue. Just on this flight today my crew named 4 other flight attendants they knew that this same incident had happened to. In their stories mostly the #2 being injured as they are on the cart by themself back there. I would be curious if you pull injury reports pertaining to 777 and/or 787 galley floors what would be found. As well as maintenance write ups and flight attendant reports. As the #2 I mostly set up the galley; so procedure is Flight Attendant (FA) 3 and 6 and 7 and 8 have carts in each aisle together. The 2 (me) is on a cart alone; going partially up aircraft right aisle from back; back to the galley; then partway up aircraft left aisle; a 'horse shoe' to help. When I pulled back from aircraft right to go up aircraft left aisle; I backed into the galley with the cart and tried to avoid this bulge; but the cart wheel caught it at an angle (not wheel straight back) causing the top heavy beverage cart full of sodas etc; to tip over and crash to the ground. I tried to catch it but it was way too heavy. It came down on my toe. I'm now out waiting for my appointment for an x-ray to see if my toe/foot is broken.If the company would properly maintain their aircraft and not create a hazardous working environment for crew in neglecting to do so. This could also jeopardize passenger safety as they pass through the galley; or heaven forbid if someone tripped in an evacuation. I don't think procedure is wrong; I feel it's safe to be on the cart by yourself if you have a level surface to work on. Just if someone else was on the other side in this instance MAYBE they could have helped catch it; but they're incredibly heavy so very likely not. We shouldn't have to speculate about catching carts working in unsafe conditions. Turbulence happens; but this was completely avoidable.,B777 Flight Attendant reported receiving an injury after a service cart had fallen over due to a damaged galley floor.

Maintain aircraft control; asked for lower altitude to return to VMC conditions at the same time that we complied with the appropriate QRC; QRH Checklists; clarify condition with PM and elected to shut the engine down. Vibration stopped. [Requested priority handling]; after that reengaged the autopilot; and at approximately FL190 exchange the flight controls. Talk to Dispatch; Flight Attendants; Passengers; ATC; review Diversion Checklist and divert to ZZZ. Exchange flight controls again and accomplish One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist. Captain accomplished uneventful landing and rescue equipment standing by.,A B737-700 flight crew reported a loud bang followed by excessive vibration in one engine and diverted to a nearby airport.

I was PF (Pilot Flying). The autopilot was on. The autopilot remained engaged. I shallowed the climb. We analyzed the situation and determined that the # 2 Engine had seized. I instructed the FO (First Officer) to [request priority handling] with ATC and ask for a turn back to ZZZ. We completed the Engine Failure Severe Damage QRC and then I transferred control to the FO; while I completed the checklists. I advised the Flight Attendants and asked if they saw or smelled anything unusual. They were aware that the engine had failed and described a large fireball that erupted briefly from the engine. I sent a diversion ACARS message to Dispatch with the note; Engine failure"" in the comments section. I also called ZZZ Ops and ensured they knew we were returning; and that Dispatch was aware. I updated the performance data and sent for landing data for Runway XX. I only sent for flaps 30 numbers as I was getting task loaded at this point and ATC had just turned us onto a final approach. I knew the runway was one of the longest; so I wasn't really concerned with having the exact stopping margin. Had I sent for the Flaps 15 Engine Failure numbers; I would have also received the prompt for brake cooling numbers. With the distraction of coordinating with ATC and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting); we did not check those after landing. I took control at about 1;000ft agl. We were a little fast and I used the speedbrake at flaps 15 to slow us down. We were also slightly low on the PAPI; but I was able to easily correct; and we landed uneventfully in the Touchdown Zone. I stopped the aircraft in the runway and instructed the ARFF Crew to inspect the entire aircraft. After receiving the ""All Clear;"" we taxied to the gate.""",Air carrier Captain reported an engine failure during climb. The pilots turned back to the departure airport.

Oil quantity was indicating 0. I asked the FO (First Officer) to run the checklist and I took the aircraft and accomplished the immediate action item for Engine Limit Surge or Stall. I disconnected the auto-throttles and retarded thrust lever on the number one engine to idle. The low oil indication did not change but was still in the amber range. Shortly thereafter the oil pressure went into the red range and we got a flashing amber indication on the number one engine. We immediately requested a descent to FL220 and accomplished a drift down with a level change and airspeed set to 240 KIAS. Continuing with the checklist it directed us to shutdown the engine which we confirmed and accomplished. I would estimate the engine only ran for 1-2 minutes with abnormal indication before shutdown. We checked the checklist for ENG out and confirmed FL220 as optimum. At this point we determined ZZZ was only 38 miles away. We [advised ATC] and the intention to divert to ZZZ. I sent a quick message to dispatch and changed the destination to ZZZ and reset the destination field elevation. Since we had significant altitude to lose we had time to alert the FAs (Flight Attendants) with a phone call and I made a PA to the passengers.The rest of the arrival and descent was relatively uneventful. We asked for Rwy XXR as it is the longest. Upon taxiing clear of the runway emergency vehicles met the aircraft and confirmed leaking fluid from the number one engine. We taxied to the gate with emergency vehicles following out of an abundance of caution. Deplaning was uneventful.,Air carrier pilots reported the loss of oil quantity and pressure during cruise flight. The pilots stated they shut the engine down and diverted.

We [requested priority] since our slats remained in the 0 position which is not our normal landing configuration. We also advised ATC that we needed to land on Runway XL due to performance reasons. I notified the flight attendants and gave them a briefing. I made an announcement to our customers informing them of our issue and that out of an ""abundance of caution"" we may have vehicles around the aircraft after landing. I also explained to our customers that we expected a normal landing and taxi to the gate and should be on the ground in about five minutes. I called operations and informed them of our [priority situation]. We landed and taxied to the gate without further incident.

We leveled at 10;000 ft. and began abnormal for ENG 2 FAIL. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Control. We advised the flight attendants to prepare. We contacted Dispatch with lost Engine 2; going to ZZZZ1 [Airport]. We performed Diversion Checklist and Overweight Landing Checklist. With ZZZZ1 Approach we advised on initial contact [priority] aircraft and requested to go to ZZZZ1 [Airport]. At this time we were at 14;000 ft. for terrain clearance and were given direct to ZZZZZ1 for the RNAV XX at ZZZZ1 [Airport]. We gave them souls on board and FOB in lb. as requested by ZZZZ1 Control. We requested Fire/Crash Rescue. We accomplished an arrival and landing briefing followed by Approach Checklist. Spoke to flight attendants again; still preparing and everything is going smoothly. We are planning to land; pull off the runway; and have Fire Rescue evaluate from the outside. They acknowledged and stated we are all ready. Landing was uneventful and as briefed got off the runway onto the adjacent taxiway. Remain seated was announced to the cabin. Accomplished Landing Checklist. Fire Rescue gave the all clear. Fire Rescue followed us to the gate as we requested. Parked at [Gate] XX and all passengers were disembarked via airstairs. Our touchdown weight was 152;000 lbs.

We planned for a normal landing flaps 30 and auto brakes 3 since the wind was 070/05 due to a slight 1 knot tailwind after doing a landing assessment. It was a normal touchdown; 7 seconds after crossing the threshold; smooth touchdown. After touchdown I opened the thrust reversers and noticed that the auto brakes were not working. I applied smooth pressure on the brake pedals to stop the aircraft and realized I had no brakes. The Captain took control of the aircraft at that point and realized his brakes were not working as well. At that point he went into full reverse thrust. We were near high speed taxiway and the aircraft was still slowing down. At that point I called the tower and [requested priority handling] and told them we had lost brakes system on the aircraft. We were able to stop the aircraft within the runway safety area of XXL beyond the runway landing threshold lights. I really don't know what we could have done differently.,Air carrier flight crew reported complete loss of aircraft brake system during landing rollout.

XA:00 am local time.We were told by ZZZ approach to maintain 210 knots initially and we were configured at Flaps 5 with gear up. As we got closer; ZZZ instructed us to slow to 180 knots until the FAF (ZZZZZ). As we slowed down inside of the FAF and began configuring; we noticed that the flaps were not going below Flaps 5. We began to speed up to correct maneuvering speed of approximately 190~200 knots before aborting the approach and imitating a go-around. We requested a box pattern over the coast away from the terrain and Captain flew us out until reaching the initial target of 3;000 ft.  The autopilot was engaged on after that point. I began to dive into the QRH and settled on Trailing Edge Flap Disagree because of the disagreement between the flap handle position and the actual flap position without any split in the needle.  I asked Captain to verify that we are on the correct checklist and he did.  After that conversation; Captain took over the QRH checklist while I handled the plane and the radio. Captain completed the QRH procedure and verified each step with me. We talked about figuring our own landing distance calculations and steps before continuing. We completed all the way up to opening the guarded switch and pulling the alternate flaps switch as the checklists calls for. We briefed each other and came to a conclusion that due to fuel and drag penalties of putting gear and flaps down; as the checklists calls for; we were going to finish the communication part before continuing and heading in towards ZZZ. I believe we were approximately 9K-10K pounds of fuel when we went around initially in ZZZ.We [requested priority handling] and told ATC we will be ready to head back into ZZZ in about 5-10 minutes. Captain briefed the Flight Attendants and completed the brief; then Captain made a professional PA to the passenger of what was going on. While that was happening; I ACARSd the dispatcher a simple message of what was going on and what our plan was. After that we both came back in together and continued the checklist and began to utilize the alternate flap switch to lower the flaps and complete the [priority handling] checklist. The checklists successfully allowed us to lower the flaps to 15 and make an approach.We then headed back into ZZZ's ILS XXR and landed uneventfully.The ARFF truck followed us to the gate while checking our brake temperature.Everything was normal and we parked at the gate with the flaps down and maintenance was subsequently notified.,B737 Air Carrier crew reported a trailing edge flap malfunction while on final approach. The crew performed a go around and returned for a safe landing with partial flaps.

All was still normal as we climbed through 10;000 feet and I checked/announced the pressurization panel (Cabin Altitude indicated near Sea Level"").   We received a clearance to climb to a final cruising altitude from ZZZ [Approach] of FL340 (changed from original FL350);  changed the FMC and pressure controller altitude to reflect 340 - we didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.  We were cleared direct ZZZZZ.   We reached flight level 340 and were there approximately 8 minutes.  ZZZ [Approach] cleared us to switch to enroute frequencies. Soon after; FO (First Officer)  scanned the overhead and acutely recognized / announced that the differential pressure was displaying approx 6.5 which is less than we typically see.   With that awareness; I noticed and pointed out that our cabin altitude pressure was very close to 10;000 and moments later the cabin altitude warning horn began to sound. FO and I immediately proceeded with our immediate action items (O2 on 100%; crew comm. established; seat belt sign on). I pulled out the QRC for the Cabin Altitude Warning and began the checklist. Since we had just left ZZZ freq. and we had not yet left the FIR; I switched back to ZZZ [Approach] and asked for a turn back to ZZZ2 [Airport]. I [requested priority handling] and proceeded with the checklist and descent. The Outflow valve appeared fully closed before confirmed with checklist. PASS OXYGEN switch was selected ON and the masks were dropped in the back. In the course of the descent; I believe the cabin altitude got to 12k but didn't see anything beyond that.   I spoke with the flight attendants and the passengers.   When we reached 10k and were in hold to burn fuel to reach max landing weight; we put controller back to auto and it seemed to control cabin fine at the lower altitude.    We proceeded with vectors to an RNAV approach and uneventful landing to runway XXR at ZZZ2.   During the process; we communicated several times with the flight attendants (they were very calm and professional throughout) and that was reflected by the passengers cooperative and calm nature as well.   FO was equally professional with his focus in continuing to prioritize flying the aircraft first in a very skilled manner.   His recognition of the pressure differential abnormality certainly helped lessen the startle effect that could have made the situation more difficult.     There were no other faults associated with the event (no failure of the pressure controller or pack faults).     The cabin altitude warning horn and the cabin altitude/differential pressure gauge were our only indications of faults with the system.   Initial speed in the hold at ZZZZZ1 was inadvertently 250 kts but corrected in the first turn.  One concern and difficulty was communicating with audio panel that used a rubberband to hold switch in the intercom position.   The rubber band appeared on but was not holding in the select position.""",B-737 air carrier crew reported a pressurization malfunction at cruise before entering oceanic airspace. The crew returned to an alternate airport and landed safely.

Sent multiple times due to Runway XXC not automatically loading. During multiple attempts of requesting correct data; sent one request for incorrect data request. Requested data again with correct weight. Recognized error and discussed with 3rd pilot. Since [Runway] XXC had to be manually loaded; unknowingly manually loaded incorrect weight from incorrect paper final takeoff data. Upon rotation; FA (Flight Attendant) reported possible tail strike. Discussed and analyzed issues and options; recognized possibility of tail strike and [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ for landing.,B767 First Officer reported the Flight Attendant notified the flight deck of a possible tail strike on rotation. Before takeoff; there were multiple attempts to request data; with some correct and some incorrect. As the runway to be used had to be manually loaded; incorrect weight was mistakenly put in during the process.

We had 3 green lights above the gear handle and on the lower ECAM indicating the gear was down and locked. After reviewing the ECAM action items we concluded that the safest course of action was to continue and land. We landed with no issue and I taxied back to the gate using differential braking. After exiting the taxiway the N/W STEERING FAULT went away.The factors causing the event were mechanical issues related to the aircraftI don't know that there is anything anyone could have done to prevent the mechanical failure; however a discussion regarding what's acceptable for taxiing with n/w steering inop using differential braking in the training curriculum would have given me more insight on how to proceed after landing.,A319 pilot reported landing gear and steering fault messages during landing gear extension for approach. Flight crew continued to landing and taxied to gate using differential braking.

No ECAM smoke or fire related messages were displayed.The cabin crew immediately called to notify us that customers and themselves were detecting the same burning plastic odor near row XX. It's associated overhead bin was very hot to the touch by two different F/As; but no smoke was visible. Customers were being relocated to other seats; away from the affected row.I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ center and diverted to ZZZ1. The cabin crew was briefed; and provided them an ETE of 10 minutes before landing. The FO and I briefed that he was still the PF; to coordinate with ATC as I would be focused on the cabin; that we will transfer controls prior to turning final; and that we will stop the aircraft on the runway to assess the cabin situation before continuing.The odor intensified. I began reaching for the crew O2 mask and contemplated running the smoke / fume removal QRH. But it quickly stabilized and began to decrease afterwards. The odor was not causing significant irritation to the eyes; nose or throat. We therefore prioritized getting on the ground as soon as possible.The cabin crew reported that the row XX overhead bin was still hot; but the burning plastic odor had decreased. However; they received conflicting reports from customers who claimed that they felt heat coming from underneath. I checked the cargo smoke panel and verified that the smoke lights were not illuminated. ATC cleared us for the visual XXR. The touchdown was normal and under max landing weight. The burnt plastic odor continued to persist during the decent and landing.After touchdown; I applied max manual braking and set the parking brake to ON after coming to a complete stop. The cabin crew reported that the hot overhead bin had cooled off; but the burnt plastic smell persisted. An evacuation was not warranted; therefore we proceeded to taxi to the gate.Nearing the gate; the odor on the flight deck had mostly dissipated. One of the first persons to board the aircraft was a security inspector. She detected the residual burnt plastic odor; starting on the flight deck to row XX. She did not detect the odor beyond row XX. She performed a quick search of the bags in the overhead bin of row XX; but found no indications of fire or heat damage to neither bags or bin.The burnt plastic odor discrepancy was documented into the aircraft's maintenance log. The odor was described to assist tech ops in troubleshooting. The FO and I declared ourselves fatigued. During the de-brief with the cabin crew; it appeared that the burning plastic odor decreased after the flight attendant had de-selected the IFE (In-flight entertainment)/ PED (Personal Electronic Device) system.,Air carrier Captain reported a burning plastic odor during descent with no aircraft indications. The flight crew diverted where a safe landing was completed.

I was the flying pilot. I spooled the throttles to approximately 40% N1 per procedure; verified N1s were matched; then announced and engaged TO/GA when a split in the throttles was immediately felt; followed by a red auto throttles (A/T) fail light. We rejected the takeoff and advised ATC. This all happened prior to reaching 10 knots. We pulled off the runway after informing Tower of the rejected takeoff; sat for several minutes and ran through the appropriate checklist; channels; etc; and elected to attempt a second takeoff. The same issue happened on the second takeoff attempt (under 10 knots); we rejected; advised ATC; and returned to gate and were met by maintenance. The mechanics found faults with the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) and ASM which warranted an MEL deferral of the autothrottle system. After a delay we headed back out for takeoff with no autothrottles and were cleared for takeoff once again. Immediately after lift off; we lost all lateral and vertical navigation symbology on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and the Mode Control Panel (MCP). A [request for priority handling] was declared on initial check in with the Departure Controller where we requested and received runway heading and a level off-altitude right away from ATC. I hand flew the airplane using raw data for a few minutes with some navigation sources eventually coming back online; but were unsure if the sources were reliable. The autopilot was eventually reengaged successfully and I monitored the progress while guarding the flight controls and manually manipulating thrust as needed. We then ran through appropriate checklists; protocols; and procedures and had to make an overweight [priority handling] landing and requested for Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to be present. We set up for a long final to XXC at ZZZ with the help of ATC. I performed the landing and rollout which was uneventful. We pulled off the runway to a complete stop and had ARFF inspect the exterior of the aircraft including the gear and brakes before continuing taxiing to the gate. Maintenance met us at the gate once again advised they would be removing the aircraft from service.,B-737 air carrier crew reported an initial rejected takeoff due to faulty auto throttle system then a subsequent departure with loss of lateral and vertical guidance information on the aircraft PFD and MCP flight instruments after takeoff. The crew returned to the departure airport and landed safely overweight.

Checking engine indications; crew saw L Eng Oil Qty was zero with pressure at approx 125 PSI. Crew discussed indications; saw oil pressure continuing to decrease. I divided cockpit duties with flying FO (First Officer) taking flight and radio duties; Captain running checklists; Relief Pilots assisting both. We advised ATC (finally acknowledged by ATC after second notice and another aircraft telling ATC we were calling!). Following Eng Oil Press checklist; engine was shutdown per checklist with oil psi approx 90 at time of shutdown. Flight was to ZZZZ; a lot of fuel on board. I made the decision dump fuel rather than do an over weight landing. 30 minutes to dump fuel. Uneventful Single Engine landing followed. Airport Fire/ Rescue inspected jet after clearing runway and we taxied to gate under own power. Returned to Gate.,Boeing 777-200 flight crew reported receiving a left engine low oil pressure EICAS message during initial climbout. The crew shut down the engine and returned to the departure airport.

We followed the checklist and turned the pump off. About 20 minutes later we noticed the hydraulic quantity in system A drop to 19%. We then [advised ATC] and diverted to ZZZ [airport]. After landing we stopped on the runway and had the Landing gear pinned. We were then towed to the gate.Cause: Rupture in the hydraulic system.Suggestion: When the fluid decreased to 19%; I expected a Total Loss of system A. The standpipe in the system kept enough fluid to maintain some system pressure. I believe the checklist should state this in someway.,B737-800 Captain reported they received a hydraulic low pressure light during cruise in System A prompting the crew to divert.

We departed ZZZ at XA:25 on a rescheduled delayed departure flight to ZZZZ. There were four pilots on the augmented flight. During engine start we got a Configuration Gear; TO configuration flaps EICAS during engine start. After about :10 seconds the EICAS went away. The relief pilot said he had seen a EPR spike during start and we concluded that the EPR spike had been a glitch and set off the EICAS to think we had applied takeoff power. Systems returned to normal and we continued.The departure was normal and uneventful. I was pilot flying and we used Runway XX with a slight tailing crosswind. During climb on the ZZZZZ2 departure we were turned to the north. As I had flaps retracted and accelerated I noticed a EICAS THRUST ASSYMETRY TAC. I pointed to the EICAS and continued climbing as I directed the FO (First Officer) to complete after takeoff checklist and run the checklist for the TAC (Thrust Asymmetry Compensation). At that point we noticed a red box around EGT on right engine. The engine was operating normally at that time but was about 70 degrees higher than the left engine. The red box showed we had a EGT limit during the climb. We continued climing to a safe altitude and requested a level off at 14000 and a vector clear of traffic as we worked a checklist. While ATC vectored us around traffic we got another EICAS Eng EEC (Electronic Engine Control) Mode R.The checklists had us reset the EEC switches to ALT. The relief pilot mentioned that the Eng Lin/Surge/Stall u checklist would be appropriate as we had a indication expedience. We reviewed that checklist and concluded the engine was stabilized.At this point after crew discussions and completing the tasks on the checklists I made the decision that we should return to ZZZ and land. We had stayed within 30-35 miles from ZZZ as we worked the situation. We contacted dispatch on Satcom and patched to Maintenancel. A discussion of all the faults and situation concluded in agreement with ZZZ landing as safest plan. I discussed with Maintenance that I would rather not dump fuel and if we could safely land overweight we would do that. We had Dispatch send the performance data to conclude that a safe 30 degree landing could be made on Runway XXC at ZZZ and also ensure a single engine go around with performance if it was needed. Our weight allowed this and we briefed Runway XXC; for ILS approach. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested clearance to Runway XXC.After a briefing we were vectored to join Runway XXC. I slowed the aircraft early and configured to ensure limits and speeds were safe. A heavy landing has some differences and handling is challenging. I used Autobrake 2 and Flap 30 to decrease stress on the aircraft. The landing was normal landing and I gently applied brakes and we were able to exit normally only about 2/3 of the runway. Fire crews inspected the plane and we continued to the gate.,B-777 Captain reported after takeoff an engine showed an EGT exceedance. The pilots returned to the departure station.

A few minutes later I looked down and noticed we were losing fuel rapidly out of the right tank. The imbalance was now 2000 pounds and increasing. I pointed it out to the captain who was Pilot Monitoring (PM). He [requested priority]; notified dispatch via code on ACARS and started to run checklists. While he did that I turned us back to ZZZ and setup for the approach. During this we had the Flight Attendants (FAs) look out the right wing to see if they saw us loosing fuel. The Captain (CA) also briefed them on the return and that it would be a precautionary landing. The checklist had us shutdown the number 2 engine. The Captain shutdown the engine and I continued us toward ZZZ for an approach to Runway XXR. We had an uneventful single engine approach and landing. Clearing the runway emergency vehicles looked and didn't see any fuel leaking. We returned to the gate and gave the aircraft to Maintenance.,Air carrier First Officer reported during climbout the fuel quantity system began to show an increasing imbalance between tanks. The pilot returned to the departure station.

The airplane used was Aircraft X; a B777-200. After climbing to our cruising altitude of FL370 and approximately one hour into the flight; while the Relief Pilot was on break; the Captain and I noticed the forward left windshield was arcing in the lower right corner. We watched for approximately 45 seconds as the arc moved from the lower right corner; up and diagonally to the middle of the windshield. Shortly after the arc ceased; we heard a loud pop and watched as the windshield began to shatter. We were not aware which layer/pane failed.At this time; EICAS messages began to appear on the upper EICAS screen and I stated 'My aircraft' and continued to fly the airplane while the Captain completed the checklists. The Window Heat L and the Window Damage FWD L messages appeared and he accomplished both checklists in accordance with Company standard operating procedures.Once the checklists were complete; we began a discussion on the need to divert and we requested the Relief Pilot return to the flight deck to help with coordination and workload management.At this point we utilized HF radio [requested priority handling] to ZZZ and CPDLC technology alerting them of our need to divert off of our assigned track. In accordance with oceanic procedures; we turned on all exterior lighting; transmitted our intentions on both and turned to begin our divert.There was a discussion about retuning to ZZZ or diverting to ZZZ1. We decided ZZZ1 would be the best option due to the forecast weather deteriorating in ZZZ. At this time; we also overheard reports of severe turbulence in the ZZZ area; so ZZZ1 made the most sense considering the situation.We were able to coordinate a descent to FL250 and requested speed at our discretion. That was approved and we descended and slowed to 280 kts. We had some time and referenced the QRH for any supplemental information that might be pertinent to our situation.We requested ZZZ1 weather and briefed an ILS XXL approach into ZZZ1. The winds were reported to be 230/23G38.Approximately 100 miles east of ZZZ1; we accomplished the descent checklist and descended to 11;000 feet and slowed to 250 kts in preparation for the arrival and landing. As a precaution; we also requested Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARF) be available on landing.I flew the approach and landing and it was normal. We taxied off of Runway XXL under our own power and subsequently parked at gate 1.I appreciate working with the FO's. At all times; they were professional and efficient in their communication. They; along with the flight attendants; did a fantastic job that contributed to a successful diversion. It should be noted that the Captain's forward windshield had been written up a week prior on Day 0 for de-laminating all corners and the Maintenance Discrepancy was put on. There was also an info to maintenance item on Day 1 of the left window heat needing to be reset prior to departure and then again in flight. Additionally; there was a separate info item to maintenance on Day 2 4 for 'EICAS window heat R side.'A thorough review and potential streamlining of the deferral process especially in instances with multiple and common write ups. A requirement to shorten deferral times in order to fix issues.,B777 flight crew reported the Captain's forward window shattered at FL370. The flight returned to the mainland.

I looked up to the hydraulic pumps and saw the ""A"" HYD ENG (Engine) pump light flickering as well. I quickly switch the bottom MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) from Engine to Hydraulics and saw the A system quantity rapidly dropping. I directed my FO (First Officer) to reference the QRH and we immediately shut the system A ENG and HYD pumps off. Unfortunately; the quantity was already at 17% and shutting the pumps off; did little to stop the drop. We immediately advised ATC and asked for holding while we finished the QRH and contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control. I suggested and we all agreed that diverting to ZZZ [airport] was in our best interests due to low ceiling and rain at ZZZ1 but VMC and dry runway at ZZZ; as well as better facilities and maintenance at ZZZ.  We were literally 150 miles from both airports. I briefed the flight attendants as well as explained to the passengers what was going on and why we were going to ZZZ instead of ZZZ1; and then we headed directly to ZZZ. Upon arrival into ZZZ; we had to manually configure the landing gear; so we opted to do so a little early to ensure we had enough time to fully configure so as to not need a go around because with manual gear extension; once it's down; it's down for good. We finished all appropriate deferred items on the checklist and approach and landing were both uneventful on runway XXC at ZZZ. Outside of sluggish controls and left thrust reverser not working correctly; we landed safely and taxied to the gate. ATC on all levels from ZZZ center; approach; tower and ground were all extremely helpful and cleared the way for us which greatly reduced our stress and allowed us to focus on flying the jet safely while running all appropriate checklists.""",B737 flight crew reported a master caution light annunciation and noticed the hydraulic engine pump light flickering and the hydraulic quantity was low. They diverted to the most convenient airport.

We followed the checklist; contacted Maintenance and agreed to continue on to ZZZ1. Approximately 20 minutes later we noticed the hydraulic quantity drop to 19%. We then [requested priority]; and diverted to ZZZ. We also reviewed the loss of System A checklist. Upon landing; we stopped on the runway and Maintenance pinned the gear. We were then towed to the gate.Cause: Failure of the engine driven pump which caused a leak. Fluid was seen on rather #1 engine.Suggestion: I suggest that the checklist should have you check/monitor the fluid quantity following a low pressure light; to identify if fluid is leaking from the system.,An air carrier First Officer reported they diverted due to a hydraulic pump failure resulting in loss of hydraulic fluid.

Decided on a single-engine taxi. The #1 Engine was started after making the turn onto Taxiway 1. As we approached the runway; ZZZ Tower cleared us for takeoff. The two-minute warmup expired as we crossed the hold short line. Advanced the thrust levers and started to accelerate. Somewhere between 80 knots and 100 knots we started to feel a shimmy from what was assumed to be an unbalanced nosewheel--not uncommon.Over the next few seconds; the shimmy turned much more pronounced. At that point between 111 and 115 knots; the Captain decided to reject the takeoff. We rejected according to procedure; the First Officer executed his duties perfectly; and the aircraft came to a stop on the autobrakes. The Captain told the Passengers to remain seated over the PA. We set the flaps to 40 and retracted the speedbrakes.We informed the Tower of the reject and suspected tire damage. During the reject the Captain noticed a large dark object fly out in front of the aircraft and go into the grass. Airport Operations evidently found a large piece of the tire in the grass. We asked the Tower if they saw any smoke or fire; as we had no abnormal engine indications nor smoke fumes or smells in the cabin. The Tower took a closer look and said there was a little bit of smoke coming from the main gear. They called out the fire trucks and an Airport Operations vehicle was first on scene. We switched to a discreet frequency; and they informed us that indeed we had lost the left main inboard tire.At this point the fire trucks showed up and we started the APU and shutdown the engines. At this point we turned off the autobrakes and set the parking brake due to the fact that we were on a down-sloped runway and no one had any chocks. The Captain called back to the Flight Attendants to ensure that they as well as the Passengers were okay.We called ZZZ Operations and told them of the rejected takeoff and they said Maintenance is on XXX.XX nothing else. We assumed that they would call Dispatch to let them know what was going on. We put a call into ZZZ Maintenance to explain what happened. We ran the brake cooling data; and it said do not approach the gear for 30 minutes to one hour; at gate inspection needed; and 34.8M ft/lb.About 25 minutes since the reject; Maintenance showed up and informed us that they were going to replace both tires and then let us taxi to the gate. We believed towing us to the gate would be a safer option as we didn't know if there was any damage to either engine even though we had no abnormal indications. There was some confusion about where Airport Operations would meet the Super Tug but eventually it showed up.When they tried to move the aircraft; evidently the brakes on the right side had seized up. Maintenance started to work on the brakes; and the Captain discussed with Airport Operations about getting airstairs and buses to get everyone off the aircraft and back to the terminal. During this entire event; The Captain talked to the Flight Attendants and Passengers letting them know what was going on. Side note; we did get some messages from Dispatch; but because there was no chime to alert us; we overlooked them until a bit later. We kept the Passengers seated but let the Flight Attendants know that if anyone needed to use the facilities it was okay. At about the two-hour mark from leaving the gate; airstairs and buses arrived and we started deplaning. They unloaded the baggage and we rode the aircraft to the hangar.,Air carrier flight crew reported a main gear tire failed during takeoff roll; resulting in a rejected takeoff. Passengers were deplaned and the aircraft towed to the hangar.

The flight was routine throughout; the only unusual occurrence being we were assigned our slowest practical speed 300 miles out; due to holding in ZZZ. We noted that that was unusual; since the ATIS was few at 2000; 5000 broken; 9000 overcast; winds 150 at 6; 10 miles visibility. There was light rain reported in the ATIS; and a comment of rain showers distant southeast & south. Not an ATIS that would immediately cause one to think the airport was in holding. We asked the last ZZZ Center controller prior to being handed off to Approach Control why they were holding; and he said there was rain 50 miles west of ZZZ. Again; rain 50 miles away seemed not a huge impact; but I thought must be interfering with arrivals from the west; so they are slowing everyone down"". Made sense to me. Our assigned STAR was the ZZZZZX; and aside from being assigned a speed of 190 for the entire arrival; the STAR was flown uneventfully as published. When we were at position ZZZZZ1; straight south of the field; the FO commented that he could easily see the airport. We received vectors for a base turn; and the Approach Controller asked if we could see the runway. We both agreed that we could see it; the PAPI and approach lights were clearly visible; and could remain VFR easily all the way to it; so reported we did; in fact; have the runway in sight. The controller cleared us for a visual approach; and assigned us to change over to Tower at approximately position ZZZZZ2. In light of the ATIS; I had the radar on until about the base turn; but since we could see the entire airport; it seemed unnecessary for the approach; and I re-selected the terrain display due to terrain considerations in the event of a missed approach. So far; everything was completely normal and unremarkable. I disconnected the Autopilot at about 4500 AGL. Unfortunately; I don't recall if I had the Autothrottles (AT) engaged or not. The approach progressed completely normally throughout. On final approach; our entire runway; the parallel Runway XL; the terminal - all were completely visible. Everything seemed utterly normal. As we approached the FAF ZZZZZ3; I noticed there was a bit of a fuzzy characteristic to the PAPI and threshold lights; but they remained clearly visible. At no time did the Approach or Tower Controller make any comment about rain or a shower at the runway. The only information we had was the ATIS report of light rain.At approximately 300 feet; a few raindrops began to appear on the windshield. The First Officer said let him know if I wanted wipers. Within a couple of seconds; the rain intensified; and I called for wipers. What happened next was utterly unbelievable. At maybe 120 feet; the rain became a deluge! Water was sheeting up the window; and the wipers were overwhelmed. At maybe 80 feet; I completely lost any depth perception due to the sheets of water rising up the window! I tried to jump back into the HUD guidance; but I was not expecting to need it; as I would in a CAT III situation.There was a total loss of useful visual reference for maybe 4 seconds; but they were; quite literally; the MOST impactful 4 seconds of the flight! We made quite a firm touchdown; had a minor bounce; and then were on the runway and into reverse. It was the worst landing I've ever made in my 3000+ hours on the 73. Being unsure of the status of the auto throttles at this point becomes very consequential. In training; and in the AOM; we discuss the exact scenario where a firm touchdown occurs with the thrust levers not fully at idle; then a bounce; which spins the main wheels up; then retarding the levers to idle; which deploys the ground spoilers; and the classic tail strike occurs. I think that is exactly what happened on this landing - irrespective of the status of the AT engagement; I think the thrust levers did not reach the idle detent in time for the touchdown.During the taxi in; the FO and I discussed whether or not I should make a logbook entry for a hard landing. He said in his previous airline; as a 737 check airman; he had witnessed harder landings than that; and they had always turned out to be; after downloading the FMCS data; well within the limits of the aircraft. I debated with myself about whether or not to make that log entry; but we were on a re-assignment status; with a plane full of passengers and crew already boarded at the next gate over awaiting us pilots. In the subsequent hair-on-fire preparation for that next flight; the consideration of the log entry for that landing was temporarily shuffled to secondary importance.Once we were in the climbout on the next flight; shortly after transition altitude; I looked up the exact verbiage in the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook). It says 'if the pilot believes a hard landing may have occurred; an entry in the AML is required'. Just under that; it discusses thrust need not be added for a 'shallow bounce or skip'. That was our situation on that prior landing; so I felt I had complied appropriately with that guidance. The AML entry; however; I decided needed to be made. I began to compose a message to dispatch requesting the Maintenance team in ZZZ create a logbook deferral sheet item referencing the possible hard landing. Before I completed it however; I checked the routing of the aircraft; and was dismayed to see it was already off the gate and underway on a flight to ZZZ2. I was frankly unsure what to do next. In retrospect; I SHOULD have sent the message to Dispatch; to comply with FOM. Perhaps Maintenance could have arranged for the inspection at ZZZ2. We arrived ZZZ3 45 minutes late; then had an extended wait for ground transportation; and I finally stepped into the hotel room at XA:20; after expecting to be laying over in ZZZ at XR:00 the night before. I was chilled; exhausted; and feeling quite low about my horrible landing; and simply was out of gas for any further action at that point. After arising mid-morning; while getting ready to get on the deadhead flight; I checked the logbook for any issues with the aircraft. None were made; and the it had flown 4 segments; so I assumed all must be OK. I was lulled into the comfort zone of prior discussions about hard landings; both with my current FO and in previous instances of training and conversation; and the fact that most pilot perceived hard landings are; in fact; well within Boeing design limits.After landing from the deadhead segment from ZZZ3 back to ZZZ; I checked the logbook once again; and was sickened to see a logbook deferral sheet item; describing delamination and burn marks forward of the tail skid. I'm pretty certain that is the result of this incident on my flight. At least the aircraft had now been evaluated by Maintenance; and since it has continued operating; it must be within maintenance limits. Nevertheless; I feel absolutely SICK to have been the one to cause ANY level of damage to a company aircraft. I also acknowledge that; due to being well and truly tired; I failed to comply with the FOM reporting requirements.Unforecast and unreported extreme rain shaft at THE worst possible location for our approach.Suggestions: The point I want to reiterate is how completely unexpected the situation was that resulted in this irregular landing. The visual sight picture; the mild ATIS; zero commentary from ATC or other aircraft; all led both of us to believe we were on a completely normal approach. The speed at which the precipitation went from a few drops to overwhelming the wipers and causing total loss of depth perception; at literally a second or two before the flare; was unbelievable. Despite my best efforts to salvage the situation; I ended up with the undesirable aircraft state. The old adage; EVERY approach may end up as a missed approach; certainly is reinforced here. Despite having made thousands of them; the one thousand and first may be the one that bites you; and this one was mine.""",B737-800 flight crew reported heavy rain during landing flare resulting in bounced landing and tail strike.

At the moment of this occurrence; in my mind; I honestly perceived the situation as unsafe to fly; due to a possible pressurization problem; due to the high altitude elevation of this airport which is also surrounded by high altitude terrain. I was the pilot flying and rejected the takeoff. I exited the runway on Taxiway 1 and held short of Runway XL. After telling the passengers the 'this is the Captain. Remain seated. Remain seated. Remain seated.' PA; ATC allowed us to remain on Taxiway 1; holding short of Runway XL; to run our checklist and coordinate with operations to return to the gate. With the distractions of communicating with ATC; executing our pack light ON checklist; which cleared the pack light ON light; communicating to the passengers and flight attendants and coordinating with operations; at some point; I unintentionally set the parking brake. When I noticed my honest mistake; I released it. While in communication with local Maintenance on radio frequency; they told us to set again the parking brake while a gate was being coordinated for us. At that point; I began to communicate with my Dispatcher to provide an update of the situation and set a conference call with Maintenance Control. I indicated Maintenance Control that I was holding my position with the parking brake set as indicated by local Maintenance. After the call ended; local Maintenance called us and told us to release the parking brake as instructed by Maintenance Control. When a gate was available to us; I received a clearance to taxi to the gate. At that point; I realized that the airplane was not moving. I called Maintenance to come and inspect the aircraft at our position. When Maintenance arrived to inspect the aircraft; they found the number 2 tire was flat. They showed up with a tow truck to park us at the gate. The tow truck did not move the aircraft either. We coordinated to bring stairs and buses to the airplane to deplane everybody.

ATC shortly after cleared us to descend via and expect Runway Y. We made appropriate changes and briefed again for Visual to Runway Y; backed up with the ILSY. Descending through approximately 11000 ft.; ATC asked us if we wanted Runway Y when the winds favored Runway X. The winds were acceptable for Runway Y but better for Runway X so we asked for ILS to X. ATC then asked so are you requesting to fly the transition for X?"" We didn't understand the question and replied "" transition for ILS Runway X"". ATC said ok. At midfield downwind we were cleared for the visual approach to Runway X. I armed the approach and turned base leg approximately 8 miles out. We set the altitude at 6300 ft.; the altitude for the faf. The wind was quartering tailwind as we were on base. We were descending too soon and even though we didn't go below the FAF altitude; we were low. ATC advised us of an altitude alert. We said we had the terrain in sight and continued. As we approached LOC intercept I noticed the localizer did not capture the course and we flew through the course. I corrected to back across final for the Loc to capture. It did not. While this confusion was goin on the strong winds quartering behind us were blowing us through the the course and we descended towards the 6300 ft. we were farther out then I thought. We continued to fight the this approach. We never got the approach function to work. We were high on glide path as we approached the runway and unstable. I executed a go around. We were halfway through the procedure and Tower told us to go around. We had not told him that we were already going around. They vectored us around the pattern to Runway X again. We completed litanies and checklists and set up for the same approach. This time the same thing happened. The Approach would not capture. I asked the FO (First Officer) to check the ATIS to see if ILSX was out of service. It was. We were on final approximately 7 miles out on final. I turned off the Autopilot and the flight directors and hand flew a raw data Approach. Before Landing checklist was completed and we were stable before 1000 ft. Then landed and taxied to the gate.Number one factor is not reading the complete ATIS. There is no excuse for this. Second factor is ATC must have been able to see our mistakes were possibly because we were trying to fly an approach that was inop and said nothing. Third factor is FO on probation with low time/experience.All this would have been avoided if I read the ATIS completely. All this could have been avoided had ATC suggested ""localizer out of service"" when they saw we were not performing as normal. This could been prevented with a FO with a little more experience. The FO does a great job but there is no substitute for experience. In 25 years at Company I have never had to go around on a visual approach because of this type of scenario. It's humbling that making such a simple mistake can start an avalanche.""",A319 Captain reported receiving a low altitude alert from ATC after becoming low on an approach while being confused with the approach automation.

This went away within about 60 seconds but happened again about 4 more times. During these events; we noticed an IAS difference of about 5kts between the Captain and First Officer (FO) sides. I contacted dispatch and got a phone patch with Maintenance. I briefed Maintenance on the situation and they suggested we continue but monitor the instruments. During this time; we reviewed the airspeed unreliable checklist but we still were not sure who had the unreliable airspeed. After the third event; I opened the airspeed window and slowed down and then sped up about 15 knots each. We observed that the FO IAS indicator did not move but the Captain and standby indicators followed the speed changes appropriately; telling us that the FO side was unreliable. I then swapped rolls to become flying pilot and gave the radios and monitoring pilot duties to the FO. We ran the checklist for unreliable airspeed. Once we started our descent into ZZZ1; the FO airspeed indicator dropped to 45 kts and the FO altimeter stayed about 1;000 ft. higher than the Captains and the standby.

To confirm the engine had failed; the Captain increased the right thrust lever ever so slightly and noticed no response of engine indications. With the EGT redlining; the Captain suggested he needed to shut down the engine; I concurred.The Captain performed immediate action items and then called for the engine failure checklist from the QRH. Looking through the options on my EFB; I selected 'engine fire or severe damage' checklist because of the vibrations we felt; I presented the Captain with the checklist for his confirmation; and began reading.After the 4th step of the checklist; the Captain told me to continue with the checklist as he began other tasks; such as communication with ATC and beginning a mild drift down with data from the FMC. I continued with the checklist; reading and communicating every action out loud. I advised the Captain the last step was to land at the nearest suitable airport and the next checklist was the One engine inoperative landing"".In the meantime; the Captain had already [requested priority handling] with ATC and had been exploring divert airport options. He advised me that he was thinking ZZZ1 was a good option. We looked at the current weather at ZZZ1; discussed the lack of terrain and elevation; the distance from our current position; and runway/approach applicable. We agreed it was an excellent option. The Captain instructed me to resume the radios; I advised ATC of our request to land ZZZ1 to which they cleared us direct. The Captain communicated with Dispatch who agreed with the plan. The Captain then called for the. ""One Engine Inop Landing"" checklist. I ran the checklist out loud again; confirming with the Captain.The Captain then communicated with the Flight Attendants and requested that I build the approach. Once the approach was built; I briefed the Captain on the ILS X into ZZZ1; followed by the deferred descent checklist. We received vectors for the approach; the Captain made a very smooth landing; taxied to the gate; and we ran the shutdown checklist.""",B737 flight crew reported engine failure during cruise descent. Flight crew shut down engine and performed a diversion and safe landing.

Approximately 30 mins into my crew rest within the second half of the duty period I was notified to come back to the flight deck to discuss an issue with the two Relief Pilots. This was an OE (Operating Experience) Qualification Line Check segment with the student as well on rest.Upon arrival on the flight deck I was informed of a leak in progress within the center hydraulic system at a rate of 1% per minute. At the time of the initial brief on the issue the quantity was approximately 64% and showing RF with no associated EICAS messages. I confirmed the loss rate while the two Relief Pilots reviewed the Hydraulic Quantity (HYD QTY-L (C; R) QRH procedures as well as in the event of total loss of quantity the (767) HYD SYS PRESS-C (Only) procedures with me. I concurred on the their assessment of needing to address the current quantity issue and preparing for the possibility of a total loss of Center quantity into a Center Pressure loss procedure.At this time I reassumed the left control seat and initiated a SAT call with dispatch and Maintenance Control. We gave an update on current conditions related to the center system and the aircraft overall. While Maintenance Control reviewed systems affected; a fact that we the flight crew had already reviewed; the loss rate continued. it was at the point I reminded the Maintenance Control we did not have time for his review due to the continued loss of fluid and were going to initial the HYD QTY-L(C;R) procedure for the center system despite not having the associated EICAS messages to retain what fluid remained. When asking Maintenance Control if there were other options the response was they would only point us to our procedures. No additional insights/procedures were offered by Maintenance Control. During this call it was also discussed we would continue to ZZZ Airport and not request priority handling just yet given operation of 2 system and no reliance on backup systems as well as the current QRH procedure not stating to land at nearest or similar verbiage. All concurred on assessment. Although we did state we will look at advising ATC once we were into domestic/arrival airspace due to possible loss of all quantity leading into the pressure QRH.Once off the SAT link; we executed the HYD QTY - C QRH procedure down to the deferred items. At this point the center quantity was at 58%. With the aircraft in a safe configuration for continued flight with little degradation to controls etc; I stepped back to the rest seat for about an additional hour to assure some rest. Instructions were given to monitor and advise if loss resumed and I then proceeded to brief the student who was in 1A. That discussion was his qualification line check was now incomplete due to the issues at hand and he would be assuming a relief pilot seat while I assigned the right control seat to one of the Relief Pilots given extensive experience in the aircraft and the possibly of a non-standard approach to landing. I also took the opportunity to do an initial brief with our Purser and gave instructions to pull his final service earlier to assure in seats 1:30 prior to estimated arrival.Upon that brief rest culmination I returned to the flight deck to assume the control seat and also alerted the student to return. At that point we still had 58% in the center position and in safe configuration for continued flight. The two Relief Pilots cycled to the lavatory and all then took appropriate seats.The plan was brief based upon the quantity QRH to execute a 15 mile final turning on the center system per the deferred items and then extend flaps/gear on associated flap speeds to try to protect the quantity dropping to zero and getting a subsequent pressure EICAS directing us to a second; more intensive; QRH procedure. We also reviewed as a crew the HYD SYS PRESS-C QRH in expectation we may get it if quantity would not hold. The principle operational difference between the two were approachflaps and speed (normal for the QTY QRH procedure; the other F20 VREF 20 for the PRESS procedure) as well as a alternate extension for gear and the flaps/slats once in the PRESS procedure. With all in concurrence with the 'game plan' I then briefed the Purser with additional details. The FAs (Flight Attendants) at this point were complete with final service and proceeding to secure for arrival at approx 1:45 from arrival. When transferred to ZZZ Center; we advised ATC and facilitated routing followed. At this time a passenger PA was made addressing a hydraulic system deficiency and we would continue to ZZZ airport and would keep them appraised of changes. Decision was also made to deactivate WiFi leveraging the instructions posed by our  FOM but used to control information flow from aircraft that may hinder perspectives of current disposition and support of the flight and passenger.A second call was then made to Dispatch; Maintenance Control and then added the Chief Pilot prior to advising ATC. I reviewed the state of the aircraft; actions currently taken within the HYD QTY QRH and our decision to let ATC know as well as research options. We ruled out our initial alternate and looked at ZZZ1 airport (runways shorter than what we would like have seen) and then decided on ZZZ3 airport in the event our flaps/slats were not able to get to either our planned F25 approach under the QTY QRH or the F20VREF20 if needed in the PRESS QRH. There was some confusion explaining our current QRH for QTY allowed for normal operations versus the PRESS QRH dictating non-standard configurations. We settle on an estimate distance 5500-5700 needed for a F20VREF20 approach if ending up using the PRESS QRH. Although that would fit in ZZZ airport we determined less threat existed with longer surfaces in the event of other issues arising. The Chief Pilot concurred on our assessment. A final PA was made to the passengers to assure them of safe conditions and appreciation of their calmness and discretion.Once being vectored for ILS Runway XXL I noted the fuel quantity was approximately 14k. We had determined that 10.5 was our go point to ZZZ3 airport and our final reserve fuel was rounded up to 5K vs calculated 4.8k. At this point fuel was not becoming a consideration in planning and execution of procedures.At approximately 17 miles out while on an Intercept with a 'speed our discretion' clearance; F1 was called with the status page up to monitor C HYD QTY. We noted a significant hit to our QTY that was up to 63% at that time to approx 30%. With that information the decision was to drop gear while QTY and PRESS were still available. The gear did a normal extension but again took the QTY down to approx 15%. F5; F15; and F20 were all commanded while reducing airspeed. It was then; while on the localizer we saw the split flap/slat display and the system still at F1 settings. We also concurrently had the HYD PRESS C EICAS now displayed resulting in a forcing to that QRH. Actions were then taken IAW (In Accordance With) the QRH but in a hurried fashion given now descending below 3000 ft LOC and GS. Ground Prox Overide was pushed; ALT Flaps/Slats armed; and ALT selector set to F20. No response was noted for the next few minutes and a decision was made to execute a level off and missed approach.The relief pilot now operating the aircraft hand flew a level off while MCP (Mode Control Panel) was reset to disconnect from the GS/LOC. Vectors were made to the west. We re-accomplished the tasks in the PRESS QRH to no avail on movement of the flaps/slats. I then decided to take the flap handle from the F20 position; pick it up out of the detention; then re-affirm it back into the detention. It was at this point the flaps began the movement to F20. We reconfirmed speeds/gear/flaps and commenced an intercept of both LOC/GS.At around 1500 ft agl I reviewed with the right seat the F20 picture out the window differences and airspeed/float that could be expected.A normal approach to landing was made favoring a slightly low GS to attempt to maximize runway availability. A slight float occurred but touchdown was made within the zone. We executed full reverse and manual braking holding reverse longer that standard to assure stabilized tracking since nose wheel steering may be affected. We stopped just before Taxiway 1 on XXL. During the rollout the student was instructed to countdown the last 4k of runway to assure awareness and the second Relief Pilot in the middle JS (Jump Seat) was backing up awareness of systems operation. At this time fuel was approximately 10.3 that correlated with our go ZZZ3 airport decision point. Of note during the GA procedure the gear was not/could not be retracted due to the PRESS situation. Burn was above 15-16k during the re-vectoring when level. Upon stopping I held the brakes vice setting while fire rescue inspected and established communications. Decision was made to remain on runway due to brake temps possibly needing addressed by fire rescue and the possibility of not having/losing NG steering. Maximum brake temp culminated at 4.1 on wheel #1 with wheel #3 next at 3.8. No temps above those were noted. Fire rescue checked aircraft and found no fires or deflation of tires. At that point we executed the after landing but left the flaps down in the event of an evacuation being needed for unforeseen reasons. Once tug was on site we execute the tow procedure then relived control to the tug driver and pulled safely into the gate. During these process appropriate call were made to FAs; passengers; and other entities.We arrived at the gate and executed the parking checklist; executed an extensive debrief where we found our CRM to be essential to this safe outcome. I then instructed the student and non-control seat Relief Pilot to take hat and jacket and assure the passenger saw them as they deplaned.Several departments came onto aircraft for a quick inject. We then left the flight deck and debriefed the FAs thanking them for their coordination/synchronization and outstanding efforts.,B767 crew reported a gradual loss of center system hydraulic quantity during last half of cruise flight. Crew made a reduced flap setting landing at destination after executing checklist procedures and consultations with maintenance.

During climb out from ZZZ airport; I elected to turn on the weather radar as it had become dark and there were clouds building along our route and WSI had shown radar returns along our route in northern flight path pre departure. The radar failed to turn on; followed by a WXR FAIL message on the Captain side ND (Navigation Display). I double checked the settings on the Weather Radar Panel. All Weather Radar Mode Switches were set appropriately; however; there was no tilt control; nor any gain control (the Gain Uncalibrated lights remained illuminated no matter the gain position) from the Weather Radar Panel. Selected the WXR switch on the FO EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System) Control Panel and had the same WXR FAIL message. At this point; I transferred radio duties to the FO and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control via the Crew Phone. Spent a few minutes discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and we determined that the entire radar system was inoperative to include the predictive wind shear system. The dispatcher and I agreed that with the weather in the ZZZ1 airport area we needed a functioning weather radar. Dispatch advised they were going to discuss the issue with Maintenance Control and the Coordinators and would possibly have us land short of ZZZ1 and try to repair the radar before continuing the flight. Shortly thereafter; we received an ACARS advising of a return to ZZZ airport to swap aircraft. During this exchange; the FO and I noticed a mild burnt bread smell. I called back and discussed the smell with the #1 Flight Attendant to determine if we were smelling the ovens or not. After we turned the flight around; we smelled the odor again; and again; I discussed things with the flight attendants in more depth and we were able to determine the smell was not coming from the ovens or the forward galley. With this new information; the FO and I discussed the odor was possibly associated with the failed radar. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control again to advise of the development. Maintenance Control wanted to give it a 10-15 minutes and see what happened as it was intermittent. Dispatch and I agreed as we were equally split between ZZZ airport and ZZZ2 airport and could divert to either if the situation worsened. I informed Dispatch that it was my intention to advise ATC and attempt to get back to ZZZ airport. We advised ZZZ Center and proceeded direct to ZZZ airport as fast as we safely could. After advising; we noticed the odor a few more times; again highly intermittent and only lasted a few seconds. As we were landing over weight; when we talked to ZZZ approach; we elected to land the runway closest to our gate (XXR/Gate X) and requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting). Approach and landing were uneventful; ARFF met us after we cleared the runway and followed us into our gate.,Air carrier flight crew reported on departure the entire weather radar system was inoperative with weather along the route. The flight crew diverted and landed safety at the departure airport.

FO was PF and decided to level off and slow down. He communicated to ATC that we were level and possibly returning to ZZZ airport. ATC queried if I was [requesting priority handling]; which I replied affirmatively; due to smoke in cabin. ATC provided delay vectors while I coordinated with Dispatch and ZZZ Ops for a return gate. FO was setting up for a visual approach backed up by the ILS to Runway XX. When the I came back to radio COMMs; I requested ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) on the runway to check our brake temps; due to an overweight landing. We landed on Runway XX with Flaps 30 and max reverse thrust. I took control at 60 knots; stopped on the runway; as ARFF trucks approached the aircraft from all sides. Fire command advised the brakes looked hot on thermal imaging but weren't glowing. After running the brake cooling Performance Data module; we weren't required to comply with any cooling. ARFF followed us all the way to our gate. Deplaning went normally and after two aircraft swaps we completed the flight to ZZZ1 airport.,B737-700 flight crew reported that a flight attendant advised of smoke coming from a PSU (Passenger Service Unit) light during climb.  Crew returned to departure airport and made an overweight landing.

The runway was very very wet and slippery and ungrooved. I applied manual brakes and took the thrust levers out of max reverse. I started to brake and slow however the aircraft was pulling left. I told the FO I was sliding; as I was letting off the brakes to try and stop the slide and go to the end of the runway to turn off he said I have control."" He slowed the aircraft and pulled it right slightly. As I felt the aircraft slowing; I said I have it and taxied off the runway. There were no violations that occurred.""",A320 flight crew reported a loss of control when landing on a wet ungrooved runway with a slight right crosswind using maximum reverse and medium autobrakes. The flight crew resumed control of plane after the First Officer stabilized the track parallel to centerline and exited the runway normally.

Flight departed from ZZZZ normally; normal climb out and reached cruising altitude of FL 340. Flight coasted out normally and was in ETOPS airspace. At Approximately XA11 heard a bang noise followed by 2 concurrent messages. Engine 2 stall and Engine 2 high vibrations. We followed procedure and reduced thrust on number 2 engine.. messages immediately disappeared and all engine parameters were observed normal again. We called back to get our 2nd officer off break and back up into cockpit. We returned thrust lever back into the climb detent and parameters remained normal. At XA13 a second engine stall and high Vibe occurred. this time we reduced power again and parameters returned to normal however this time we kept the power reduced enough to hold altitude and we quickly discussed a possible return and decided to start our offset to 5 miles anticipating a most likely return. As I SAT called dispatch to patch into Maintenance we once again got 3 more stall indications along with high vibes followed almost instantly by a eng 2 fail. I disconnected immediately with the sat call and we proceeded to coordinated our actions. The First Officer continued to fly the airplane while quickly sending off an ACARs message and I Made a HF call to ATC requesting a 180 degree turn to ZZZZ1 airport and immediate descent to FL280. While waiting for that clearance we descended to FL280 (since we already were offset 5 miles) and proceeded to run the Eng 2 shutdown ECAM . Around that time we received CPDLC clearance to FL280 and direct ZZZ VOR. Once ECAMS were run and we were direct ZZZ VOR We discussed our next steps and Briefed Flight attendants of situation fully and gave them times to landing. We then had a good single engine altitude of FL200 and requested and descended to that as our final altitude to ZZZZ1 airport. I Then SAT called dispatch and brought everyone into the picture of what was happening as the aircraft was completely under control and a full plan had been established. Finally made a PA to the passengers about our situation being a brief and generic as possible so not to cause undesired reactions from passengers and told them we would be making a normal landing in ZZZZ1 airport. We then discussed and setup for a landing on runway XX via the ILS.. transferred controls to Myself (captain) and proceeded for what was a total of 1:40 min from incident to landing in ZZZZ1 airport. We had crash fire rescue alerted and had a normal landing and taxied to the gate. After engine shutdown I walked into the Galley and made another PA to the passengers to see how everyone was doing and after passengers were off debriefed the crew.,A321 pilot reported multiple engine stalls then engine failure.  Flight crew diverted to nearest airport and landed safely.

FO switched the SYS page where we watch the HYD A system rapidly lose fluid quantity down to approximately 70%; and then slowly bleed off down to the lowest of around 67%.  We also smelled hydraulic fluid in the flight deck.  I instruct the FO to [request priority handling] and request vectors for a return to ZZZ for visual [Runway] XXC.Above 1;000 AGL I transfer the controls and radios to the FO.  I then run the HYP Pump Low Pressure QRH; which leads me to Loss of System A QRH. I then run the Company routing landing QRH.  I message dispatch; brief the FA's (Flight Attendant); and make an address to the passengers.

Center initial response was descend and maintain FL330. [Requested priority handling] need to be below 14000 now. Took some time to get down due to MOA being hot. In the descent the R1 started to bubble and I (CA) chose to divert to ZZZ1. We landed at ZZZ1 with no fault or injuries. Taxied to the gate under our own power. After shut down and checklist. went back to check on my PAX (Passengers). The Flight crew handled the situation very professional. The company agents that met the aircraft were very professional . They still had live flights to work and were short staffed. The Company Station Manager never showed to the gate. We left over 100 pax with no lodging; food; or transportation. I (CA) Helped the PAX find hotels around the area and secured a 32 PAX bus to transport them to and from the hotel and back to the airport. Several PAX were left to sleep in the baggage claim areas with no food or proper shelter. The hotel desk had booked a hotel for the crew when we looked it up. showed permanent closed.

While silencing the horn I saw the cabin altitude approaching 10;000 ft and slowly climbing. As I had just been handed off to the next center and hadn't checked in; yet; I quickly checked in and called for an immediate descent to a lower altitude for a loss of cabin pressure while [requesting priority handling]. The FO hit LVL CHG and began a descent.  Immediately; and as the thrust levers moved to idle; the cabin pressure stabilized near 10;000 ft and began to slowly decrease toward 8500-9;000 ft. We continued to 10;000 ft to ensure the cabin altitude would not climb again.  Once there; I briefed the purser and gave a brief explanation to the pax over the PA. We had plenty of fuel and the weather was decent at ZZZ. We were on the arrival already; so with the QRC for cabin altitude warning reviewed again down to the deferred descent and landing checklists; we continued on to ZZZ uneventfully where we debriefed the mechanics who were waiting for us on arrival.The aircraft was on MEL XXXXX High Stage Valves.  Engine anti-icing was off during the pressure loss as we were not in icing conditions.,Air carrier flight crew reported loss of pressurization in descent.

I tried to confer with Dispatch and Maintenance; but the frequency the Dispatcher gave me did not work. We [requested priority handling) with Dispatch and ATC. I gave the flight attendants the briefing; and told them not to prep for evacuation; but to review all items in case another failure presented itself.  I made an announcement to the passengers quickly explaining the situation and offering reassurances. I then briefed the FO on the lack of reverser; and spoiler panels we wouldn't have and discussed how we would configure early to account for the slower flap speed. I briefed the approach; and then switched to the Pilot Flying while the FO took over the Pilot Monitoring duties. We rolled the fire truck for a precautionary measure. I flew the approach; adjusted my aim point to account for the longer landing roll. The landing and rollout were uneventful. We notified ATC after landing that the trucks were not needed. We taxied to the hard stand and accomplished the parking checklist.,A320 flight crew reported receiving a HYD Y RSVR LO LVL message during cruise.

At this time; the Captain; in the pilot monitoring (PM) role had announced that we don our masks; execute the immediate action memory items; and run the QRC per FOM guidelines. Through guidance of the QRC; we derived at the conclusion that the cabin was uncontrollable; which segues us into the QRH. In this; it guided us to commence with the cabin altitude warning/rapid decompression/[priority] decent.[Priority handling was requested] with ATC which led to vectors of our filed route clearing terrain. Due to MSA; we could not safely attain 10000; due to the mountainous terrain. ATC vectored us on a Northeasterly heading to clear terrain as it descended towards the front range. ATC was asked to notify the company of our situation as we were task saturated keeping the aircraft on a safe trajectory; while managing the cabin depressurization and attempting to communicate with the flight attendants. We notified ATC that our intent was to recover in ZZZ and shared our critical info (SOB; fuel; DG).  In the decent we were able to gain control of the cabin altitude and dial the cabin altitude back down below. 10000. There was a large issue in trying to communicate with the Flight Attendant (FA) due to the volume of the exhale function on the masks. This was far louder than the volume that voice modulation was taking place. It made it near impossible to hear the FAs and the comm radios alike.The PM addressed the passengers of the abnormality while I handled the aircraft and radios. Ultimately; we were given priority handling by ATC and flew the ILS XXL approach into ZZZ. We landed without further issue; and the Captain reached out to the chief pilot; Maintenance Control; and Dispatch per FOM protocol.,B737-800 flight crew reported loss of pressurization during descent.

Departure instructed to fly direct to ZZZZZ; climb to FL230; and 300 kts. or greater thru 10;000 ft. Climbing thru 8000 or 9000 I noticed my window; R1 had a circle of light on the upper edge; eraser head size. I mentioned; is that the sun reflecting from behind the aircraft or is that an arc? We concluded it was arcing. The arcing stopped and then not immediately but shortly after ; the window cracked from top to bottom and across. The Captain had me request a level off and vectors to run the checklist. After I completed the Window Damage-Forward checklist (cracked or shattered) the Captain transferred controls to me and he contacted Maintenance and Dispatch. We initially leveled off at 15;000 and then stepped down a few thousand feet more for traffic during a box pattern of vectors in the vicinity of the ZZZ VOR. The Captain returned from the other radio and discussed his thoughts with me and he ultimately decided the best course would be to return to ZZZ with an overweight landing. We [requested priority handling] with ATC for added safety considerations. We landed on Runway XXL and taxied to Gate XX.,Air carrier flight crew reported a cracked cockpit windshield during initial climb. Returned to departure airport uneventfully.

Just at or after rotation ECAM Eng 2 EGT High Temp. Before we could reduce thrust on Eng 2; ECAM Eng 2 EGT Over limit warning popped up. Step 1 is reduce to idle; we confirmed and reduced to idle. Step 2 is Master switch Off. I decided to not shut down engine as the EGT dropped with in limits at idle; it was operating normally and we were still very low and heavy. I [advised ATC] and requested a vector off the Dep route; set up a holding pattern at 6000 ft. Used Crew phone to discuss options with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. All agreed to keep Eng 2 operational as long as in limits; and to not delay much longer and return to base ZZZ for an over weight landing. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and coordinated Fire Rescue at Runway XY. I took over as pilot flying; made a visual approach with ILS backup; landed gently on XY approximately 22;000lbs over max. Used Medium auto brakes; turned off runway and stopped on taxiway. Fire personnel requested both engines shut down; inspected brakes and Eng 2. After cooling we got a tug tow back to gate.Obviously max performance; high hot desert; max takeoff weight all came together. Engine 2 exceeded EGT limits but by a very slim margin. Take off was with in all performance guidelines but Engine 2 was having a hot time of it.,Air carrier flight crew reported EGT exceedance on engine during takeoff climb. Returned and landed uneventfully.

Upon requesting for the next flap setting the pilot monitoring realized the flaps never transitioned from the intermediate flap setting to the requested setting; the aircraft appeared unresponsive to the flap lever movement. We initiated a go around. After leveling off to the altitude and course given by atc the pilot monitoring accomplished the appropriate checklist where thereafter the flaps appeared to be operational. We requested vectors back to the final for XR; we then got an amber indication on the fuel indictor and a rsv fuel"" indication on the fms. The PIC then [requested priority handling]. The flaps extended normally and we landed safely and taxied as normal.""",B737 First Officer reported a flap malfunction while on final approach. The crew performed a go around and regained control of the flaps; and landed safely.

I took the aircraft and attempted to use the trim and found it inop on my side as well.  We leveled at 4000 ft and organized our thoughts and duty's as to how we would continue.  We collaborated and determined I would run the abnormal checklist and he would fly and communicate with ATC.  After running the checklist we were unable to restore the system so I decided to [request priority handling] to return to ZZZ.  I also viewed this as an opportunity for the Captain in training.  I took the aircraft and radios while he gave the flight attendants a briefing; communicate with dispatch and inform the passengers of our return to ZZZ.  ATC was notified of our issue and gave us vectors to the visual approach to runway XX.  A flaps 15 landing was accomplished.  During the debrief we found it strange that dispatch responded to our ACARS message of our air return.   I subsequently called the dispatcher and he stated he never received our message.  I don't have an explanation for that.,B737 pilot reported electric trim failure inflight. Flight crew returned to departure airport.

Oil temperature and pressure indicated normal and matched #2 Engine. Initiated a descent to FL310 and since no checklist was applicable; considered diversion to ZZZ; due to possible engine seizure; and with better weather and maintenance. Notified Dispatch and Maintenance via ACARS. Further descent to FL 240; Oil quantity was down to 12%; so initiated a divert to ZZZ; notified Dispatch; the Flight Attendants (F/A's); ran the Diversion Checklist; and [requested priority handling] with ATC. Reviewed the Engine Failure and One Engine Inoperative Checklists; ran the performance data numbers for Non-normal One Engine Landing; and decided to start the APU. Briefed the approach to XXR and considered options if the engine failed at different points prior to landing. Approximately 15;000 ft; the oil quantity showed 0%; with normal oil temperature and pressure. Approaching 20NM from ZZZ; at 5000 ft above ZZZ3; the #1 Engine Oil Pressure started fluctuating below 15 and numbers turned yellow and red; the engine exceedance indicator box flashed red; so performed a shutdown of #1 Engine and placed the #1 bus on the APU generator. Configured for landing; reviewed the #1 Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist; but was rushed with time remaining to land. Considered executing a go-around; but felt we had covered everything; so decided to land. Ran the Before Landing Checklist with the performance data numbers for #1 Engine inoperative. Uneventful landing on XXR; taxied clear at 1; was checked and cleared by Fire Rescue; then taxied to Gate X. Forgot to run the Brakes Cooling Module as directed by the Non-normal Landing Page. Spoke with ZZZ Maintenance and made a write-up in the aircraft logbook. Cause: Low oil quantity #1 Engine resulting in engine failure and divert to ZZZ.Suggestion: We should have remembered to run the brakes cooling after landing by writing it down after reviewing the performance data.,B737-700 pilot crew reported an in flight engine shutdown due to a loss of oil quantity.

When given a decent the PF said Open Descent (OP DES) wouldn't engage and was using V/S. In retrospect this was the first distraction. When cleared for the approach; the approach was armed and FINAL APP Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) was cross checked. The aircraft flew through the final approach course which was the second distraction. The PF disconnected the autopilot simultaneous to ZZZ giving us a heading to reintercept. The PF over banked and our altitude began to increase. PM called 'Check Path' and path stabilized. ZZZ canceled our approach clearance; told us to level at 4;000 ft and gave us a vector for another approach. Altitude was decreasing to 3;800 which was called out by ATC as correction was being applied. Airspeed was slowing as Auto Thrust was previously disconnected with Autopilot by PF. PIC assumed PF duties. Aircraft was stabilized. We were given a decent and heading. PIC was unable to duplicate problem engaging OP DES. Once stabilized and FINAL APP was engaged and verified to be working correctly; PIC resumed PM duties followed by a normal landing.,A320 pilots reported the autopilot failed to capture the RNAV inbound course and contributed to the unstable approach.

The system shut down and the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) inhibited. We canceled the Caution; I remained flying and I had the first Officer run the ECAM. The autopilot remained engaged. The ECAM gave us the option to recover the system if the overheat extinguished. It did after about 10-15 minutes and we recovered the system and then reviewed the Flight Manual (FM) for any additional info. We then contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control for their recommendations. We all agreed that we could continue to ZZZ1; however I did say if the overheat returned we would return to ZZZ. All good. After about another 10-15 mins; the overheat ECAM returned. We got clearance to return to ZZZ; [requested priority handling] and then sent an ACARS message to Dispatch that we [requested priority handling] and were returning to ZZZ. We also requested that equipment be standing by and a tow vehicle if we had to land with the system out to tow us to the gate. I then transferred flying duties to the First Officer as I briefed the Purser and passengers. I gave the purser my briefing and not to prep for evac. I did tell her we may have to tow to the gate. Just prior to descent; the overheat condition stopped. We both agreed that we should leave the system off until we needed it for landing. We repowered it on the base leg and landed with full hydraulics. After landing; we cleared the runway and the commander requested that we stop for an exterior inspection. All was good and we taxied to the gate for a normal deplaning. I felt our training kicked in and was a great help. We communicated with all parties and got everyone on board for a safe return. Well done by all involved.,A319 Captain reported a hydraulic system malfunction during cruise flight that required a diversion to the nearest suitable airport.

I immediately turned off the L1 windshield heat switch; began to slow to 250 KIAS from the ATC assigned 300 KIAS and asked the FO to inform ATC.  I then asked him to run the Window Damage procedure.  We ran that procedure to completion and continued inbound to ZZZ.  ATC (ZZZ Center) asked if we were declaring an emergency to which I declined.  I felt since the airplane was flying normally and this was a crack in the outer pane of the windshield we did not need assistance.  Upon check-in with approach; they had [given priority handling] us.  The fire trucks were waiting for our arrival.  After an uneventful landing we taxied in with the emergency vehicles following.Because of the event; they turned us west on [taxiway] 1 to taxi away from the normal flow of traffic.  After we declined inspection by the fire trucks; we were given taxi instruction [taxiway] 2; 3; 4; and 5 to the gate.  I misunderstood and taxied [taxiway] 2; 3 thinking we were to go to gate X and join the normal sequence of traffic into the ramp.   As we arrived at the gate; ZZZ ground call and provided a phone number for the TRACON.  They had a few question about whether there were injuries and the nature of the issue.  I spoke to the Ops Manager and answered the questions.  The ELB (Electronic Log Book) was entered; maintenance; manager and an Inflight Supervisor met us at the gate. I also made a PA upon arrival to the pax (passengers) to communicate why emergency vehicles had met us and followed us to the gate.,B737 Captain reported a cracked L1 cockpit window during descent and a taxi clearance deviation once on the ground.

I continued to fly the STAR into ZZZ while directing the First Officer (FO) to run the non normal checklists. While configuring for the approach for the ILS XXR I slowed down to configure and eventually called for gear down and flaps 15. It was then that I noticed no flaps had extended. I immediately directed a go-around. While on the go-around to 5;000 feet we requested delay vectors and [requested priority handling]. We were given holding instructions at ZZZ VOR but could not get it into the box so we continued with delay vectors. Once stabilized at 5;000 feet I gave the aircraft to the FO and took a moment to review what we had and what he had done. I was in the process of looking for the appropriate flap non normal procedure when I happened to pull up the hydraulic system page and noticed that we had lost the B hydraulic system. It was during this time that I managed to get a note off to Dispatch about the problem and that we had [requested priority handling]. I was also able to finally talk to the flight attendants and the make a quick PA to the people. I ran the loss of B Hyd checklist and reviewed this with the FO.Once he was comfortable with the remainder of the checklist; we swapped controls and requested the ILS to XXC at ZZZ. Approach had been calling the ceilings variable between 250 to 400 feet. I hand flew this approach due to another system deferral. We were able to extend the flaps using the Alternate Flap master switch and landed uneventfully on XXC. I cleared the runway at Taxiway 1 then stopped so the emergency vehicles could look us over. We were towed to Gate XX after being cleared by ZZZ fire rescue.We were dispatched with an FMC inop with low ceilings expected in ZZZ. Our alternate was ZZZ1; which was legal but would deteriorate later in the day. We had the initial problem in a critical phase of flight and had fuel on board of 10.4 when we [requested priority handling] with a bingo of 7.5 to get to ZZZ1. I wanted to get the checklist completed and shoot an approach while we still had alternate fuel and options.,B737 flight crew reported multiple equipment failures during descent to land.

I went to check and found what appeared to be hydraulic fluid wearing from the actuators.  A ELB entry was made.  Local maintence had us pressurize the system and operate the roll input.  About 10-15 full deflection inputs were made and the writeup was cleared.  (A system hydraulic level was slightly lower than B.  A had about 83% vs B at 90%.)Normal F25 takeoff was performed; with aircraft wt about 150;000#.  On climb out noticed the aircraft had a slight tendency to roll left.  There as a noticeable dead spot between 2 units left of top to top on the yoke; which had very little roll to the aircraft.  Forces past top to the right were stiff and noticeably more force than normal was required to get the aircraft to respond.Climb out and initial cruise were performed in the center of airspeed window.  Pitch and rudder inputs/ responses were normal.Decision was made to proceed to ZZZZ vs ZZZZ1 due to runway length; aircraft weight; and airport resources. [Priority handling requested] with ZZZ Center.  Dispatch was contacted via SATCOM and a phone patch to Maintenance Control was initiated.  The situation was discussed; and I told Dispatch that we would contact them shortly to discuss the plan of action with the Chief Pilot.  The Chief Pilot was contacted about 30 minutes after takeoff and we coordinated our game plan to continue to ZZZZ.The F/O and I discussed the checklist; passenger instruction; F/A awareness; and course of action into ZZZZ.The F/As were to remain seated except to prepare the cabin for arrival. A briefing was given first on the intercom and later in person prior to descent.   No passenger services were to be performed.  Passengers were seated except for a 15 minute period prior to top of descent for lavatory usage.RNAV was to be performed to [Runway] XXL as the ILS was OTS.  XXL was chosen due to runway length.  The field was sighted 40 miles out.  Being restricted to the RNAV was the only quandary we had as the FM directed A/P and A/T off directly contradicts the FM guidance on A/P usage during a NP (non-precision) approach.  Fortunately ZZZZ was VMC that evening. Flap 15 landing was performed.  Right roll past center was noticeably more difficult at the slower speeds.Normal touchdown and rollout.ZZZZ aircraft rescue and firefighting directed us to stop on the runway for an aircraft inspection.  Which seemed at the time silly as the situation involved a flight control issue and normal taxiing was noted.Overall the situation went very well with coordination of ATC; Company operations in ZZZ; and on ZZZZ.,B737 Captain reported on climb out the aircraft had a left rolling tendency and the yoke had several dead spots requiring more than normal control forces to get aircraft to respond. Flight crew diverted and completed a normal landing.

Within 10 seconds; we heard a loud bang and observed the window completely shattering the outside pane. I checked pressurization and it seemed normal; but a portion of the outer pane was missing. We promptly followed and completed the [priority handling] procedure in the Flight Manual (FM) and I informed dispatch with the Maintenance Control on the line. We collectively agreed it was wise to return to ZZZZ; [requesting priority handling]. We adjusted our course away from the present track; coordinating with ZZZZ1 to proceed towards ZZZZ2 FIR. After receiving clearance; we followed ATC instructions. Utilizing the diversion guide from the FM; we briefed the lead Flight Attendant (FA) with the necessary information and informed passengers of our situation and planned actions. Subsequently; after discussing with the flight crew; we elevated our condition to a [priority handling] aircraft status to prepare for any further unforeseen events. The remainder of the flight proceeded without incident; and we safely landed back at ZZZZ.,B767 flight crew reported the outer pane of the First Officer's windscreen shattered in cruise.

The Captain said that he was going to maintain the present heading so that we can figure out the flight control problem. A couple of minutes later; the aircraft was under control and Captain  handed me over the control to get my opinion on it. As he described; I felt the no resistance as I steer the control wheel to the left; but much more resistance as I steer to the right. From center position to about 3 units to the left; there was no force at all where as center to 1 unit right and beyond; there was much force that I needed to apply much strength to override it and steer. We [requested priority handling]; Captain and I ran through the Jammed/ Restricted Flight Control Checklist. After the checklist; we re-engaged the autopilot A to reduce workload but was not able to. The autopilot B was engaged instead. Captain took the control of the aircraft and landed at ZZZ safely. Prior to the flight; Captain  and I found hydraulic fluid in the left main gear compartment. The Maintenance took action and found out that it was not a leakage. It is uncertain this is linked with restricted flight control.,B737 First Officer reported restricted and jammed flight controls during climb out.

Aircraft was pressurizing normally. Started non normal checklist and item on checklist was to depressurize aircraft; we stopped climb at 8000 ft and completed non normal checklist. Then completed the overweight landing checklist with associated performance calculations. Decision was made to land back at ZZZ with overweight landing as all conditions were met to be able to do so. Then completed the non routine landing checklist and briefed the Dispatcher; Flight Attendants; and Passengers. [Priority was requested] to have fire trucks available as we would be overweight and high energy landing. Landing was made using ILS XXL flaps 25 auto brakes 3 at about 616;000 lbs. and 150;000 lbs of fuel. Landing was soft touchdown and nominal braking bringing aircraft to stop on runway to give Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) a chance to inspect brake and tire conditions. Everything was good and taxied to gate without issue. Log book entry's made for overweight landing and aft cargo door indication.Cause - Cargo door fault.Suggestion - Better Maintenance.,B777-300 flight crew reported on departure they received an aft cargo door indication.  Flight crew decided to return to the departure airport and made a successful overweight landing.

The Captain stated that the APU was just turned on. At boarding we contacted the Purser/Captain on the ground; a passenger was complaining that the area was unbearably warm in the area between Row XX - YY. After takeoff; the area did not cool off as expected so I spoke with Captain about angry passengers in Seats XXC; XYC and XZA. He told me that he would call Dispatch to inquire what to do about proceeding to ZZZZ. We continued with our inflight service. About halfway into the service the crew bunk smoke detectors at 3L and 3R went off. A Flight Attendant inspected the crew bunks at Door 3L and 3R and found no signs of fire while other flight attendants called Purser and Captain. Business class had a very strong and distinct bandage smell or dirty gym sock smell. The smell wasn't present in coach until final descent and was through the whole aircraft. I developed watery eyes; congestion; and tightness in my chest. We returned to ZZZ and arrived at the gate with personnel meeting the plane. At the Captain's advisement the flight attendants sought medical attention.,Air carrier Flight Attendant reported the cabin was uncomfortably warm in flight. The smoke detectors went off; a strong odor filled the aircraft; and the flight crew performed an air turnback.

The fire indicators had been going on and off in the flight deck for the cargo which initiated setting off the extinguishers and other cooling measures on the aircraft. The IFE (In Flight Entertainment) and other electronic controls were not working due to overheating. We were told there was a possibility of a ditching as the weather was too poor in ZZZZ1 to land there and they weren't sure what our options were. Meanwhile the galley was secured and power turned off. It was then decided we were to land in ZZZZ as a precautionary landing. The pilots informed the passengers that there was signs of smoke in the cargo and we would be diverting to ZZZZ and landing in 25 minutes. The crew prepares the cabin for landing as usual and took our jump seats. Upon landing [priority handling] vehicles were there and inspected the aircraft for probably a half hour. I smelled smoke but later was informed it could have been from the cargo extinguishers. They couldn't detect any heat from the outside so the aircraft was deemed unnecessary to evacuate. Then we parked the aircraft and had to wait about another half hour for any busses to arrive to deplane the passengers cabin by cabin to get in the busses. That took probably an hour. Then the crew deplaned. We sat on the bus for probably another half hour and firefighters came on saying they had only found evidence of condensation at that point; no fire. We were told we would not be getting back on that aircraft and our new plan was to lay over for the day and take the passengers in a new plane to ZZZZ2 at XA:00 pm; lay over for 28 hours and ZZZZ3 back to ZZZ (and they reflected that). Customs agents weren't there quite yet so the customs process took a very long time. I believe we got to the airport hotel at XB:45am. We were given minimum rest. We were told pickup was XB:30pm. There were very few food options around. I didn't hear anything from anyone until about XB:15pm the purser called my room informing me we were staying the night and leaving in the morning and he would give me more info shortly. 10 min later the FO called my room and said we were leaving tonight and come downstairs asap. At this time I found out the passengers had been flown to ZZZ1 earlier in the day in a plane flown in from ZZZ1. We all went to the airport where customs had gone home so we had to be escorted through the airport and then driven 4 at a time to the plane where maintenance was still working and they were still taking the cargo off. I was not asked if I was willing to work the original plane we had flown in. During that time a cargo pod of okra was taken out of cargo that was smoking and smoldering and hot to the touch. The pilot went out to investigate but it had been taken away. After probably an hour and a half on the aircraft I think we took off for ZZZ1 around XC:30 in the morning. Landed in ZZZ1 around XE:30 or XF:00 am where we went through customs and went to the hotel shuttle area to then be told there weren't enough rooms at the hotel so the captain called hotel limo and we split into two groups. We had minimum rest. At XE:00 pm we took the shuttle to ZZZ1 and we deadheaded back to ZZZ. There was someone from flight service who met the plane. Other than that I have never been called by the company or union to be checked in with.,Air carrier flight attendant reported the flight attendant crew was informed by the pilots of a possible cargo fire. Flight crew diverted and landed safely.

Then we performed the ECAM actions; [advised ATC] and we both decided to divert to ZZZ1. We had no indication of smoke or fumes inside the cockpit nor the cabin. As soon as we turned to ZZZ1 the ECAM message disappeared and since we were close to initiating the descent to ZZZ we decided to cancel the [priority handling] and continue to ZZZ. Later; during the descent to ZZZ and approximately 10 minutes after the indication went out; we had the ECAM avionics smoke message again. [Requested priority handling] one more time; running the ECAM and flying fast to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. After an assessment we decided to continue to ZZZ. The Captain informed the company; flight attendants (FAs) and the passengers of the situation. Once on ground a firefighter team checked the aircraft for any smoke indication; the passengers were well aware of what was happening. After the inspection we continued to the assigned parking spot; deplaning the aircraft normally. Ground personnel also checked the avionics compartment. This was the last flight as part of my IOE.,A320 pilot reported an avionics smoke ECAM prior to descent extinguished but returned later as flight continued to destination.

Near XA15 during conversation with the captain; I mentioned feeling pressure changes in my ears and noticed the pressure gauge showed the cabin descending at a rate of around 300 feet per minute while we were still mostly maintaining a cabin altitude of ~8000 ft. I thought this could just be an indication error in the analog gauge. However about 15 minutes later we received several EICAS caution alerts in rapid succession. Within a few seconds I saw alerts for the aft bulk cargo door; forward cargo door and emergency doors not being properly secured. Then there were a series of aural alerts and several more EICAS cautions changing and happening too quickly to remember. My immediate thought was that a rapid decompression was imminent and wanted to descend - so we asked the flight attendants to take their jumpseats. It was unclear which checklist to run given the multiple cautions but I decided on the emergency doors checklist since that was the alert that I noticed for the longest time; while the captain referenced the aft bulk cargo checklist. We were at the same time observing pressure bumps and quick changes in the pressure gauges. Both decision trees led us to descending to 14;000 ft and a similar resolution so we asked for and received vectors from ZZZZ control for the descent and [requested priority handling]. At some point during the descent the caution messages disappeared and didn't return for the remainder of the flight. In consultation with dispatch we decided to divert to ZZZZ [airport]; had the 3rd pilot return to the right seat and briefed the flight attendants on the plan. We completed the abnormal checklist items and the remainder of the flight and approach was uneventful. After landing the flight attendants in the aft galley informed us that door 2L was extremely loud during the approach.,Air carrier First Officer reported during cruise flight the aircraft began to depressurize. Various cargo ECIAS messages appeared causing a divert to a nearby airport.

We had cargo door open front and rear; emergency door warning at first. I told the FO to maintain flight path and fly the airplane.  The cabin started climbing and then multiple EICAS alerts started again. Door lights were lit up on the overhead panel and at one point there were more EICAS messages than I could count.  I [advised ATC] and we had the other fo come back from crew rest.  I performed the checklist for the first item which was the cargo doors. I told ATC we needed to descend to 14;000 and for a vector off the airway (at 14;000 the cabin pressure stabilized and there was no need to go to 10;000). I checked the grid altitudes in our area and we were on a safe track. I called dispatch and informed the what was going on and the patched in Maintenance Control. The FO was wanting to start another checklist and I told him to keep flying the airplane.  We didn't need two people running checklists and no one flying.  It took a while to get the other FO in as there were so many things happening that we couldn't take time to let them in. The purser called and said door 2L was making a horrendous noise. I had the Relief Pilot call the purser and make a PA.  Purser reported that the PA was very weak; so we had them talk to the passengers.  I conferred with dispatch to go to ZZZZ [airport] and ZZZZ1 [airport] as a back up to that if needed. I coordinated with dispatch to get our info to ops in ZZZZ. Dispatch was very helpful and a huge asset to us. I talked to the purser and gave them the briefing info. We then did a thorough approach brief and discussed our threats and flight path forward.  We landed 7;000 pounds over max landing; which we thoroughly briefed.  We insured all checklists we complete and had a normal approach and landing.,B767 flight crew reported several indications of open doors and pressurization failure resulting in a diversion.

We continued climb; followed procedures; shut the #2 engine down [requested priority handling] and returned to land using the RNAV Y approach to Runway XXC. This event led to an overweight landing and high brake temperatures.This situation was caused by sending an aircraft on a flight with maximum passengers; heavy fuel load and TOGA power; APU ON performance. The strain on the engines caused the overtemp.I believe airplanes that are susceptible to exceeding their EGT limits should be flown on shorter segments with light takeoff weights that would allow for a FLEX performance. This would create a wider margin between engine temp and MAX EGT limit.,A321 pilot reported on initial climb they received an EGT LIMIT message. Flight crew shut down the number two engine and returned to the airport.

The fire extinguishers were deployed below; which the crew could hear in the front of the cabin. Due to these cooling measures; the IFE (In-flight Entertainment) overheat warning light came on; and we soon lost the IFE system and WIFI.  We began to prepare the cabin; shutting everything down in the galleys; all while trying not to alarm the passengers. While waiting for more information from the cockpit; we began looking up ditching procedures in our manuals to mentally prepare. Pilots informed us we were diverting to ZZZZ1 with a precautionary landing. On descent; the plane could not fuel properly. It was communicated to be prepared to look for any smoke or fire upon landing; and possibly evacuate by slides. Upon landing we were met by vehicles who inspected the aircraft before we could deplane. The deplaning procedure was to be with the XL door deplaning in sections by ramp stand; while all of the crew manned our doors in the armed position. It took hours to get buses; deplane; and go through customs with all our passengers.  Many of our passengers were asking us what to do; as the company had communicated nothing to them. While all together; we were told by ops that we would continue on to ZZZZ that evening with the passengers; on a new aircraft; have a 28 hour layover; and deadhead back. This was agreed upon as we all had time to decompress; rest; and felt safe on a different aircraft. We were given a minimum rest day layover; with our schedule showing we were continuing on to ZZZZ that evening.  There was no communication from the company; until a hour before pick up; when our schedule changed to ferry the same aircraft to ZZZ1 instead of continuing to ZZZZ. This was not the agreed to decision. After being rushed to the aircraft; we then sat for roughly three hours; as the plane was not ready to leave. Time that should have been spent in our hotel rooms; decompressing from such a traumatic experience. Coincidentally; because we were on the aircraft; we were present when cargo containing it taken off that was still smoking; and hot to the touch; 18 hours or so after the fire was first detected. The cargo was carted off with no further inspection of the heat and smoke source. This is incredibly unsettling. When we reached ZZZ1 at XA:15 in the morning; we did not have hotel rooms; and were once again given a minimum rest layover. At no point did the company reach out to me; there was no debrief; and to my knowledge there was no follow up on the cargo. Suggestion: Please consider having Airlines report the reason for any and all diversions; complete with inspections. Furthermore; if a fire extinguisher is deployed; please ensure reports and investigations are mandatory. The company completely dismissed us; and we have not heard anything on an investigation into the cause and findings in the cargo. Additionally; please consider mandating crews are removed from flights after [priority handling] and diversions for mental health and rest.,Cabin crew flying on a B777 aircraft reported that the aircraft had a cargo fire and diverted.

A few minutes later; trying to control the cabin; per QRC; and setting up a diversion to ZZZ [airport]; as we were 90 miles NE of ZZZ. Suddenly; the ALT Warning Red Illumination light flashed. Both the Captain and I donned our masks and established Crew communication. The Captain notified ATC he was descending. I began running checklist; setting up the FMC and doing all I could to get set up for the ILS [runway] XXL and make the Captain's job easier as he was flying. I don't quite remember a lot of details when we started our descent; but ATC did [provide priority handling] for us. I ran all checklists. We did not drop Cabin masks; because there was still oxygen in the cabin. Crew F/As (Flight Attendants) all did a phenomenal job as the aircraft safely reached ZZZ.Suggestions: Not fly with only one Pressurization Controller .,B737 flight crew reported aircraft MEL'd with one operational pressurization controller which failed resulted in a divert and an overweight landing.

We ran the Electric Drive QRH; which instructed us to disconnect the #2 Drive and start the APU and connect it to the affected side. About 10-15 minutes later the APU had a fault and shut down. We re-ran the drive QRH; which instructed us to land at the nearest suitable airport due the single power source condition. After that; we ran the APU fault QRH. At this time; we were about 140 NM from ZZZ; and we determined that was our nearest suitable because we were still in cruise at FL380. We [requested priority handling] and requested direct to ZZZ.  ATC gave us direct; and we relayed our Souls on Board and fuel status. I sent a message to Dispatch about our status and that we were continuing to ZZZ. I then informed the Flight Attendants of our status and had them clean up early. I didn't inform the Passengers about our #1 Generator status after discussing it with my FO and Jumpseater. We were all in agreement that we shouldn't cause any extra stress for the Passengers. The weather was VFR in ZZZ; and we were also very busy coordinating with ATC. The rest of the flight was uneventful.,B737 Captain reported a failure of the #2 Generator Drive; followed by an APU auto-shutdown due to a fault. Flight continued to destination.

The QRH Checklist was completed; which directed us to disconnect the drive then start the APU. The APU was started; and the generator connected to the #2 side. After about 10-15 minutes; the APU failed; leaving us with one electrical generator. We reran the checklist for the Drive light without an operable APU. This directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. The Crew; including a Company FO in the jumpseat; discussed and all agreed that ZZZ was the nearest suitable airport as we were only 140 miles out. We [requested priority handling] for a direct flight path to ZZZ. After this; we ran the APU fault QRH. The Captain briefed the Flight Attendants and we all agreed there was no need to brief the Passengers. We decided that would create unnecessary stress on the Passengers. The Captain informed Dispatch of the situation as well. We continued to ZZZ which was VFR at the time. We landed without any further issues. The airport did dispatch the emergency vehicles. We did not request this and did not need any further assistance from them. This was an aircraft malfunction and was handled per standards and procedures. I don't believe there is much else that can be done to prevent this from occurring again. It happens and I believe we are trained properly to handle these situations.,B737 First Officer reported a generator drive malfunction during cruise. The crew continued to the destination; which was the nearest suitable airport; and landed.

Aircraft X had previously flown in the morning; but it was the first flight on the aircraft for us. We started #2 and single engine taxied to Runway XX. We started #1 and had our two-minute warm up requirement. This takeoff was planned with Windshear Advisories in effect and was a max thrust takeoff at around 102.5 N1. Takeoff was uneventful. About 25 to 30 minutes after departure climbing through FL260 we experienced a #2 engine failure. First Officer was the Pilot Flying and I; Captain; was the Pilot Monitoring at the time of the occurrence. The #2 Engine banged loudly followed by vibrations. I quickly scanned our engine gauges and observed a red EGT indication and Engine Failure Alert on the #2 Engine. I directed FO to continue flying while I further analyzed situation and announced the condition and appropriate QRC. Due to the loud bang and vibrations as well as red EGT digital readout; I suspected that we had severe engine damage. I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center; briefly described our situation; and requested them to stand by. We performed and completed the QRC Severe Engine Damage;"" as trained. We did not have a fire indication or overheat so we did not fire the bottles. At that time; I questioned the severe damage; due to the fact that we had N1 and N2. My initial assessment was that it was severe; so I proceeded with the most conservative option. We then proceeded to the QRH. We; at that point; assessed our position and diversion plan and determined that ZZZ was the nearest and most suitable airport with weather and NOTAMs.I requested delayed vectors to continue our preparations and checklists. ATC began to vector us (heading and altitude) for landing at ZZZ. Once we completed the QRH critical items; FO and I transferred controls and I became the Pilot Flying; FO the Pilot Monitoring. FO did an exceptional job completing the remaining QRH Items and required performance data for the diversion preparation and brake cool module. During the vectors; ATC brought us parallel to our final approach course with anticipation of vectoring us around until we were ready. This caused the FMC course to dump the approach. We noticed this and had to reload and re-brief the approach adding additional work and possibility of errors. FO did a great job in quickly reprograming and verifying its accuracy. Once our checklists were completed and all notifications to Flight Attendants; Dispatch and Passengers were completed we advised ATC that we were prepared to continue for Single Engine landing in ZZZ; with emergency vehicles standing by. We were at this time in contact with ZZZ Tower; who vectored us very close to VFR traffic in the area. This caused a TA. Knowing that I would not receive RA guidance (QRH step); I elected to react prior to ATC instructions and immediately deviated left of instructed heading to avoid traffic that was climbing and indicated 700 ft. below us. FO quickly advised Tower of our new heading in which ATC had no problem with. We were re-vectored to final and had an uneventful landing on Runway YY. We exited and requested Fire Assistance to walk around our aircraft and assess any other conditions that we may not be aware of. We got the ""All clear"" and we parked uneventfully at the gate in ZZZ. Maintenance Logbook entries were completed.""",B737-800 flight crew reported engine failure during climb.

We had just begun our descent with all briefings and checklists completed. Between 30 and 29;000 feet I felt and heard a small jolt. I thought the Captain had dropped a water bottle on the floor; but I also felt almost imperceptible yaw. We immediately looked at the ECAM and saw that engine 2 had automatically reduced itself to idle; with all other parameters normal at that instant. However; this was quickly accompanied by ENG 2 Stall ECAM. The Captain immediately assigned me to continue flying duties while he completed the ECAM. Because the EGT was climbing rapidly and out of limits; we followed ECAM procedures to shut down engine 2. [Requested priority handling] and we were cleared directly to the airport. The Captain checked FM non-normals for ENG 2 Stall and reviewed notes warnings and cautions. He then notified Dispatch; completed a briefing with the flight attendants; and made a passenger PA. After a discussion with the Captain; we decided that he would be pilot flying for the landing. We were set up originally to land on runway XL; however they offered us landing on XX to expedite our arrival. We accepted this; and I verified on the landing distance non-normals table that this would be acceptable with the wind component. We were cleared directly to a fix on the ILS; which we briefed. However after arming the approach; it became clear to me that the localizer was not reliable. I loaded the RNAV XX in the box to give the Captain backup guidance; although we were visual with the runway at this time. We were cleared for a visual approach. I queried ATC if the localizer was active for XX; and they turned it on. After receiving positive identification; I reloaded the ILS and used this to backup the visual approach. After landing; we exited the runway and asked airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) to inspect the number 2 engine for anomalies. After receiving word that nothing was out of the ordinary; the Captain made a PA to the passengers; and we taxied to the gate.,A320 First Officer reported landing safely after the in flight shutdown of the number 2 engine.

We immediately got a Master Caution with both respective cowl valve lights illuminating. We ran the respective QRH Checklist. We notified Dispatch that suggested that because of the weather and precipitation enroute a return to the field (ZZZ) was the best course of action. We [requested priority handling]; notified ATC and Dispatch of an overweight landing condition when returning to the field. All subsequent checklists; to include the overweight landing and non routine landing considerations were adhered to. Landed back in ZZZ without any further issues Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles inspected the aircraft and we subsequently taxied back to the gate without issues.

At XA:57 central the pilots called with brief info for a normal landing in ZZZ. Once we landed at XB:34 the pilots informed us that there was an oil fault with that engine and there would be another plane coming for the passengers to go to ZZZ1. They ZZZ airport provided a shuttle bus to transport passengers from the aircraft to the terminal. All passengers were informed to take all their belongings with them. All passengers were deplaned at XC:58. All passengers and crew were safe and unharmed.,B737 flight attendants reported being alerted to an engine shutdown which resulted in priority diversion to a safe landing.

This occurred at about XA:00am. We flew ZZZ-ZZZ1 and this was the return flight. While tracking localizer inbound to Runway XXC into ZZZ; I called for flaps 2. At that time we received a master caution; with associated single chime and ECAM. Flight Control (F/CTL) Flaps Locked; Alignment Fault. We executed a successful go-around. We [requested priority].I transferred controls and radios to the First Officer (FO). I coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The FO flew delay vectors; so we could run the checklist.We completed a safe landing and followed SOP and QRH procedures.,A320 flight crew reported during final approach they selected flaps 2 and received a master caution ECAM for a flight control fault /flap locked message.

I stated continue. Shortly after rotation; FO Noticed and stated airspeed wasn't right. I saw his airspeed was indicating approximately 120kts and rolling back. I did a crosscheck against both my airspeed and the standby instruments. Noticed the standby speed tape was also at approximately 120kts and rolling back. My airspeed indications were increasing and matching ground speed. I took control of the aircraft and pitched 10* and n1 80%. Airspeed unreliable memory items were actioned. The FO then sourced the QRC FOR AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE. At approximately 1500 ft. we [requested priority handling] with Tower and requested vectors for the ILS XXL. We then went to the FM (Flight Manual) Airspeed unreliable check list.  Climbed to 5000 ft. per ATC.  Upon level off noticed FOs airspeed around 110kts and altimeter reading 300-400 high. Standby speed indicating 60kts. Verified my airspeed with a crosscheck of both ground speed and ATC. Sent a diversion report to dispatch and briefed the Flight Attendants.  We then re-recruised the aircraft and performed the descent checklist; followed by landing checklist. On final approach noticed standby airspeed at 0kts and FOs IAS at 60kts. Landed ZZZ [airport] ILS XXL.Upon arrival at the gate we did a parking checklist. We were then meet by a mechanic and discussed our situation. He mentioned that there were a lot of bugs flying around; today. I then tried to enter the manual code for AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE; however; I kept receiving a fault message. I then followed up with dispatch and the Chief Pilot.  After consultation with the Chief Pilot; we were informed that there would be a crew swap. We remained on the aircraft for approximately 30-45 minutes. During; this time we kept the passengers apprised of the situation; and that a new crew was inbound to take the flight to ZZZZ [airport] in approximately 1-1 1/2 hours. Upon leaving the aircraft I went outside to talk with the mechanics and inform them I was unable to enter a manual code. I used one of the mechanic's tablet and wrote up; airspeed unreliable; FOs and standby indicator.,B737-800 flight crew reported unreliable airspeed indications on First Officer's and standby indicator during initial climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed.

This ECAM requires shutting down the ENG. We confirmed terrain clearance and entered holding at ZZZ [VOR]. FA's; PAX; Dispatch and ATC were notified.  Coordinated for vectors to RWY XXR. ECAM and ENG shutdown was accomplished during descent. Uneventful landing.    Cause: Old ENG with a TOGA takeoff on a hot day in ZZZ.  Solution: Send older aircraft to cooler climates.,A321 Captain reported receiving an alert message of #2 engine EGT limit exceedance during initial climb.

The Master Caution was reset and the Captain began the QRH procedures. I was PF so I continued as PF and the Captain transferred ATC communications to me. The QRH procedure actioned first was the SOURCE OFF (Max) procedure. The checklist was accomplished and the decision tree led to a land at nearest suitable airport due to the SOURCE OFF light remaining illuminated after the APU was started. The QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) procedure for DRIVE light was accomplished next. During this time we asked ATC to keep us with ZZZ TRACON while we communicated with Dispatch.  We stopped the climb at 15000. After receiving a ACARS response from Dispatch that they would notify ZZZ Operations and Maintenance Control of a return to field we asked for lower to help burn fuel for an Overweight landing. The Captain reviewed verbally the FOM (Flight Operation Manual) guidance on overweight landing and we decided that it could be accomplished safely.  We continued with delay vectoring from ATC to review our plan. [Requested priority handling]. A normal approach and landing were accomplished to RWY XXL. We used FM (Flight Manual) performance numbers for MAX 9 landing distance flaps 40 and also sent for ACARS landing data since this was NOT an abnormal landing configuration.  Normal touchdown and rollout with autobrakes 2.  Taxi to gate X.  ELB (Electronic Logbook) entries were made and we were met by Maintenance.,B737 MAX 9 flight crew reported the Master Caution light illuminated and an electrical system annunciation displayed during departure climb.

As we were approaching FL270 a sudden a simultaneous illumination of the red Cabin Altitude light and Horn sounded. My reaction was to execute the cabin rapid depressurization memory items followed by the reading of our QRH. The accomplishment of the immediate memory items by the Captain followed by the QRH read by First Officer in concurrence with the Captain. For us our priority was to aviate; navigate and then communicate. Because of the recognition of loss of pressurization and the constant sounding of the Horn and the attempt to control the cabin pressure by closing the outflow valve. We requested a lower altitude; however; due to the loud noises in the cabin and the use of oxygen mask; although we as crew had already established communications. The ATC  Controller couldn't hear our request for lower altitude. Which led her to [request priority handling] for us. To which we agreed and at the same time we continued our descend to 10;000FT as per the QRH. Upon reaching 10;000FT; the horn stopped sounding and the FO removed his oxygen mask first and everything was under control. Cause: The sudden Lost of the Left Pack.Suggestions: The good monitoring and maintenance of the aircraft's pressurization system.,B737 Captain reported failure of the left pack and loss of pressurization during cruise descent. Flight crew performed rapid descent and continued flight.

We performed the ECAM actions. As expected; the ECAM switched from LO LVL to LO PR. Since there was no applicable QRH; we went through the manual procedure (HYD Y RSVR LO LVL; since that was the main/root issue). The manual pointed out the possibility of losing yellow accumulator pressure; so we started a timer (as per the manual procedure) to check the accumulator pressure later. It turned out that the accumulator was holding pressure normally. The manual procedure also stated there was a possibility of fuel consumption increased; if the spoiler's panel lost (2 and 4) were not completely retracted. On the F/CTLs synoptic page; the depiction indicated that the failed panels were in the completely retracted position and there was no 'FUEL CONSUMPT INCRSD' in the ECAM Status; but we wanted to be sure. We called the Flight Attendant (who was already aware of the issue since she called us to report service was done) and asked if they could verify if the spoilers were flush. Because they were not assertive in their answer; we decided that I should go back to the cabin and verify it. I did it and we ruled out the fuel consumption increase/fuel penalty factor. We kept track of the fuel consumption fix by fix and it was consistent with the flight release. We ran landing performance numbers on our EFB and the results were compatible with landing in ZZZ [airport]. We then decided to continue the flight to destination and communicated the issue and the decision to Dispatch; asking them to make arrangements for our tow to the gate. The captain made a PA to the passengers letting them know we would have to be towed to the gate after landing. Meanwhile; we started to get repetitive ECAM alerts (HYD Y RSVR LO LVL); so we decided to cancel it. Later on the flight; we decided to call dispatch and ask for ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) services to be standing by; just as a precaution for the (remote) possibility of fire from dripping hydraulic fluid onto the hot brakes. We descended to ZZZ and landed safely; stopping on the runway. We got towed into the gate uneventfully.,A320 Captain reported receiving a hydraulic fluid low level message during climb. Flight returned to departure airport and aircraft was towed to the gate.

Tower attempted to have an Aircraft Y flight takeoff before us; but there was not enough separation. I called for a go around passing 200 ft as Aircraft Y was still rolling with no sign of the takeoff rotation.  We flew a standard go around with a Tower instructed turn to 260 and 3;100 ft.  The other aircraft was still on the runway even after we called the go around.  We would have collided mid air no question had we stayed runway heading.,Air carrier pilot reported a near miss on final approach with another aircraft that received ATC takeoff clearance on the same runway. Pilot performed a go around to avoid a collision.

We checked the synopsis page and it was zero. We quickly performed the QRC; and completed the ECAM actions and QRH. We were over waters airspace so we looked at suitable airports if we needed to land. I decided to contact dispatch and Mx (Maintenance) control over Sat phone to formulate a final plan and have them contact the appropriate ATC to [request priority handling]. ZZZZ airport seemed like a more suitable place for us to land based off the aircraft's condition and the facilities available to us there. I then notified the inflight crew of the situation and used condition yellow. After that I notified our pax (passengers) we had an indication one of the aircraft systems was out and we would be diverting. We had a normal approach and landing but stopped on the runway to get towed off because we had inop nose wheel steering. We had no further problems.,A320 pilot reported receiving a message for low level of hydraulic fluid. Flight diverted and after landing was towed off runway.

As we received position and hold on runway XX; we obtained an amended takeoff clearance to turn on a heading of 140 and climb and maintain 4;000'. Take off roll was normal; and immediately after liftoff; we received a momentary ""takeoff warning"".  I promptly verified that the speed brake handle was fully forward in the retract position as I remembered this was an issue with the micro switch; and I also verified that the flap handle was in the Flaps 5 detent. The takeoff warning only lasted approximately 3-4 seconds; and we continued to climb to the assigned altitude and heading. At this time; I noticed that the flap indicator had a split; I believe the right flap was at 5; and the left flap was less than 5 with a definitive split. I instructed First Officer to turn on the autopilot. I immediately informed the tower that we had a mechanical issue with the flaps and would return to the airport; so I [requested priority handling]. We requested vectors to give us time to work on the checklists; coordinate with the flight attendants briefing and send a message to dispatch via the ""Divert"" function on the ACARS. First Officer continued to fly the aircraft and communicate with the tower while being vectored. I ensured that one of us remained in ""Terrain"" due to the terrain in the area while the other had ""WX radar"" active due to the storms near the airport. Fortunately; the initial heading kept us away from any terrain. I proceeded to the Non-Normal checklist and determined the issue was ""(NG) Flaps Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry"" Non-normal Checklist. I petitioned ATC that we needed the straight in ILS Z XX.  They asked if we were ready to proceed; and I replied; ""No;"" as we needed vectors (time) to prepare. While First Officer continued as pilot flying and I pilot monitoring; I completed the following necessary tasks: Non-normal checklist; loaded the approach and extended off the farthest waypoint; set VREF 40+30 plus wind additive; re-cruised the VNAV; briefed the approach; briefed the FAs; etc. Upon completion; I stated that I was ready to transfer controls to execute the landing.  As I took control; I instructed the First Officer to double-check and verify that I completed the necessary checklists; including the landing distance assessment due to the high approach speeds and runway conditions. We also asked for braking action reports; which were reported as ""Good"" by an Airbus 320.  I asked for the ""DEFERRED items"" checklist and gave the Double Chime indicating imminent landing. We informed tower ATC that we were ready to commence the approach and to have equipment standing by. We broke out about 600' on the ILS and landed smooth and firm with Max reverse thrust and MAX Autobrakes. We exited the runway at taxiway 1 and requested the equipment to follow us to the gate to ensure no issues with our brakes or tires. I also requested a thermal scan of the brakes; to which they replied that it was ""normal"". Operations had us park at the gate; which was not operational. After completing the parking checklist; I made the necessary ELB (Electronic Log Book) right-ups; one for the Trailing Edge Flaps Asymmetry Log and another for the overweight landing log.  Interestingly; the flap indicators at that time showed both flaps with no split at flaps 2; our detent that was dictated in step 1 of the Non-normal checklist. I had a debrief with the First Officer and thanked him for his expertise.  I contacted Operations; who informed me that they were bringing portable stairs to the aircraft.  I explained to them we were at a non-operational gate. Therefore; I requested a gate change with a working jet bridge to offer egress. After the stairs were installed and the main cabin door opened; the gate agent and mechanic wanted to speak to me and entered the flight deck. The mechanic wanted the failure details; and the gate agent requested ""on/in"" times. After talking to the gate agent and the mechanic; I went in the forward entry and made a PA to the passengers; briefly explaining what had happened without giving too many details. I kept it simple to reassure them and mentioned that we were in the process of getting a new gate.  I asked the flight attendants to give the passengers whatever snacks; drinks; or water. I used the First Officer's phone to call Dispatch. In hindsight; I learned that I should have called the Chief Pilot first. The Chief Pilot called the First Officer's phone to speak to me. (The first officer has an international data plan; while I did not).  I do not recall the name of the Chief Pilot I spoke to; I should have written it down.   After talking to Dispatch; I talked to Maintenance Control via the mechanic's phone and gave them the details of what happened. Throughout the time on the ground; I had difficulty communicating with the ZZZZ [airport] Operations due to language barriers and their slow response as I insisted on a gate. Maintenance continued to complete the tasks set out by Maintenance Control. I asked if the mechanics physically looked at the flap transmitters; wiring; rigging; etc.; and their reply was they were doing a BITE (Built In Test Equipment) test via the avionics bay while running through each of the flap settings. As time progressed (it was approximately an hour since I blocked in); I kept requesting a gate due to the long tarmac delay. Another gate finally opened; but we had to wait for another air carrier to vacate. When it was time; I told the passengers to take their seats; and we were towed to the gate. Then; all the passengers deplaned. Maintenance continued running tests and eventually signed off the paperwork. As my adrenaline began to drop; I realized that I was physically and emotionally drained from the experience.  I asked the First Officer how he was doing since I did not think it was best for me to continue. He conveyed that he was fit to continue. A deadheading pilot; a Captain B; offered to inquire to see if he was legal to fly. I decided to call Crew Scheduling to inform them of the situation and request a pilot change because I was physically and emotionally drained.  Scheduling asked when I would be fit for duty; calling out numbers; i.e.; 10hrs; 11hrs; etc.; frankly; I was so drained; I replied 10.  They scheduled me to deadhead back to ZZZ [airport] the next day. I asked if I could fly back to ZZZ later that day. Then; I realized I could ride the jump seat on the flight; basically swapping positions with Captain B. Scheduling and I conferred and chose the jump seat option on the flight. They instructed me to notify them when I landed in ZZZ [airport]; which I did later that evening. I asked Capt. B if I could fly in the jump seat and he said yes. The gate agent offered me the Deadheading captain's seat as an option; but I elected to remain in the jump seat just in case any problems developed again; I felt I could assist. Once we got confirmation that Capt.  B was legal and could fly the trip; I went up to the gate; received my jump seat pass; and made a public announcement to the passengers that I would no longer be the captain of the aircraft and Capt. B would be in charge. We flew back to ZZZ without any further issues. I reached out to the Chief Pilot after I arrived in ZZZ.""",B737 Captain reported a flap asymmetry during takeoff resulted in return to departure airport and safe landing.

We reviewed the MELs; most were just placards; but one: 36-11-XX-X specified a unique procedure regarding the high pressure valve. We briefed the OEB61 Issue 1.0: CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT and determined that if an excess cab alt alert appeared that we 'may unduly disregard the CAB PR EXCESS CAB ALT alert; or delay the start of the emergency descent when recard. The captain performed pilot flying duties while I performed Pilot monitoring duties. We followed the procedure for the MEL's procedure on taxi and takeoff; and climbed out normally. We reached cruise at FL340; shortly after cruising for a few minutes; a CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT message appeared on the ECAM. We evaluated the message; compared it with the OEB (Operations Engineering Bulletin); determined the message differed from the OEB. Within about 20 seconds of this message; the Flight attendants called: the captain took the message in which the flight attendants indicated that their emergency light for pressurization was going off; aural warning for depressurization was going off; and it was communicated that they might be having a depressurization issue in the cabin. Following this information; we immediately put our oxygen masks on; the captain indicated for me to take the flight controls; descend; and request that ATC give us a descent and a turn back towards ZZZ.  We came to the conclusion that based off the CAB PR SYS 2 FAULT; the aural and visual warnings in the cabin; and the desire for the safest outcome; we agreed to descend to 10;000 feet to assure the safety of our crew and passengers. We were overflying our OA1 point and decided to [advise ATC] to remove any altitude or heading restrictions and allow us to return back to ZZZ rather than diverting towards ZZZ1. We agreed that given the stress of the situation and the possible safety risk of our passengers that reconvening in a holding pattern at 10;000 feet would be the safest decision to safely aviate the aircraft; determine our best course of navigation; and later inform ATC of our plan. Once we reached 10;000 feet; ECAM messages cleared and our pressurization gauges indicated normal operation. We held for about an hour to burn off enough fuel to get the aircraft below the max landing weight. We briefed over our plan; updated our route; and checked in on the well-being of the each other; our flight attendants; and the passenger on board. We notified dispatch; ATC; and made sure all of the appropriate sources were properly notified. Once below our max landing weight of 145;505 lbs; we notified ATC that we would like to head back to ZZZ. They rerouted us to allow us to safely navigate back to the airport at 10;000 feet; and joined the ILS via a few fixes and radar vectors. We landed safely and taxied back to the gate as if it were a normal operation. We debriefed the situation and determined that heading back to the airport was still the safest decision and were ultimately happy with the outcome of our decision-making.,A320 First Officer reported a pressurization alert resulted in a diversion to a safe landing. First Officer also indicated an operations engineering bulletin confused flight crew about the validity of ECAM alert.

EICAS gear Indications showed the nose gear up and locked; but both left and right main gear remained in the cross hatched"" in transit position.  Vibration of the aircraft was indicative that gear(s)/door(s) were not up and locked.  The status page also confirmed the APU had auto shutdown. ATC was notified.  A request was made to level at 10;000 ft and vectors in order to trouble shoot.  Airspeed was kept at 250 knots or below throughout. [Advised ATC] in order to facilitate the requested altitude and delayed vectors in high density airspace.  As per training in a ""non-normal"" scenery; aircraft control and radios were transferred to the FO while the relief pilot and Captain ran appropriate checklist; and conferred with dispatch and Maintenance. As a result; the determination was made that the aircraft should return ZZZ. The flight attendants were notified and passengers were updated numerous times throughout the event. Further discussion between dispatch and the crew resulted in the decision to dump fuel in order to place the aircraft closer to maximum landing weight due to reasons such as; possible main landing gear integrity; main landing door(s) stuck in a full down position; and high crosswind/gust being reported at ZZZ.  ATC was advised. The aircraft was climbed to 13;000 feet and vectors were issued toward the fix ZZZZZ over the water.  Fuel dump was conducted via appropriate checklist. Upon completion; ATC assigned routing back toward ZZZ for an ILS approach to Runway XXR.  The approach was briefed as per SOP; to include the potential to proceed to a longer runway and more favorable wind conditions at ZZZ1; if necessary.  As requested; ATC assigned a lower altitude/airspeed in order to extend the gear early; in the event there was a need for completion of any further required checklist; should it be necessary. Once the gear was lowered; indications showed showed all down and locked.  A normal landing to XXR was conducted. The aircraft was cleared from Runway XX Right and Left; eventually onto Taxiway 1 for gear inspection. Crash fire and rescue confirmed that the left main gear door was in the full down position. The aircraft was taxied uneventfully to the gate.  Maintenance confirmed the left main gear door was in the full down position; hence the EICAS DOORS light.  Of particular note; throughout the evolution; the captain justified all decisions and consulted with the crew for input throughout. The relief pilot was a great asset; with continuous involvement in completion of checklist; monitoring the pilot flying; keeping the cabin crew/passengers updated; and backing up the control seats.  A thorough post flight brief was conducted by the crew as per SOP as well as a briefing with station maintenance team that met the aircraft.""",B767 flight crew reported a Main Gear Door did not close so they returned to departure airport.

FO selected Multi-Function Flight Display System page and pointed out Hydraulic Quantity A was at 18% and pressure was 2940. Crew ultimately completed Loss of System A non-normal; and conducted a visual approach to RWY XX at ZZZ. Upon vacating runway; requested visual inspection of aircraft by fire team and tow to gate by operations. Crew experienced no further issues and debriefed with MX personnel at the gate before deplaning and continuing on Pairing.,B-737 First Officer reported a partial loss of one hydraulic system during cruise flight. The flight landed and received a tow to the gate.

We [requested priority handling]; APU was started to avoid any excessive electric and pneumatic workload of ENG 1; ENG 2 was tried to be used with caution; resulting in another explosion and high n2 vibrations and abnormal parameters; after landing in Runway XX ZZZ2 we decided to shut down eng 2 and continued to a gate waiting for instructions.Visual inspection after landing revealed smoke/burnt traces or marking in the under side of the right wing; and on the eng 2 outlet,A320 Captain reported an ENG 2 CLOG ECAM followed by a loud bang and ENG 2 STALL ECAM.  Crew diverted and shut down engine after landing.

Takeoff we had approximately 23.0 and balanced fuel. Shortly after departure FO noticed a 1000 pound split between left and right tanks at about 8000 feet. Left tank was the low tank. Ran the fuel imbalance checklist and determined we had a suspected fuel leak; greater than 500 pounds split over 30 minutes. Had to use ACARS to communicate with Dispatch. Decision was made to [request assistance] and divert to ZZZ. Per fuel leak checklist; it was decided to shut down engine one. Coordination was made with ZZZ center for direct navigation and pilots discretion on the descent for the engine out. The engine out checklist was followed; and an uneventful single engine approach [to ZZZ] was accomplished. Landed and taxied clear of runway to have visual inspection by crash fire rescue. It was determined there was no active leak at that time so an uneventful taxi to the gate and park was completed.,B737 NG Captain reported diverting to an alternate airport after Number 1 engine was shut down due to a suspected fuel leak.

Captain was the pilot monitoring and the first officer was the pilot flying. These duties remained for the entire flight. Climbing through 10;000' MSL Master Caution light illuminated with ENG and associated ENG 2 OVERHEAT. QRC procedure was executed and the light extinguished at roughly 50% n1. We [advised ATC] an immediate turn back to the airfield. The QRH was then completed with the #2 engine planned to remain at 40%. The aircraft remained at 11;000' receiving radar vectors while the remaining checklist were completed. During this time the Non-Routine Landing Considerations Checklist was accomplished. ACARS code was used to notify dispatch of the situation and the airfield returning to. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was requested with ATC. The flight attendants received their brief of a Precautionary Landing; and the passengers were given a brief PA of the situation and that safety vehicles would be present for an inspection upon landing. The aircraft was then prepared for the RNAV (RNP) X Rwy XXR from ZZZZZ [waypoint]. Due to the high airfield temperatures and elevation; a flaps 15 landing was planned for incase of a go around with reduced thrust from the #2 engine. ATC gave a descent to 8;000' and clearance was given for the approach. Shortly after the aircraft slowed below commanded flap speed and the increased thrust was not sufficient in level flight. The aircraft descended to regain airspeed; and ATC gave a new clearance to maintain 7;000' until ZZZZZ still cleared for the approach. Airspeed was quickly regained and not a factor for the remainder of the flight. During short final the crew received several 'glide slope' aural warnings. This was due to having an ILS frequency tuned to a runway not in use. This was acknowledged; disregarded; and the aircraft never left stable criteria. An uneventful landing was made with the aircraft stopping next to the '3' board where ARFF was positioned. A PA was made to reassure the passengers of a brief inspection and to remain seated.  There was a brief delay in being able to reach the fire commander; but eventually the aircrew and fire command were able to establish communication on a dedicated frequency. Fire command used thermal cameras to verify there was no fire threat and the aircraft was able to safely taxi back to the gate with 2 engines. The aircraft executed a 180* turn on the runway per ATC's instruction and fire command followed the aircraft back to the gate uneventfully. This was a repeat write-up with the exact scenario occurring just two flights before. This was the first time we were operating this aircraft and upon preflight inspection we found loop B on the ENG 2 OVERHEAT inoperative. Contract maintenance was brought out and MEL'd loop B with loop A still functional. We had the discussion in our departure briefing to be prepared for this overheat condition; since no actual bleed air leak was found or fixed in the logbook; only the engine core fire detection system was replaced. After the flight; we were able to go outside with the mechanic and see the engine cowl. The QRC/QRH procedure was adequate for the most part. Had the OVERHEAT light remained illuminated the QRH directed to 'Go to the ENGINE FIRE or Engine Severe Damage or Separation Checklist.' It is unclear if that meant to execute that checklist; or to just go there and wait for a condition of that checklist and if such a condition was met; only then do you execute it.,B737-800 flight crew reported receiving an engine overheat caution light during climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and after thermal inspection taxied to the gate.

We asked to level off to troubleshoot. All engine parameters were normal and when the power was reduced the vibration was not noticeable. While we were trying to ascertain the problem ATC informed us that several aircraft on the ground reported some sort of debris came off the back of our aircraft. We contacted Maintenance Control via Dispatch. We all agreed to return to ZZZ. Engines still indicated normal. I briefed inflight and gave them briefing information due to the uncertainty of our problem. We [requested priority handling] and complied with the overweight landing QRH. We landed normally on [RWY] XYL. Once clear of the runway we had the fire trucks visually check the aircraft and they observed nothing unusual. We then taxied back to gate XX and were towed in. After shutdown I made 2 logbook write up's. One for the initial vibration and reports of debris falling from the aircraft and the other for an overweight landing noting the touchdown weight and speed. Maintenance came to the flight deck and reported we ingested a bird in our number one engine damaging the fan blades and a portion of the rear engine casing which was the debris that was reported.Airport ops found the engine debris after a runway sweep of [RWY] XXR.,A320 pilot reported engine vibration on takeoff resulted in return to departure airport. Post-flight inspection found engine damage due to bird ingestion.

We ran the appropriate checklist; [advised ATC]; and asked to return to ZZZZ as we were only a few minutes away. Using manual trim; we began the descent; notified passengers and flight attendants of the situation. and set up for the ILS XX. Once all items were completed I took the aircraft for landing; manual trim; flaps 15; uneventful landing and taxi into the gate. Upon conversing with Maintenance Control; it appears this is a repeat issue and they cancelled our flight to ZZZZ1 in wanting to replace the trim motor.,B737-800 Captain reported the electric trim system failed on climb-out and the flight crew performed an air turnback. According to Maintenance Control; this was a repeat issue.

As the Captain was running through the QRH we noticed fuel rapidly decreasing. Captain [requested priority handling] after completion of checklist; we both noticed the center tanks fuel indication was dropping rapidly and the right main tanks was also losing fuel. We were vectored back to ZZZ; Captain performed the overweight landing procedure to as a safe return.,B737 flight crew reported a rapid loss of fuel after takeoff requiring an immediate return to the departure airport.

The aircraft came to a stop on Taxiway 1. The Tower was notified and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was requested. ARFF confirmed on arrival that a fire was evident on the right main landing gears and took action to extinguish it. After coordinating with ARFF; our Maintenance and operations teams the passengers deplaned using stairs and were bussed to the terminal. No passenger injuries were reported.Cause: The Performance Data had a max takeoff below the structural limit and the heat may have caused the tire to blow. Solution: Stopping the aircraft on the Runway and not taxiing off would have been a better option.,Air carrier flight crew reported a blown main gear tire during takeoff roll.

Upon further inspection and running my hand over the 1ft long area I realized it was an actual crack in the inner pane of the windshield. I alerted the Captain and asked him to confirm my suspicion and he agreed it was a crack also. At that point the captain gave me control of the plane so he could run the QRH. I put on my shoulder harnesses as a precaution and engaged with the Captain as he ran the QRH. Since the QRH had us don oxygen masks until the cabin was 2 PSI or less and being the inner pane is structural for the window. After defending to relieve the cabin pressure to 2.0 or less at 14000 we removed our oxygen masks and prepared for a diversion. The Captain worked with Dispatch and came to the final decision that ZZZ was the best suitable diversion airport. We received routing from ATC; and adjusted our altitude and airspeed the remaining way in an effort to avoid an overweight landing. However we had already been planning on being potentially heavy at our original destination and our efforts to get under MLW wasn't going to happen without delaying landing so we just opted for an overweight landing on ZZZ longest runway which was a non event.,B737 First Officer reported a forward flight deck inner window pane failed during cruise. Flight crew diverted and landed safely.

After trim inoperative checklist was completed; FO was designated PF and a return to ZZZ was planned for an overweight flaps 15 Landing. [Priority Handling Requested] with ZZZ Tracon and landing and return to gate were nominal. Electric Trim Failure; adherence to SOP.,A 737-800 pilot reported a failure of the electric pitch trim system during initial climb; resulting in an immediate return to the departure airport.

We followed the ECAM steps which directed us to disconnect the IDG. With the loss of a major aircraft component; I elected to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. Student Captain maintained role as Pilot Flying throughout the flight. Due to being fueled for a 3.5 hour flight and not seeing the need (at the current state of the situation) to land ASAP (As Soon As Possible) (which would have resulted in an overweight landing) I elected to coordinate with ATC to descend to a low altitude to burn off fuel. All procedures were followed along with coordination with Dispatch. Approach; landing and taxi in were uneventful and we landed 200 lbs under max landing weight.,A319 flight crew reported receiving an Integrated Drive Generator low oil pressure indication in cruise. Flight crew returned to the departure airport and landed safely.

After discussion we decided to Monitor; get the checklist ready and begin looking for possible diversion airports. We also sent a message of Dispatch to keep them informed. Shortly thereafter the quantity dropped to 5; the reverse coloring appeared on the display and we began to notice a fluctuation of about + - 10 PSI of the oil pressure. We [notify ATC of our situation] and requested to vectors to ZZZ. I began to read the Low Oil Quantity Checklist but had to discontinue it due to our close proximity to ZZZ and the amount of tasks left to handle. The quantity dropped to 4 just a minute or two after and the Captain asked me to [request priority handling]. We were given radar vectors to ZZZ. The Captain continued to fly and communicate with FAs (Flight Attendant) and PAX (Passengers) while I handled ATC; Dispatch and the box. Dispatch was able to send us a release and weather for ZZZ. All normal checklists were completed on schedule. As we were below 10000ft; the quantity dropped to 1qt. I elected to have the ENG Shutdown checklist up on my iPad ready if we have to shutdown. We also started the APU. We quickly discussed the possibility of delay vectors if we had to shutdown but continued towards the airport. At some point below 1000ft the oil quantity blanked out. We touched down shortly after uneventfully and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) was waiting for us. Once we exited the runway they approached the aicraft and confirmed oil streaks along ENG 1. We shutdown the ENG immediately upon confirmation. We taxied to Gate XX and accomplished normal shutdown procedures. After shut we noticed that Oil quantity on ENG 1 increased to 3qts. The difficulty with an unplanned diversion and lack of time cannot be overlooked. It was difficult to accomplish all tasks in a short amount of time. It also felt like we were racing against the oil quantity. I feel that one thing we could have done to help the situation was reduce ENG 1 to idle. That may have bought us some more time and reduced the racing"" or ""running out of time"" feelings I'm sure we were both feeling. The idea had come through my mind but I didn't speak up as we were both heavily task saturated and I did not want to stress the Captain any more.""",B737 First Officer reported loss of engine oil quantity during cruise. Flight crew diverted and after landing found evidence of oil leak.

[Requested priority handling] with ATC and completed flight manual procedures followed a mostly uneventful overweight single engine landing at ZZZ on Runway XXL. Aircraft was stopped on the runway and immediately visually inspected by ZZZ Fire Fighting. After verifying no externally visual issues the aircraft was taxied to the gate for normal shutdown and passenger deplaning. FO was PF and did a superb job. ATC used a single frequency for approach; landing; Fire Fighting and Taxi which was a great help in reducing workload. It's important to note that the airframe vibrations noted above were very mild and the engine overheat indication was a mild EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) exceedance. Immediately after the engine was secured all abnormal engine indications and very mild airframe vibration ceased. Also; as the CA; I made the decision to make the FO the PF for the single engine landing not because he was the PF when the event happened; but because it was the best decision in this situation. I would have assumed PF duties if at any time I felt this particular FO was not up to the task; but he most definitely was up to the task in this situation. This allowed me to better monitor aircraft systems while completing all required checklist items and communicate the situation to all entities; both inside and outside the aircraft. We train this way at [our] Company and that training paid off.,B737 flight crew reported engine failure and airframe vibrations during climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and performed a single-engine landing.

The first officer and I would describe the abnormality as if you were to abruptly step on the left rudder pedal and create a quick; hard yaw to the left. There were no ECAM notifications and we checked that there were no abnormalities to any of the system pages.  The only normal"" indication we noticed was whenever the aircraft yawed to the left; the rudder on the flight control page respectively moved with it.  The yawing moment started out with a frequency of every 10-15 seconds and our concern grew as the frequency became closer together.  The first officer took over the flight controls and radios and I called dispatch to notify them of the abnormality.  They instructed us to check both autopilots and manual flight and unfortunately the condition continued.  After disconnecting with dispatch; the frequency continued and we decided the safest option was to divert to the closest airport.  I spoke with flight attendants asking if they felt the disturbance and they said they felt it but wasn't that aggressive in the cabin.  ZZZ was roughly 50-60NM off our nose so we started the diversion by notifying ATC; going through the diversion checklist; notifying dispatch via ACARS; setting up for the approach; notifying the customers and briefing the flight attendants if condition escalated.  Due to it not being a flight control malfunction we did not [request priority handling] but notified ATC that it was an abnormality and we wanted CFR (crash fire rescue) as a precaution.  We landed with no incident and taxied safely to the gate in ZZZ.""",A320 pilot reported the aircraft began to produce a yawing moment during cruise which continued to increase in frequency.

LFA communicated to the rest of the crew of the situation. Captain informed passengers over the PA of the situation and being diverted to ZZZ. LFA discussed with crew appropriate procedures according to the Flight Attendant Manual (FAM) and could potentially turn to a more serious situation. The event went smooth without any incident as the aircraft landed in ZZZ airport safely.,A319 Captain reported landing safely at an alternate airport after inflight shutdown of the right engine.

Just about to level off at 34000' and lost all B hydraulic fluid.  Then subsequently got COND FWD CARGO DUCT OVHT ECAM. The latter was unusual because the HOT Air switch was off and the valve was closed -yet it still showed over 200 degrees going into the cargo area - suggesting to me there was a duct leak or air was leaking past the valve. This in conjunction with the loss of B hydraulic fluid led to my decision to [request priority handling] with ZZZZ control and return to ZZZ.  We performed all checklists and procedures and returned to ZZZ; complying with the overweight landing procedure and precautionary landing procedures in our QRH. We landed uneventfully on runway XX and had ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) look over the aircraft to make sure we were safe to taxi to the gate.Cause: It would be best practice to have maintenance clear as many MEL's as possible prior to dispatching aircraft because this compounds any other mechanical issues that may arise.,A319 pilot reported receiving an ECAM message during cruise for Cond FWD Cargo Duct Overheat and a loss of B system hydraulic fluid.

We advised ATC of the situation and let them know we wanted a vector towards ZZZZ airport. We ran the immediate action items and the checklist. I flew the plane and talked on the radios as the Captain coordinated with dispatch and Maintenance Control.We [requested priority] and shot the ILS Runway XXL in ZZZZ with reduced thrust in the #1 engine. We had an uneventful landing and pulled off the active runway. We set the parking brake and requested inspection of the engine prior to taxiing back to the gate. Flight Attendants and Passengers were kept informed throughout the entire situation.,Air carrier flight crew reported during climb they received an Engine 1 overheat annunciation. The flight crew reduced the trust on the number one engine and landed safely at the departure airport.

So we coordinated the night prior to meet at the airplane in lieu of operations. My commute in to the gate was delayed. There was a longer than usual delay waiting for the bus from the employee lot. Known crew member resulted in a random selection. During this I noticed a last minute aircraft swap and resultant gate change. That information changed my transit to the gate and that transit on the 'people mover' was crowded and slower than usual. At the gate the manager had to brief me on approx 5 LEOs (Law Enforcement Officers). Once I got down to the airplane; two flight attendants advised me of 2 different write up's that needed to be addressed before departure (flight attendant jumpseat cushion and 5 inop direct TV screens). A third flight attendant advised me via inter phone as I sat down that the lav needed to be serviced.  It was then that I started to try to download the new release for the new airplane and read the MEL. We were already boarding. Our normal preflight was then disrupted by approx 5 LEOs  (Law Enforcement Officers) coming in succession to the cockpit to check in.We put in chat and called to ops for lav service. The FO had already called maintenance for the jumpseat issue before my arrival. Maintenance was on the scene quickly and above average. They very quickly addressed all of new issues and then; because they happened to be there; discussed the MEL for ENG 1 loop B. We all looked at the fire panel and noted that despite the MEL; BOTH was selected on ENG 1. With review of the MEL and with maintenance concurrence; I selected loop A; it and tested successfully. The maintenance rep had a new maintenance release for us immediately as the write up's were addressed.Additionally; during all this; the ground crew was attempting to connect unsuccessfully using multiple ground to cockpit alerts and use of hand signals to establish comms. The lav service also required multiple calls to the back and calls to ops to see if it had been accomplished.With numerous interruptions we completed our pre-flight briefings. Ground headset communication continued to be a problem with many interruptions. At one point somebody signaled the FO to release brakes with hand signals; counter to the ground communications that had just finally been establish.The primary threat briefed was that this was a very busy push; and mitigation was to slow everything down; which we did. We ended up blocked out 1 minute late. The normal runway XX was closed resulting in a high density taxi environment and wait time. On departure we were kept level multiple times below 10k for long periods on vectors.Above 10k; things resumed to normal. Not long after we notice a solid master caution. The system annunciator was not illuminated. After searching quickly for the cause of the master caution unsuccessfully; we depressed the recall. The OVHT/DET (Overheat Detector) was then illuminated. Looking at the fire panel the Engine Overheat light was then observed. We then actioned the immediate action items. On reaching idle the light remained illuminated. By this point we had slowed our ascent; transitioned above 18; and had to start interacting with ATC for a level off and return [requested priority handling]. By the time we got to the QRC/QRH and started to go to the engine shutdown checklist; the light extinguished. QRH directs that the engine be run at a thrust level that does not illuminate the overheat light.QRH complete; we transferred controls to the FO. I sent an ACARS to dispatch; gave the flight attendants the brief stating that this would be a normal landing and not anticipating an evacuation. I asked that one of them to visually check the left engine and call back only see if they saw anything unusual. I then made a PA.With discussion we elected to keep the engine running at idle and use it for landing; while briefing actions that we would take if the light reilluminated and forced an engine shutdown. We reviewed landing procedures; including engine failure/shutdown on final.After reprogramming the FMC I attempted to get landing data for ZZZ for an overweight landing. It kept returning an error code regarding being the correct aircraft. I'm not sure if this was normal or I was doing something incorrect. In the process of reviewing single engine landing I looked up the landing distance in the non normal configuration chart for flaps 15; saw that it was more than adequate for planned runway XYL; selected max auto brake and continued.My formal brief for the descent and approach was disjointed and not very comprehensive; briefing things more as they came up on the arrival. That was an error from the threat of constant distractions.The support from the FO was honestly outstanding and far above his part 121 experience. He brought up several pertinent issues at appropriate times; had a calm; helpful demeanor; flew the airplane well; and was absolutely methodical with checklists and procedure.During the arrival we transferred controls back to the left seat. It was then that I realized I had not actually looked at the overweight considerations in the FM and asked my FO to quickly review those to make sure we had not missed anything. While the FM discussion on overweight landings is good; it is not suited to a return environment. A QRH or supplementary procedure with bullet points would be much more useful than a several paragraphs of a long discussion.The small difference between on speed and max flap speed was alarming to see. Even a minor gust could have resulted in flap load relief and mandated a go around below 500'; and bringing power up to go around power on an engine that could go into overheat would have been uncomfortable. I had elected to make the approach at flaps 40 with the idea that we would be fast on approach and I wanted to be as slow as possible. I also thought that the decrease in approach speed would be commiserate with the difference in maximum flap speeds. I realize now that was incorrect and flaps 30 would have been more appropriate.The landing was uneventful. We taxied clear of the runway towards the emergency vehicles and stopped to allow them to check us. Coordination with ATC and fire service was seamless and expeditious. I made an announcement to the passengers that the service vehicles were quickly checking on us out of an abundance of caution. After they checked the engine and the brakes; the overheat light having never reilluminated; we elected taxi back to the gate. I kept both engines running because we were heavy; could shut the engine down at any time we got the light; and had emergency vehicles following us.After shutdown at the gate and parking checklist; I made another announcement apologizing for the inconvenience; and advised everybody to check their apps and talk with the Customer Service Representative regarding their amended travel plans. Me and the FO quickly debriefed but as soon as we opened the door maintenance were there and needed their debrief.Because I was busy as well I quickly wrote up the engine overheat and overweight landing without any detail because I assumed that I would have an extensive verbal debrief. As well it would have taken me a very long time to type out all the details on the ACARs. Maintenance expressed some displeasure with this.  If I had to do it over again I would have waited to type the writeups with maintenance beside me so the appropriate details would be in the original writeup.Chief Pilot's office support was great. We were met at the gate by the Chief Pilot's office representative. He put us at ease; helped us with a human factor survey; support and with our schedules; etc.Following all that I met the flight attendants in the back and had an extensive debrief. I had intermittently monitored their PA's and knew they had donea great job despite all the stress.As we were leaving the flight deck finally; the FO noticed that the engine overheat light had reilluminated with the engine shut down. I called maintenance to update that fact.I made an announcement to the passengers at the gate; called the Chief Pilot; and went to the Chief Pilot's office to further debrief with the  Chief Pilot's office representative.,B737 flight crew reported the master caution and number one engine overheat lights illuminated during departure climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport and landed safely.

At about 1;500 feet the nose gear and right main gear were down. However; we got an indication that the left gear door was open. That was followed by the left gear showing unlocked on both the ECAM and landing gear panel.At this time; we advised the tower we would like to execute a missed approach. We had several seconds to discuss what we would do and then we went around. We elected to keep the landing gear down. On the go-round; tower; advised us that the left gear did look down. Also while on the go-around; the left gear door closed and the left gear went from unlocked to down and locked and green.Who are you contacted ZZZ departure and they vectored us for a close and left downwind. ZZZ1 Tower was able to visually inspect our gear and didn't say it. It looked down. We continued on and landed visually in ZZZ1 with no further incident.However; after landing; received a caution for landing gear system disagree. I wrote this all up in the logbook and maintenance met the aircraft at the gate.,A320 flight crew on final approach reported main gear not down and locked.

We were able to stop the aircraft just as we entered the high speed exit but were not clear of the runway.After maintenance came out to inspect the aircraft; they stated the control arm pin was missing and the nose gear assembly was cocked 90 degrees. There were no cockpit indications that there was a failure of any systems prior to landing or after we stopped.,B737-800 crew reported a loss of control during landing rollout.  Crew reported nose-wheel steering failed along with noise/vibrations from nose-wheel area requiring a tow to gate.

Refer to CA or FO report for more precise info. I had almost started to sleep as relief pilot on first break in the crew rest area; when my fellow Relief Pilot 'wakes' me; and tells me they shut down an engine. He had not yet finished getting ready in his bunk; and re-entered the cockpit before me. I quickly dressed and re-entered the cockpit; hooked up headset; etc. as the CA and FO started the fuel jettison non-normal checklist. They had already shutdown the right engine; etc.; before I re-entered the cockpit. I assisted by talking with Dispatch on SATCOM; relaying for crew. We decided not to pass over the suitable alternate of ZZZ. Dispatch provided ZZZ weather; and the previously requested landing data messages (LDM's). Because it took a while before the LDMs showed up on the printer; I referred to the 200B Non-normal landing distance table; calculating for ENG SHUTDOWN L; R (Flaps 20). I rounded up our actual gross weight to 480.0 to minimize extrapolation and derived a required landing distance of 4800 feet. My fellow Relief Pilot Q-C'd my calculation. We were happy I did the calculation; because Dispatch sent up LDMs only for flaps 30 and flaps 25. We compared my number to those from Dispatch for good measure and we agreed autobrakes 4 would be sufficient. (And they were.) I backed up the PF and PM; etc. and conferred with my fellow Relief Pilot as necessary. I also assisted communicating with the purser; updating our status and estimated landing time; etc. Our CRM seemed professional and effective to me and us as a crew. Our training kicked in very nicely. We backed each other up. The CA had set an open tone from the start of our flight brief and maintained it throughout the entire flight. He effectively managed time-critical tasks and delegated appropriately. As a crew we freely tested assumptions amongst each other. ATC; ZZZ tower; ground; all supported us in excellent fashion. Passengers thanked us for getting them to ZZZ safely.,Air Carrier flight crew reported while in cruise receiving engine oil temperature warning resulting with the air crew landing safely at the first available airport.

We looked for any abnormal which none was found.  The Captain then proceeded to contact Maintenance Control for any ideas.  A short time after at about 36;000 feet we had intense sparks and smoke at which time we donned the oxygen masks; established communication; and ensured the seat belt sign was on.  We decided to immediately divert back to ZZZ.  At this time we noticed the windshield overheat caution light was illuminated at which time we turned off the Captain's windshield heat.  In addition; the Captain notified dispatch; Maintenance Control; and prepared the flight attendants with the brief items.  He also advised the passengers of a mechanical issue and our intention of returning to ZZZ.  We returned to ZZZ without any other further incident.,A Boeing 777 pilot reported a sparking cockpit windshield; followed by a windshield overheat indication; resulting in an immediate return to the departure airport.

I looked down for a diversion city and saw ZZZ at 160 miles; I advised FO lets go to ZZZ; he recommended ZZZ1 100 miles behind us; long runway; agreed with him and while I was flying with AP on; he [notified ATC] and asked to divert to ZZZ1; Center gave us a left turn and a descent.  While I made the turn and started the descend I advised the FO I have the airplane and the radio; and directed him to run the A sys hyd loss check list in QRH.  While descending I changed the destination in the FMC to ZZZ1 and went to ACARS and sent a dispatch message.As we got close to ZZZ1 and QRH was read and complied with; I advised FO the we will extend the gear on left downwind to Runway 18L just in case we run into issues for extending the Gear.  We extended the gear and everything worked normal; we received some residual fluid back and I believe the Qty went up; do not remember to what percentage.  we had 6 down and lock green lights; we had fire rescue standing by.  I landed on 18L smoothly and rolled off taxiways B and stopped for fire rescue to do visual inspection; they advised after landing there was no residue on the runway; with that said we taxied to gate B10 while fire and rescue followed.We parked then I heard from fire rescue on the frequency that there is a high press spray leak on the right wheel well; spraying fluid on number 3 tire creating a puddle.  Aircraft parked I went outside to see the leak and took videos for Maintenance Control and stated to communicate with Maintenance Control.  Asked FO to do a Electronic Log Book via ACARS.  Eventually fire rescue recommended to turn off the packs and the APU which we did.,B737 flight crew reported a loss of Hydraulic System A pressure and fluid; resulting in a diversion to the nearest suitable airport.

Very quickly; smoke started appearing in the cockpit through the ceiling vents.  I turned the autopilot and autothrottles off and pulled the #1 thrust lever to idle.  We donned our oxygen masks and [asked for assistance] and requested to land at ZZZ1.  The smoke dissipated within 3 minutes although we could still smell it in the air.  I talked to the flight attendants; and they echoed what we experienced with the smoke in the cockpit - it dissipated quickly.  I tried pushing the #1 thrust lever up slowly and started to experience the vibration again; so I pulled it back to idle and left it there.  We had just passed over ZZZ1 so we were very close to the airport - because of this; there was no need to do a drift down analysis.  Because; in my opinion; [I had] such a sharp First Officer; I felt the safest course of action was for [them] to continue running the checklists while I flew the airplane and talked to ATC. I felt it would have caused more confusion to transfer controls. We requested a descent and vectors so that we could run checklists and prepare for an approach and landing at the ZZZ1 airport. Once we got the aircraft stabilized in a descent; I called the flight attendants to get a situation report - they assured me everything was good in the cabin.  I made an announcement to the passengers that we would be diverting to ZZZ1.  I also sent a diversion message to dispatch.  I told the FAs that we would stop on the runway and that we would not be evacuating.  We ran the Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist followed by the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist.  The Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist is lengthy; but I could see no reason to rush through the checklist since the smoke had dissipated and there was no evidence of a need to rush through any parts of the checklist in order to land more quickly.  Rushing is always a threat to safety so I did not want myself or [the F/O] to feel rushed. I asked for the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist so that we could start cooling that engine down prior to landing - the oil temperature was higher than normal.  We set up for a Flaps 15; single engine approach to runway XXR in ZZZ1; briefed the approach; and requested vectors to join the final.  Once we were fully configured for landing; I turned the autopilot off.  When I did; the flight directors disappeared from both sides.  It was a clear VFR day; and I was stabilized with the VASI in sight; so I felt the safest course of action was to continue the approach and land without the flight director. It was a stable approach throughout.  We landed in ZZZ1 and stopped on the runway allowing CFR trucks to observe the outside of the aircraft.  When they gave us the 'all clear' we attempted to taxi to the gate.  Unfortunately; one of the brakes had locked up; so we requested a tow tractor to pull us into the gate.  All the passengers were seen by the fire rescue team and no injuries were reported to my knowledge.The causal factor was a problem with the #1 engine.  I don't know how this could have been avoided.,B737-800 flight crew reported safely diverting to an alternate airport after experiencing #1 engine issues that resulted in an inflight shutdown.

We accomplished the immediate ECAM action items and reviewed the affected aircraft system components.  I made the decision to land the aircraft given the weather conditions (VMC/dry runway) and the runway length for ZZZ XXR (11;000+ feet); our fuel status at the end of a mid-flight reroute (6;000 lbs); and most importantly; the lack of aircraft performance due to the high density altitude at ZZZ and the inability to retract the landing gear (associated with the hydraulic failure) in conjunction with the high terrain surrounding the ZZZ airport.  [Assistance was requested] with the ZZZ Tower and Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) responded to our aircraft.  The landing was accomplished without further incident.  The aircraft was stopped on the runway and our inflight crew members were instructed to remain seated while we coordinated with ATC/CFR and monitored the affected aircraft systems.  The passengers were informed of the situation and the aircraft was towed off the runway and to the gate (due to the loss of steering control associated with the hydraulic failure).  An ACARS message was sent to Dispatch informing them of the situation.,A320 Captain reported landing safely following an ECAM alert for low fluid quantity in the Green hydraulic system.

Since we were so close to the runway; we decided to continue to a landing. During rollout; we then got a light for #2 Electric hydraulic pump (both on system A). Landing rollout was normal; and we exited the runway at the highspeed taxiway 1. Steering and braking were a bit sluggish; but otherwise operable.  We held short of runway XXR for departing traffic. After we were cleared to cross runway XXR; I was unable to turn the tiller; so I stopped the aircraft short of the runway; and set the parking brake.  We informed ATC of our inability to move. Upon checking the SYS page; we noticed that hydraulic system A quantity indicated Zero.  We then informed ZZZ Company X ops that we would require a tow to the gate. While waiting for the tug and maintenance to arrive at the aircraft; a city vehicle approached us an noticed smoke coming from the #2 MLG (suspected to be hydraulic fluid leaking onto hot brakes). We decided to start the APU and shut down the engines. ARFF was dispatched to the aircraft; but no fire was detected. After about 25-30 minutes maintenance and a tug arrived. I handed maintenance the gear pin box through the window; gear pins were installed; then we were towed to the gate. Deplaning of passengers was normal.Cause: Mechanical failure - All parties involved performed required tasks very well.  The only thing that would have made our jobs easier would be for a more detailed QRH procedure for if a loss of hydraulic system occurs on the ground; since the QRH procedure mostly deals with a loss of a system in the air.,B737-800 flight crew reported on final approach receiving master caution warning for low hydraulic pressure resulting with the flight crew landing safely and being towed to the gate.

FO pulled power and cancelled T/O with ZZZ Tower. CA confirmed the light was off with FA1 and obtained T/O clearance from Tower. T/O was uneventful until FA1 called again during cleanup following Climb power setting. FA1 advised CA that the 1R door pressurization light was blinking red. FO continued flying and assumed radio duties while CA continued to obtain info from FA1. CA decided to return to ZZZ due to door issue. CA called dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss options and whether to conduct an overweight landing or burn fuel. After completing a landing assessment and finding the current conditions prohibited a landing option at ZZZ; CA decided to divert to ZZZ1 to avoid weather in the area. Due to runway closures at ZZZ1; CA determined that ZZZ2 was the closest suitable diversion airport. After [requesting priority handling] and taking vectors from ATC to burn down to a suitable landing weight; the FO landed at ZZZ2 without incident.Cause: Future situations like this event that arise while on the runway will result in exiting the runway and waiting on a taxiway to gather more data to confirm that no other issues are present before taking the runway again to depart.,Air carrier flight crew flying A320 aircraft reported cabin door malfunction inflight. Diverted and landed uneventfully.

Maintenance tested and cleared the writeup in ZZZ. We tested the switches on the ground and no discrepancies were noted. Upon initial climb the FO (PF); noted that the aircraft was not trimming in the nose direction passing through 14000ft. With the autopilot on; the aircraft trimmed normally. Non-normal checklist was identified. Discussion occurred between the flight crew; dispatch and Maintenance Control. It was determined that with the autopilot on; the aircraft behaved normally and it was safe to continue to ZZZ1. With the autopilot off it was considered non-normal and the checklist was accomplished and in accordance with the FOM we [requested priority handling]. A flaps 15 approach was accomplished to an uneventful landing. We taxied clear of the runway and after a brief look over by the emergency ground teams; we taxied to the gate without incident.,B737 Captain reported trim control switch failure after maintenance release resulted in a critical equipment problem and the need for an expedited landing.

The preflight walk around did not have any indication of a past or current hydraulic leak. Departure from ZZZ was normal. Upon reaching cruise altitude; we ran through the screens to check all systems. We both noticed that the yellow hydraulic system had an unusually low quantity indication - about ' - ¾ of the way to the yellow band. About 10 minutes later; we received a Y HYD RSV LO ECAM. We completed the ECAM and FM (flight manual) procedures. The CA then attempted to contact data exchange and Maintenance Control via ARINC through a call me"" ACARS. The initial frequency we were given was very broken and unreadable for the most part. We were switched to another frequency and that seemed to work better; but then seemed to completely stop working after about 5 minutes. We sent data exchange an ACARS that we were planning to divert to ZZZ1 as it was the nearest suitable airport and we were having trouble with voice communication with them. I estimate we flew for at least 60 miles; probably more; while we were trying to sort out a suitable voice link to dispatch. We [requested priory handling] with center and asked for a diversion to ZZZ1. Landing numbers were uplinked and we validated them with the FM tables. Landing on ZZZ1 was uneventful with the ARFF (Airport rescue and firefighting) standing by for the possibility of hot brakes after landing. No further assistance was needed and we taxied to the gate and deplaned the passengers via the jetway as normal.""",A319 First Officer reported receiving a Yellow Hydraulic Reservoir low ECAM message during cruise requiring a diversion.

Nose up would work and the autopilot actuated stabilizer trim would also function. After confirming with the FO that he was getting the same results; I turned on the auto pilot transferred the controls to the FO and began to run the stabilizer fail QRH. Before completing the checklist; I contacted dispatch to get a Maintenance Control patch to see if they have any suggestions as completing the checklist would remove the auto pilot availability. They responded with no additional advice outside of the QRH; so we completed the checklist and I had the FO hand fly; while I briefed the flight attendants and the passengers. Once completed we had already begun our descent into ZZZ; I [requested priority handling] transferred the controls back to myself and continued with the descent and landing. Once clear of the runway I had fire rescue do an inspection to verify everything was ok externally then taxied to our gate.  During the debrief with FO it became clear to me that I didn't do a good enough job of adequately sharing my thought process on the timing of the checklist completion and when I would [request priority handling] with ATC.  He was ok with the pace of my actions and the results however; I would have made him more comfortable during the event if I had explained the why in the moment; before performing the tasks.,B737 Captain reported the yoke nose trim switch on both sides would not command nose trim down during climb out. Flight crew continued to destination airport and landed safely.

We both agreed and executed it but then I saw the speed bug jump; it went into the over speed barber pole which was stuck at 270 kts on both sides so I kept 250 kts. We decided to keep 250 kts as well climbed and troubleshoot the problem. All our airspeed indications were working fine and the gear and flaps were up and we decided to stop our climb at FL230. We ran the unreliable airspeed non normal and couldn't really fine what matched our scenario other than erroneous maximum speed bars. After completing the non normal it did not fix our issue and the Captain called maintenance control to see if they could help but they had nothing new to add to what we could do. The Captain and I decided since we could not climb any higher or fly faster to get around weather out west we were going to divert to ZZZ1 which was along the way. We also had to do an overweight landing because of all the fuel we had on board and tried our best to burn it off by descending; using speed brakes; and configuring early. Everyone was informed of our situation we [requested priority handling] and we made an uneventful landing into ZZZ1.,B737 First Officer reported erroneous airspeed indications during the initial climb out; resulting in a termination of the climb and a diversion to a suitable airport.

We noticed a loud bang and a vibration during the rotation. We continued the rotation and raised the gear after the vibrations stopped without issue. I informed Tower we may have blown a tire on the Runway. Tower confirmed there were parts of our tire on the Runway. We coordinated with maintenance control and dispatch and decided to continue to ZZZ (our planned destination) to burn off fuel; for better weather (thunderstorms in ZZZ1) and to have a lower approach speed. I coordinated with the FAs to prepare the cabin for evacuation just in case prior to our descent into ZZZ. I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center. We flew an ILS to a 40 Flap landing on XXL in ZZZ without issue. I stopped the aircraft straight ahead and had the fire department verify the aircraft was ok. After confirming everything was ok; maintenance towed us to the gate where we deplaned the passengers normally. Dispatch and Chief Pilot were verbally debriefed.,B737 Captain reported a main gear tire failure during the take off roll at rotation speed. The crew continued with the takeoff and continued to the destination allowing the flight to burn fuel as well as conduct a landing with better weather.

I continued to climb to FL360; while the captain executed the ECAM procedures. These actions were unsuccessful in resetting the ECAM messages. Upon completing the ECAM procedures; the captain continued with the associated NON-NORMAL procedures in the purser. Running this NON-NORMAL checklist; it became clear and it was confirmed that the number 1 engine was not being monitored by the FADEC anymore. The big threat was  making sure we kept the engine within its normal parameters. The checklist guided us to the appropriate max manual N1 settings for the different phases of the flight. We discussed briefly to turn around; but the captain first would contact the company and coordinate the possible return to gate. As the airplane leveled off at FL 360; I made sure the airspeed stabilized well below the ""red line"" (max speed) and well above the ""red line"" (min speed) and verified  the N1 settings with the tables in the purser. Once the return to ZZZ decision was made; the captain informed ATC we were to return to ZZZ with ""engine indication problems"" and did not declare an emergency. Initially we were given headings followed by direct ZZZZZ for the ZZZZZ1 arrival. The captain reprogrammed ""the box"" with ZZZ as the destination and loaded the arrival. The captain returned to completing the Diversion Guide and made sure we were not overweight for landing; etc. We were given a descent. The aircraft had lost the Auto Thrust capability; but the Auto Pilot was still engaged; so I adjusted the thrust manually for a reasonable descend rate. As the aircraft was under positive control and it was responding as expected; I loaded the expected runway and approach procedures; verified the altitudes; and prepared for the arrival and approach phases of the flight; while the captain now informed the flight attendants and the passengers of the newly developed scenario. Once the captain felt that all parties were informed of the new situation; we came ""together again as a crew"" on the flight deck . This is where he informed me of all he had done and I brought him up to speed of my status and the status of the aircraft; altitude and direct to fix; the ""box having been loaded and verified by me for the arrival and approach into ZZZ. Once caught up; he resumed the PF duties and I became the PM. We ran the arrival briefing and descent checklist. We discussed the big threat in case of a ""Go-Around""; and other potential threats. An uneventful approach and landing followed. Once on the ground; we received a gate and the good news that another aircraft was already assigned  to  take the passengers to ZZZZ after all. The passengers were informed of the new gate and plane to make sure their expectations were met and would still make it to ZZZZ.After all checklists were completed and the passengers were deplaned; the CA called the chief pilot and discussed the stressful situation we had been in. It was decided; after answering and completing questions that the CA would not continue to ZZZZ; but I would.""",A320 First Officer reported engine indicating anomalies and loss of auto thrust capability during climb.

Once all ecam and apu qrh follow ups were completed we decided to reference the engine generator failure qrh follow ups. Only there; is it stated that if you have only one generator and the apu fails to LAND ASAP. This should be updated in either the MEL operating procedure for the single generator or perhaps a statement in the APU failure qrh follow up stating if it shuts down in flight with only one generator operating to land asap.,A321 pilot reported during cruise had an APU auto shutdown with #2 generator MEL'd; per the QRH the flight crew landed immediately.

At this point we had a chance to bring up the hydraulic page and could see we had Zero Quantity in the B hydraulic system. We conferred with Dispatch and Maintenance Control as it was unfolding. We [requested priority handling] and diverted to ZZZ rather than continue to ZZZ1. We ran the checklist for loss of system B hydraulic system. We coordinated a plan with Dispatch and ATC to proceed to ZZZ. We communicated the plan with the Flight Attendants and passengers and prepared for a Flaps 15 landing and alternate flap extention while reviewing the systems lost to us on the ground. Once on the ground had the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) look over the aircraft on the taxi way. They confirmed fluid dripping from the engine and a little bit of associated white smoke. We shut that engine down and had them follow us to the gate.

Continued climb out with normal indications and contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control at cruise. Decision was made to return to ZZZ and land overweight as we did not have much gas in the center tank to dump anyway. Did not initially [request priorty handling] as engine indications were normal. After checking performance and weight; decided to [request priority handling] with ATC due to overweight landing; potential hot brakes; and potential for further engine issues.

It came on and subsequently went away three separate times. We referenced the QRH and continued normally. After leveling off at cruising altitude; I pulled up the hydraulic quantity/pressure page due to the aforementioned Master Caution; and found that the Sys A Hydraulic Quantity had gone down from approximately 95% to 78%; with both Sys A and B at 95% indicating both on the ground in ZZZ and in the air on the previous flight with the aircraft (Kept the aircraft for both legs that day). We jumped into the FM; and noted factors that can cause fluid displacement; and deduced that calling Maintenance Control would be prudent. Maintenance control told us to monitor the situation for 10-15 minutes; and that they would continue monitoring the frequency we were on with them. In that time; the Sys A fluid quantity continued to decrease from 78% to 71%; and after advising Maintenance control once again; they recommended a diversion to ZZZ1. We looked at all factors; and because there was a cold front producing a significant line of weather that we would have to deviate around going to ZZZ1; that ZZZ2 (Prior to the weather system) would be the safer alternative; as we communicated that if the quantity continues to drop; while deviating around some nasty weather; there is a potential for the situation to be much less safe. I noted the Swiss cheese model"" of contributing factors that had already been ""lining up"". Out of abundance of caution; we [requested priority handling] after communicating with dispatch. The fluid quantity indication continued to drop on the descent/approach into ZZZ2; but landed uneventfully. After clearing the Runway; I communicated with Crash/Fire/Rescue to check the aircraft for any potential fluid leaks. None were noted; so we taxied to the Gate. The crazy thing- after clearing the Runway; both Sys A quantity showed 95%; right where it was when we left the Gate in ZZZ. After maintenance in ZZZ came onboard; they suspected it was a faulty transducer. The Captain and I led a thorough debrief; and deduced that with all factors/available information; that our course of action was the safest given the scenario; especially given Maintenance control's input that the indications we were receiving were not normal for our given phase of flight. The [priority handling] out of abundance of caution; with our headspace at; ""If we are losing fluid; and have lost >25% up to this point; there is a potential for extreme fluid loss in the approach/landing phase; with flight control displacement/flaps/gear"". We called the Chief Pilot in a prudent timeframe; and after a 25 minute conversation with them; they decided to remove the Captain and I from the next flight due to human factors reasons; they stated. We received necessary rest at the hotel in ZZZ2; and the rest of the pairing continued uneventfully.""",B737 First Officer reported receiving a Flight Control Master Caution for Feel Differential Pressure and low hydraulic quantity indication during climb out.

2168798,202409,0001-0600,US,Air Carrier,Passenger,B777 Undifferentiated or Other Model,Climb,Turbine Engine,Captain; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP); Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Multiengine,,Aircraft Equipment Problem Critical; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types,Automation Aircraft Other Automation; Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Flight Crew Diverted; Flight Crew Landed in Emergency Condition; Flight Crew Returned To Departure Airport,Aircraft,Aircraft,The flight departed ZZZ Runway XXL on the ZZZZZ RNAV Departure to 3000 feet. At approximately 1500 feet the Captain noted to the crew; potentially conflicting aircraft traffic at approximately the 2 o'clock position. At about the same time; one of the Relief Pilots called out an overtemperature exceedance on the right engine. The Relief Pilot also noted that the right engine EPR had initially started to drop. The Captain then turned the autopilot on and slowly retarded the right engine throttle attempting to get the right engine EGT back below the temperature exceedance. At approximately the idle position the temperature remained below the temperature exceedance and back into the normal temperature operating range but at what appeared to be an elevated temperature for the idle position. At this point; the Captain elected to intercept the ZZZ XXX radial outbound per the engine failure procedure for Runway XXL even though the aircraft was at 1500 feet since the aircraft was climbing out very slowly and the Captain wanted to ensure terrain clearance while continuing to climb to 3000 and run checklists. The First Officer [requested priority handling] for the flight and told ATC the flight would be initially intercepting and proceeding outbound the ZZZ XXX radial while working the [situation].There were no EICAS messages or automatic Non-Normal Checklists displayed on the EICAS so the crew elected to perform the Engine Lim/Surge/Stall checklist on the right engine. As the First Officer performed the checklist; it was noted that the right engine temperature would increase abnormally higher as the right engine throttle was increased out of idle. As a result of the checklist; the crew decided to bring the throttle back to idle. The crew discussed the options for the right engine and decided to keep the right engine running in idle for the remainder of the flight unless absolutely needed. The crew reasoned this to be the most prudent action since the engine was still producing thrust; was at a stable but elevated temperature at idle (than normally expected) but still in the normal temperature operating range; was not operating erratically and did not appear to be damaged. Once the aircraft was stable and the Non-Normal Checklist was complete; the Captain directed the First Officer to request vectors from ATC to an area near the ZZZ airport that we could safely jettison fuel. While getting these vectors the Captain gave control of the aircraft to the First Officer so that the Captain could coordinate with dispatch; Maintenance Control and the flight attendant. The Captain asked the Relief Pilot to call the flight attendant and inform them of the current aircraft situation and that we would most likely be returning to ZZZ. Also; the Relief Pilot was instructed to make a PA announcement updating the passengers. In the meantime; the Captain was able to coordinate a discussion with dispatch and maintenance control. Maintenance Control noted that from his equipment sensors and readings of our aircraft that the exceedance was real and not a spurious indication. The crew discussed and was in agreement that the flight should return to ZZZ after jettisoning fuel. The Captain informed dispatch and Maintenance Control of the crew's decision to return to ZZZ and asked for any other recommendations for the engine issue; jettisoning fuel and coordination for the return to ZZZ. Maintenance Control gave no further guidance and noted the crew's intention to return to ZZZ and stated he would coordinate with Maintenance. Dispatch reminded the crew to annotate the time; location and fuel amount at the beginning and end of the fuel jettison process. Dispatch also indicated that he would calculate landing data for the return to ZZZ. Once the crew arrived at the ATC coordinated fuel jettison area the Captain initiated the Fuel Jettison checklist. The crew decided to jettison fuel down to the max landing weight so that the overweight checklist would not have to be run and a maintenance overweight inspection would not be required. The fuel jettison procedures for the amount of fuel onboard took approximately 30 minutes. During this time period the crew monitored the right engine for any changes and discussed and prepared the flightdeck for the descent; approach; landing; Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) coordination and return to the Gate. The crew anticipated a normal landing and decided that if there were no issue upon landing that they would coordinate to clear the runway and have ARFF inspect the right engine on the Taxiway for any issues prior to taxiing to the gate. Upon completion of the Fuel jettison checklist; the Captain briefed the crew for a single engine flaps 20 ILS approach to Runway XXR. Dispatch was having difficulties with the landing data so the Relief Pilot ran the landing data numbers for a single engine landing. The checklists were completed for descent/landing and the Captain flew the single engine approach to Runway XXR for an uneventful landing. Upon landing the Captain cleared the Runway and ARFF inspected the right engine; found no issues; so the flight continued to Gate. The passengers were then deboarded to the gate area and turned over to the gate agents. At the gate the crew debriefed maintenance concerning the right engine temperature exceedance. The crew noted to maintenance that the exceedance temperature was approximately 666 degrees celsius. Also; from the point the crew noticed the exceedance to the point the Captain promptly retarded the throttle to idle; the time duration was approximately one minute. The Captain then debriefed with the flight attendants and with the gate agents. The Captain and the flight crew then debriefed with Dispatch and the Chief Pilot through a telephone conference call. Finally; the flight crew debriefed their own performance.,Captain flying 777 aircraft reported EGT exceedance during takeoff climb. Flight crew returned and landed uneventfully.

We contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss the situation. During this time the odor was reported again and the Relief Pilot went back and could smell it also. It did not seem to be associated with the gaspers. We ran the smoke; fire; fumes checklist; [requested assistance] and began diversion. After discussion with Dispatch and input from ATC we diverted to ZZZZ. The smell dissipated and then returned and dissipated again.

After ECAM actions were completed the CA directed the FO to fly the aircraft and he created a phone patch with Dispatch and [maintenance] via comms. [Maintenance] verified the G sys was lost but offered no other input or suggestions. Our reception with dispatch was poor and spotty. It was hard to make out much if anything. We knew we were most likely going to divert. CA led an open discussion on options with FO in put. He consulted with dispatch via ACARS. Our closest preferred diversion airport with a longer runway was ZZZ and they were between CAT 1 and CAT 2 minimums.We were halfway to our destination ZZZZ however; the terrain; possible wet runway/decreased braking action and elevation made it a less than preferred choice. CA and FO opted to return to ZZZ1 since we had the gas; the weather was VFR and they had two 11;000 ft runways. Under CA direction; the FO [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and received direct to ZZZ1. Our dispatcher working through ACARS attempted to modified the release with new landing data which caused the aircraft to have an init disagree that made our ACARS intermittent. We were able to receive a message with landing length of 4600ft. After briefing the FAs; the CA resumed PF duties. Both CA and FO reviewed the manual gear extension and tow in procedures. Coordinated tow in with company via center. The CA briefed the approach and supplementary procedures. We landed safely and were towed in.

The Captain [requested priority handling] with ATC; I leveled off and airplane while the Captain coordinated with ATC. The Captain ran the appropriate QRH and I began a turn to ZZZ. During descent the Captain and I agreed weather was approaching ZZZ rapidly and winds were less favorable (winds approx 160° gusting 40 knots). We decided to land at ZZZ1 instead overweight. While the Captain secured the #1 engine; and finished QRH/brief FAs (Flight Attendants) and passengers; I continued flying to ZZZ1 and began setting up for ILS XXL.

Shortly after liftoff; just after retracting the landing gear and with the autopilot still disengaged at around 200 feet AGL; we heard a loud banging noise. This was followed by a noticeable yaw to the left and a drop in the EPR of engine 1; from approximately 1.4 to 1.2. Within a few seconds; the EPR on engine 1 returned to normal on its own; matching engine 2. All other engine parameters remained stable; and no ECAM alerts were displayed. However; we detected a strong odor in the cockpit; similar to burning hair; and suspected a bird strike. We immediately [requested priority handling] with the Tower and requested to return to ZZZ as a precaution. After a quick handoff to departure control; we requested Runway XXC and extended our downwind leg to review the overweight landing checklist and notify dispatch. Shortly after; we were vectored for a visual approach to Runway XXC; where we landed without further issues and taxied to the gate.,A319 flight crew reported a possible bird strike during takeoff required a return to the departure airport.

From previous Captain experience he suggested that the aircraft might have a bad seal. After verifying a positive rate of cabin climb and a positive Differential pressure; we concluded that the aircraft is pressurizing correctly. I pulled out my mask to have in handy in case of a sudden depressurization. The decision at the moment was to continue the flight.From my own past experience and due the abnormally loud noise (which could potentially cause fatigue if exposed to for a long period of time) I suggested it might be something else other than a seal and we agreed that once level at cruise I would get out of my seat and further investigate. Once leveled at 32;000 feet I transferred controls to the Captain and got up off my seat. I quickly noticed that the hissing sounds comes from the observer's mask; so I pulled it out to further check it; and the hissing sound stopped immediately. I looked up to the aft overhead panel and realized that our O2 gauge read 0. There was no prior alert or light associated; and both me and the Captain agreed that we verified it was full on the ground during preflight. The decision to divert was quick; and we decided to decent to a safer altitude and divert to ZZZ1. After a brief discussion we decided to [request priority handling]. Dispatcher; flight attendants; passengers and Maintenance were advised of the situation.  About 20 minutes later the flight safely landed in ZZZ1. The aircraft was serviced and passengers accommodated. We later continued the flight to ZZZ2 once Maintenance replaced the empty O2 bottle and faulty observer's mask.,B737 pilot reported a loud hissing sound in the cockpit; attributed to a broken and leaking oxygen mask at the observer's seat position. The oxygen system was depleted; and an immediate diversion was accomplished.

Just as we were reaching FL280 I noticed a strange sound and looked to the Captains L1 window to see that there was a glowing coming from the window heating element followed by a subsequent cracking sound and the outer pane of the window cracking. Having both noticed this; the Captain and myself put on our shoulder harnesses; the Captain elected to turn off the window heats for the respective window; [requested priority handling]; and begin a descent to 10;000 feet. ATC was notified and we began a descent. During the descent the Captain took the aircraft and radios while I ran the QRH procedure for the condition WINDOW DAMAGE-FORWARD. Flight Attendants were made aware of the situation and a PA was made to the passengers advising them of the possibility of fire trucks being present when we land. Dispatch was also kept in the loop and concurred with our decision to continue to our intended destination of ZZZ. The flight continued and landed without incident.,A Boeing 737 First Officer reported a cockpit window heat element failure; resulting in a cracked outer pane; which necessitated an immediate descent and continuation to the destination airport at a reduced altitude.

It sounded as though it was on the First Officers side. I would compare it to someone holding down an air horn; like you'd find at a sports event. We both agreed immediately there must be some kind of air leak or faulty seal. We immediately requested a descent to 10;000. I told the First Officer his aircraft; his radios; tell them we want to return to ZZZ. I called the cabin who said they heard it as well; they thought it was an alarm going off; and was loud enough it could be heard significantly far back in the cabin. I explained though loud and unsettling; it was minor; we already where reaching an altitude where pressurization was no longer needed and due to the issue we would return to ZZZ for a precautionary landing; I'd call them back once we caught up. I made a calm similar pa to the passengers. I heard the First Officer at this time change frequency and the Controller asked if we were [requesting priority handling]; I told the First Officer that sounds good. I considered how it was difficult to communicate; and that we would be over weight when landing and could not logically think of any reason not to. I then called ZZZ ops and Maintenance and spoke to Maintenance; they asked if we could go to ZZZ2; i said no; it wasn't suitable; and said I was ok with ZZZ3 or ZZZ. The noise made communication difficult; thus I elected calling on the radio vs crew phone. I also sent an ACARS message and ACARS diversion report. The First Officer got us on a delay vector and down to 7000. ZZZ Maintenance called Maintenance Control and Operations Control I believe and told us ZZZ was ok but if I do get time call Operations Control to verify the best airport operationally. At this time we leveled at 7000 and the noise finally stopped. I told ZZZ that id call Operations Control. I called dispatch on the crew phone; they also requested ZZZ2; i told them unable; in which the dispatcher asked if I would go to ZZZ3. I said ZZZ3 was good; it has a longer runway than ZZZ anyway; and confirmed the company would prefer I go to ZZZ3 vs ZZZ; he confirmed and acar us the new information. We informed atc; we requested the longest suitable runway; which was XXL and was in use. We requested to have fire rescue meet us upon landing. We continued the delay vectors a few more times as we ran the non routine landing check list; and overweight landing check list. Followed by setting up and briefing the approach. We then ran the descent and before landing check list. During this I briefed the flight attendants again about the precautionary landing and made a calm reassuring brief pa to the passengers. I then took back the aircraft from the First Officer. We did the rnav XXL and we landed uneventfully on XXL; exited; followed the correct flow; passengers; inspection; and proceeded uneventfully to the Gate; in which maintenance met the aircraft.I believe our training worked very well and it felt like a good sim session. We communicated well in the flight deck; even with the barriers of a very loud noise. First Officer was very quick to identify we should descend right away to 10;000. We ran the Threat and Error Management model and both briefed each other well and checked in that we were performing normally. First Officer was an absolute asset and monumental in a safe; calm; correct outcome.,B737 Captain reported the flight and cabin crews heard a loud sound during departure climb which they determined to likely be an air leak. Flight crew diverted and completed a safe overweight landing.

The master caution alerted and after looking up I noticed the 'wing-body overheat' light illuminated.  I said 'my aircraft' and called for the wing-body overheat QRH procedure. Shortly after the light; the departure controller handed us off to center but after a short conversation with the captain; I took over the radio and communicated the captain's decision to return to ZZZ.  This malfunction had occurred the day prior on the same jet and the MX corrective action was to fix an actual problem and not just an indication. After completing the QRH procedure the light remained on and continued to remain on for at least the next ten minutes.  The captain decided to [request priority handling] and ask to be met by Crash Fire Rescue (CFR). We returned to ZZZ and was met by CFR. They scared the right side of the aircraft and found no anomalies.  We taxied to the gate and after opening the main cabin door the CFR personnel entered the cockpit and asked for the captain to sign some paperwork.  After the event and debriefing it ourselves we came to the shared conclusion that we were not fit to continue and reported fatigued. There has been a fatigue report filed by me about this event.Causal factors included: Task saturation and a high level of concern for the safety of the flight.,Air carrier flight crew reported a Wing Body Overheat warning and returned to departure airport.

I transferred control to the First Officer and began actioning a non normal checklist. I coordinated with ATC to level at 16;000 feet and sent a message to dispatch. We made a decision to air return to ZZZ and we were under max landing weight already at that point. We [advised ATC] once we made the decision to air return. I did a brief with the flight attendants and noted no evacuation required. I ran the (MAX) Flaps - Leading Edge Flaps Transit non normal checklist. Once complete; I notified the passengers we were returning to ZZZ and took control of the aircraft. We landed Flaps 15 on the longest runway available; Runway XXL uneventfully.

After resetting the left bleed air switch in accordance with the checklist; the left bleed operation and pack were restored but the crew noticed the left bleed pressure was fluctuating abnormally. We contacted dispatch and requested a conference with Maintenance Control. After discussion with Maintenance Control; we decided to continue the flight and access the pressure fluctuations prior to entering ETOPS airspace. Unfortunately; the left bleed began to operate intermittently with increased pressure fluctuations and additional ENG BLEED OFF L messages. The Captain switched off the left engine bleed and left pack in accordance with the checklist and contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control. After a short discussion; the decision was made to execute an air return to ZZZ and land overweight. The arrival; approach and landing were uneventful.,B767 Captain reported they received 'ENG BLEED OFF L and PACK OFF L EICAS' messages during climbout.

First issue was a flight control issue we noticed during our multiple level offs during our climb up to cruise. We noted that the plane was flying with a roughly 3 degree turn of roll to the right while in level flight. We tried to rectify the issue by cycling the autopilot and hand flying but the issue remained. The CA (Captain) started a discussion with Maintenance Control and Dispatch to write up the issue. While we worked problem 1 problem 2 emerged. The number 2 brake temp sensor started to behave erratically and was giving us an intermittent hot brakes ECAM and was showing brake temps up to 900C; before the sensor displayed XX and stopped providing input. We discussed our options and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. After working on problem 2 we got another ECAM for Door R Aft EMER Exit. This ECAM has the crew monitor cabin pressure and if necessary perform an emergency descent down to 10;000 ft. After discussing this third problem with Maintenance Control and Dispatch the CA decided to change our destination to ZZZ2 in order to have MX look at the plane. I contacted ATC and notified them of our intentions to change our destination; and that we were not [requesting priority handling]. We chose a lower altitude and then had an uneventful return to ZZZ after Dispatch asked us to fly there instead of ZZZ2. We landed at ZZZ and handed the plane back off to MX.,A320 First Officer reported a flight control issue during cruise followed by two unrelated equipment issues. Flight crew returned to departure airport and aircraft was sent to maintenance.

Pressure was low on both the engine and electric pumps until the gear had fully cycled. We asked for delayed vectors to assess the situation. It was decided to return to ZZZ. QRH procedure was run and after a short delay to get everything in order; and we returned to ZZZ with a visual approach to XXC backed up with the ILS. The approach and landing were normal. Fire rescue followed us to the gate and there was no need of additional services.,B737-800 flight crew reported a hydraulic pump failure upon gear retraction; resulting in an immediate return to the departure airport.

The resulting ECAM called for the affected thrust lever to be selected to idle. When the crew complied with this action; the engine fire indication was no longer displayed. The decision was made to [requested priority handling]; execute a return to the departure runway; and do so using single engine procedures with the affected engine at idle thrust. During the diversion the crew observed the affected engine nacelle temperature on the ECAM synoptic page to be elevated. The flight landed normally under maximum landing weight and stopped on the runway for evaluation by ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) personnel. ARFF reported no visual indications of damage or abnormal heat signatures and escorted the flight to parking at the crew's request.,A319 flight crew reported receiving an engine fire indication after takeoff.

We were notified via the ECAM system of a Wheel N/W STRG Fault. As we were unsure of the current status of our steering ability upon landing; we elected to go-around to work the issue. FO assumed flying and radio duties while the Captain handled checklists; the coordination with Dispatch; ZZZ Operations; FAs and Cabin. We requested delay vectors from ZZZ Approach. We sent [Maintenance] a request for help with the indicated failure. We requested a 'call me' with Dispatch with the expectation to conference [Maintenance]. We were notified via ACARS that we were too low for an ARINC patch so subsequent communications were via ACARS. The checklist was actioned; but provided no fix as any reset attempt was to only be accomplished on the ground. The Central Fault Display System (CFDS) was referenced and it indicated a steering electro-HYD Module (6GC) failure. Our status page indicated N/W STRG was inoperative.After we were unable to fix; we relayed via Dispatch and a follow up call for confirmation with ZZZ operations; a need for a tow-in after landing as we would be unable to steer. Because our situation would result in the closing of our runway after landing and the possibility of steering trouble; we did [request assistance] via ZZZ Approach. We were confident we did not have an undesired deflection of the nose wheel as there was an absence of a L/G SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT ECAM.A [safety] briefing was accomplished with purser. No evacuation advisory or prep was ordered. Passengers were notified of our situation both after our go-around and again prior to landing once we had more information. We let them know of the possible emergency vehicle presence.The landing was uneventful with the aircraft stopping straight ahead on the runway. A 'Remain Seated; Remain Seated' command was issued after landing. After an all clear was issued following the inspection from Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF); they left the scene and we waited for our tow crew to arrive which took about 10 minutes. After landing flows were accomplished and the engines were shut down. A tow was completed to gate.,A319 Captain reported landing safely after receiving an ECAM message for a nose wheel steering fault.

On short final for Runway XX; we received an engine failure on our number 2 engine at approximately 300 ft. We both heard a loud bang (the sound was probably louder to me because it was the right engine). When I computed what the noise was; I remember pitching slightly up and saw 4 white on the papis. Immediately the Captain says; 'we lost our right engine; my aircraft go around toga' and commenced a missed. The aircraft remained in a stable condition on the go around and we decided to divert to ZZZ.  After we cleaned up the aircraft; approach gave us a vector to ZZZ. The captain gave me the aircraft; finished the ecam actions and ran the QRH checklist. Approach gave us a long downwind while we completed checklist; loaded the approach into the FMS; and spoke to the passengers and flight attendants. The captain made sure I was in the green before accepting the landing clearance. We remembered to complete a descent checklist and before landing checklist. Once we safely landed with no further issues; maintenance took a look at our engine and said there was no fire or smoke. We taxied into the gate and deplaned all passengers.Cause: Include a briefing on a single engine go- around (saying call-outs aloud) for every single airport as part as the approach briefing.,Air carrier flight crew reported an engine failure on short final. The crew initiated a go-around procedure and diverted to an alternate airport for a safe landing.

We completed the ECAM 'to do' items and reviewed the non-normal checklist. Contacted dispatch and requested a phone patch with maintenance control; after concluding call we [requested priority handling] with ATC and advised we would need Runway XX at ZZZ with maintenance standing by. At this point I briefed the lead flight attendant using the brief and followed that with an announcement to the passengers explaining the situation and why there would be emergency personnel standing by. Due to the nature of the failure advised ATC we would need to stop on the runway and be towed to the gate. We were given vectors to an approx. 10 mi final; extended the landing gear using the emergency gear extension checklist and completed a normal approach and landing.,A320 Captain reported a loss of green hydraulic system prior to top of descent. Crew performed checklists and landed normally.

C Hydraulic quantity was at .49. We followed the Non-Normal checklist; which instructed us to turn off all Center Hydraulic tank pumps. When they were shut down; we had .48 remaining C HYD Quantity. At the direction of the C HYD QTY checklist; we reviewed the HYD SYS PRESS - C (Only) checklist to see the list of Inoperative items (And really--there should be a hyperlink to it!). We switched to the Left Autopilot and changed the transponder to the L position. I called the Flight Attendants; spoke with Person A and told her to please wake up the Relief Pilot and tell him we needed him on the flight deck. I told her we had a hydraulic problem and would not be continuing to ZZZZ1; but didn't have a new plan as of yet. I told her to have the Purser call me.When the Relief Pilot returned to the flight deck; he reported the FAs in the back of the aircraft smelled an acrid/burning odor right at takeoff; so pungent it made a couple of them feel ill. This information helped us come to the conclusion we did indeed have a hydraulic leak as opposed to an indication error.We contacted Dispatch and conferred with Maintenance Control. Maintenance Control told us the smell reported by the FAs was consistent with hydraulic fluid getting into the air conditioning system. We all agreed continuing to ZZZZ1 was not an option. The Dispatcher; after conferring with the Company Communications System; told us a return to ZZZ was what they wanted. Since ZZZ had long runways and good weather and a proclivity for long; straight-in final approaches; it was already one of our choices for a diversion airport; along with ZZZ1; or possibly ZZZ2; so we agreed.We [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ center. I spoke with the Purser and told her we would be returning to ZZZ with a hydraulic problem and to please inform her crew. Then I made an announcement to the passengers and afterwards we began our turn back to ZZZ. Dispatch provided us with normal landing data for Runway XXC; XXR and YYC; and non-normal landing distance (7400ft). We said we would prefer Runway YYC as it was longer and not in use per the ATIS; so there would be no issues with traffic behind us.After discussing the hydraulic leak and the possibility of hydraulic fluid on the gear and the potential for a fire with hot brakes (an overweight landing was planned--center tank fuel was depleted; so dumping fuel was no longer an option) I told the Purser I wanted them to prep for an evacuation. I told her to tell the members of her crew first; and then to call me back when that was complete; so I could make an announcement to the passengers. However; she began making the required Preparation for Evacuation PA announcement before I could talk to the passengers myself. I interrupted her PA and explained that while I believed we would have a normal approach and landing; it was only with an abundance of caution I wanted this preparation to take place. Anticipating a possible loss of C Hydraulic Pressure; we reviewed the HYD SYS PRESS C (Only) checklist and went over possible scenarios of what might happen when we started configuring and what we would do if we got the low-pressure light at certain stages of configuration. (e.g. Go around and perform the HYD SYS PRESS checklist; which requires alternate flap and gear extension; continue to landing if we were at flaps 20 and gear down; etc.) Center Hydraulic Quantity had dropped to about .42 by this time.We told ATC to plan on us being on the runway for a while; anticipating the possible loss of Nosewheel Steering and to have ARFF standing by. Once level at 9000 feet; we depressurized the cabin as per the Evacuation Preparation checklist.We had flown direct to ZZZ the entire way from ZZZZ airspace in an effort to land with as much center hydraulic fluid as possible. ZZZ Center slowed us to 210 knots on a dog leg base to final for the ILS YYC. We turned on the C Hydraulic pumps as per the checklist's Deferred Items; to extend the flaps. At flaps 5; the fluid dropped to about .24. ATC slowed us to 170 and I (now the Pilot Flying) asked for flaps 20 on schedule. I dropped the gear around ZZZZZ.So; we were at flaps 20 and gear down; established on the ILS when the C HYD PRESS EICAS came on. We elected to remain at flaps 20 for the landing; to avoid possibly draining the rest of C Hydraulic fluid or complicating a possible go-around. HYD C fluid was at approximately .18 now.We landed overweight (#330;000) flaps 20. Landing was uneventful and we rolled out; stopping straight ahead. ARFF met the aircraft and reported some steam from the right main gear; but no fire. (Highest brake temp was 4.) We requested a tow to the gate; out of concern for a loss of Reserve Brake and Steering fluid and therefore Nosewheel Steering at an inopportune time. Maintenance met the aircraft and a tug was called. Maintenance had us run some checks of the brakes (I had to pump them on and off several times.) The tug left and then Maintenance said since we had brakes; we were to taxi to the gate. I told him we didn't have Nosewheel Steering. (Although we were aware we did have the below the standpipe hydraulic fluid; after reviewing the system earlier; and not knowing where the leak was; we decided not to risk relying on the Reserve Brake and Steering System; a possible failure of which would leave us with only Accumulator brakes.) Another tug showed up and we were brought to the gate.,B767 flight crew reported low hydraulic fluid level in center system and suspected leak during cruise. Flight crew returned to departure airport as fluid level continued to decrease and landed safely.

We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance; ran the appropriate checklist (didn't fix it); then coordinated a return to gate.  With no parts available to replace the valve; MX (Maintenance) applied an MEL which I believe locked the valve closed.  After work was completed and paperwork sorted; we taxied out and took off approximately one hour late.  On climb out approaching FL100; we noticed that the cabin pressure was having a hard time keeping up with the climb.  I decreased my climb rate to give the pressurization system time to catch up; and eventually leveled off at approximately FL120.  It was during this time that we got a Cabin Altitude warning horn. We immediately accomplished the CABIN ALTITUDE QRC Checklist; donning our O2 masks and coordinating a descent to FL80.  The warning horn ceased sometime during this descent.  After taking care of immediate items in the cockpit I contacted the lead Flight Attendant to ensure everyone was OK (they were) and asked if any PAX (Passenger) O2 masks had dropped.  They had not. We coordinated with ATC for a return to ZZZZ for an overweight landing.  We took care of all checklists and coordination in holding at ZZZZ1; then were vectored for an ILS XXR at ZZZZ. I (Captain) flew the approach and overweight landing.Fire trucks met us as we exited the runway. Since our BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) values were approaching rapidly approaching 5 due to the overweight landing; we coordinated with GND (Ground) and the lead fire truck to hold on Taxiway 1 northwest of [Taxiway] 2; away from anyone and anything.  After 10-15 minutes the BTMS values reduced to 4 and below; at which point we taxied to a hard stand with fire escort; parked; and deplaned PAX and crew.,A B767 flight crew reported pressurization malfunction on initial climb and return to departure airport.

Completing the QRH procedure; step X directs the crew to open and close the manual gear extension access door.""  Upon completion of this step; the landing gear operated normally and retracted as prescribed.  While completing the QRH for the landing gear disagree; it was noted that the ""reverser"" lights on the overhead panel were illuminated for engine 1 and 2.  We completed the ""reverser"" QRH procedure and the lights remained illuminated.  Although flight characteristics were normal and cabin crew reported visual inspection of the reversers to be normal; with compounding issues and communications to Dispatch and Maintenance Control limited; I made the command decision to return to the departure station of ZZZZ.  Approximately 10;000 lbs over landing weight; we [requested priority handling] and completed the appropriate overweight landing checklist and the non-routine landing considerations checklist.  Weather at the airport was VFR with favorable winds and the runway landing distance was reported.  We requested safety vehicles be present as a conservative precaution and asked they inspect the brakes after landing.  With operations normal; flight concluded at the gate without issue and at no time was safety compromised.""",B737-800 Captain reported on initial climb a landing gear issue corrected via QRH; but further reverser warnings resulted in expeditious handling return to departure airport.

The First Officer returned. The QRH led us to put ENGINE 1 at idle thrust.All ECAMS; CAUTION messages and the QRH were taken care of per the SOP.We [requested priority handling] and diverted to ZZZ.ATC; Dispatch; Flight Attendants and the passengers were all advised of the situation.I briefed the Flight Attendant.The cockpit was extremely busy and time was very limited. I started the APU.I set up for the ILS XXR at ZZZ; briefed the approach. Received the ATIS from ATC.Completed the approach and landing checklists.Approximately on a 3-mile final we got an EGT over limit on ENG 1. As the engine was already at idle and I didn't want a possible engine fire which could have turned the situation into a urgent situation with a possible evacuation and with seconds to landing we shut down ENGINE 1.We landed as normal; I asked CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) to inspect our ENGINE 1 for smoke and fire; which they did; I also asked them to follow us to the gate.The passengers deplaned as normal and I did a maintenance write up in the log book.I called Dispatch; operations and the Chief Pilot on duty and also spoke with 3 of Company's mechanics who happened to be in ZZZ.I saw the maintenance post flight report. There were 10 Warning/Maintenance status messages and 13 Failure messages.,A320 flight crew reported engine failure inflight. Flight crew diverted and landed without incident.

I couldn't find a root cause of the failures; when we prepared for landing; we couldn't arm the auto brakes and with the continued cascading failures decided it would be prudent to [requested priority handling] and head directly to the Final Approach Fix in the event of addition system failures. After landing in ZZZ1 before leaving the runway both FMS went dark and reset with no flight information present in the system. Landing and Taxi to the gate was uneventful.,B737 Captain reported loss of heading indications on Captain's PFD; followed by cascading failures during climb. Flight crew continued to destination and after landing both FMS failed.

After a brief hesitation we successfully engaged heading mode which brought back my flight directors; in both a lateral and vertical mode. During the rest of the climb out; we discovered the Captains flight director was only displaying vertical guidance and he never recovered the heading bug or any other information on his lower compass display. Upon activating LNAV mode we both received lateral and vertical guidance; however at this time we also attempted to turn on the weather radar; only to be met with Auto Tilt failures and PWS (Predictive Windshear System) failures. At that time the we agreed to have the Captain contact Dispatch and Maintenance Control to look for a solution. While he was relaying the information; I set the aircraft up for landing due to our decreasing distance to our Top of Descent. During set up; I tried to set the autobrakes; and was met with failure. At that time; we decided to [request priority handling] and requested to proceed to the outer maker for the ILS XYL approach in to ZZZ. As we discussed; [priority handling was requested] due to the concern that this could result in a cascading failure and wanted to apprise ZZZ Approach of the possibility of needed assistance in a time critical manner. The approach and touchdown were completed successfully however upon landing; both FMCs blanked and dropped all flight information. The taxi to the gate and parking was completed successfully and uneventful.,B737 pilot reported loss of navigation; weather radar and autobrakes on departure climb.

We were in a MAX 9 aircraft that had a history of a low pressure on the hydraulic system B engine driven pump. I conferenced with Dispatch and Maintenance Control prior to the flight to make sure I understood that nothing was required of us on the verification flight other than the Electronic Logbook (ELB) report if everything passed. They concurred. The First Officer (FO) and I departed as planned and everything went normally up until the climb out . Upon climbing out around 15;000 ft.-20;000 ft.; we received a master caution. The right engine (SYS B) Hydraulic EDP had a low pressure light. The FO was flying; so I ran the QRH keeping in mind that there was a history of this. The QRH directed us to turn off the right side hydraulic engine driven pump. I pulled up the synoptic page while I was doing this step to ensure we retained pressure and fluid quantity. Pressure remained constant and the quantity rose to the max of 106% on the right hand side. I opted to conference Dispatch and Maintenance Control due to the history of it and bring them in the loop. We all agreed that continuing to ZZZ1 was appropriate due to the electric pump picking up the slack. Around 10 minutes later; we step climbed to FL340 as planned. After leveling off at FL340; I allowed the passengers to get up. A few minutes later; we received a flashing right (#2) engine 'oil filter bypass' light. Knowing the possible outcome of this checklist; I gave the radios to the FO and warned that this may lead to a descent/inflight shutdown. I began running the QRH for oil filter bypass; and we realized we were going to need to descend due to the need to reduce the power to the #2 engine. I turned on the seatbelt sign and had the flight attendants take their jumpseats. We were on ZZZ Center; I tried to get their attention for a descent. He was busy with another call so I [advised ATC]. He responded immediately and I asked for a descent. He gave us a descent to FL240 and advised to let him know if we needed anything else. Complying with the QRH; we reduced power to the engine and the oil filter bypass light extinguished. According to the QRH; as long as it remained extinguished and didn't re-appear; we didn't need to run the INFLIGHT ENGINE SHUTDOWN QRH. We knew we were going to be diverting at this point. Around the time I announced that the oil filter bypass QRH was complete; we received more master cautions; this time; the once working system B electric pump. I checked the HYD synoptic and noticed that hydraulic system B had dropped to 0 for quantity and pressure. The FEEL DIFF PRESS; FLT CONTROL SYS B; and associated pump light were illuminated. I ran the QRH for all lights; which included putting the FLT CNTRL SYS B into STBY RUDDER; turning off the associated pump (ELEC 1 on SYS B) and preparing to run the LOSS OF SYS B (MAX) QRH. We [requested priority handling]; and the FO started pulling weather for ZZZ2 and ZZZ3. I conferenced Dispatch and Maintenance Control once again. I advised what had happened and that we were a [priority] aircraft at this point. Looking at alternates; we kept in mind that we were not a 'land at nearest airport'; although we recognized the severity of the situation. Maintenance Control advised that ZZZ3 was best for them; however; the FO and I saw lower ceilings; icing conditions; and wet runways at ZZZ3 and similar at ZZZ2. We had 35000lbs of gas and still needed time to run checklists and brief the flight attendants (FAs). Keeping in mind that we were going to have to alternately extend to flaps 15; loss of certain flight controls/primary braking system; wet runways; and land VREF 15 ICE speeds into ZZZ3. We ultimately agreed that the safest course would be to go to ZZZ4 where there was longer; dry runways; no ice; and more services. It also gave us more time to setup and brief. We finished thedeferred checklists from the LOSS OF SYS B checklist. Slowed below 230 kts. and configured using the alternate extension system early; and eventually swapped controls for the landing. Upon landing; we exited the runway and awaited Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspection. I informed ARFF what had happened asked them to inspect the aircraft for any leaking fluid and/or abnormal conditions. After a moment; the ARFF Operator came on and said he didn't notice any fluid but saw a larger amount of smoke coming from the #2 engine. I advised that it may be due to the hydraulic fluid being dumped into that engine; and it may the source of the smoke. He advised that with the amount of smoke coming from the #2 engine; that he wanted to be safe and advised us that they would be spraying the engine to ensure that the risk of fire was mitigated. Not being able to see it for ourselves; we opted for the safest course of action which was to shut down the #2 engine and follow his recommendations; especially given that he has a much better picture of what's happening down there than we do without being able to see it at the time. They sprayed the engine and confirmed the source of smoke was eliminated. We started the APU and shut down engine #1; ran the supplemental tow-in checklist; and got towed back to the gate. Upon arrival I debriefed with the Chief Pilot; Maintenance Control; Dispatch; and local Maintenance.,B737 MAX 9 flight crew reported hydraulic system malfunction and oil filter bypass issue during cruise. Flight crew diverted and landed safely.

It was the Captain's leg and he briefed that there was roughly 1;000 lbs of fuel in the center tank which may trigger a master caution light on takeoff. He requested that I remind him to turn the center pumps off prior to taking the runway. N1 target was 83.6% per the performance data; the engine instruments were displayed on the right navigation display (it was a Max); and the secondary engine indications were de-cluttered post-engine start. On takeoff; the master caution illuminated at 130 kts. and I called out that it was the center fuel tanks. As we were retracting the gear I smelled something burning and thought that it was one of the ovens in the forward galley. At roughly 400 feet the flight attendants initiated a triple chime and notified us that they smelled something burning. I looked down at the engine fire panel and saw the overheat light was illuminated and then saw that the #1 engine EGT gauge was very high however the digital read-out of the EGT did not have a red box around it indicating an EGT limit exceedance. I notified the Captain that there was an engine overheat and we were simultaneously switched to ZZZ Departure. Passing 4;000 ft. the master warning light; engine fire light; and the engine fire bell indications occurred. We [requested priority handling] and requested a level off at 5;000 ft. with vectors to Runway XXR. ATC amended the vectors for a visual approach to Runway XX. Both engines were providing full thrust; so the engine out (EO) SID did not arm. The Captain continued to fly the aircraft while I executed the QRC and QRH. While running the QRH the Captain directed me to take the aircraft and radios while he continued to run the checklists. We received a descent to 4;000 ft. then a follow-on descent to 3;000 ft. I called for flaps 1 and flaps 5 and loaded ILS XX into the CDU (Control Display Panel) to back up the visual approach. We reported the field in sight and were cleared for the visual Runway XX. I called for gear down; flaps 15; we configured; and the Captain took the landing. The non-normal and normal checklists were complete and we landed below max landing weight without further event. We stopped on the runway; I set flaps 40 and the Captain retracted the speed brakes; and the fire department inspected the #1 engine and brakes while the Captain made a PA to the passengers. The fire department reported no abnormalities and notified us that we were safe to taxi to the gate. We coordinated with operations and ATC to taxi back to Gate XX with the fire department following us. Once shut down the passengers disembarked without event. There was no apparent damage to the #1 engine and there was no red box around the digital EGT display. I believe the causal factor was some type of mechanical failure in the #1 engine. I do not know the nature of the engine malfunction and cannot make meaningful recommendations to mitigate future risk.On debriefing the event we saw that there was an EGT split once TOGA was selected; with the left side reading 999 and the right side reading 827. I was focused on the N1 gauges to ensure that the proper thrust setting was achieved and then shifted my focus to the Primary Flight Display (PFD) to monitor the takeoff and make the appropriate pilot monitoring (PM) callouts. The digital EGT gauge did not illuminate red indicating an over-temperature condition so I did not realize the #1 engine was running hot. I believe I misdiagnosed the master caution at 130 kts. due to a combination of expectation bias and difficulty seeing the overheat light from the right seat (it is partially masked by the #1 engine fire handle) during a critical phase of flight. Had I noticed the over-temperature while still on the runway I do not believe we would have initiated a rejected takeoff as we were in the high-speed rejection regime with little time remaining. Having an EICAS would have likely prevented themisdiagnosis however I do not believe it is not likely to be changed on the 737. From now on I will include EGT in my scan as pilot monitoring (PM) when takeoff thrust is set. I do not believe this was a causal factor but it is my main lesson learned from the event.,B737 MAX 8 flight crew reported they received an engine overheat and engine fire warning on initial climb. Flight crew returned to departure airport.

Passing 5000 I witnessed the right engine oil qty plummet to 2 qts then bounce between1 - 3 qts.  The white title on the engine system page started flashing and the quantity periodically showed amber xx's but hovered around 1 qt.  We coordinated with ATC to halt the climb at 6000 ft and to put us in a box pattern so we didn't get too far from the airport in the event engine 2 failed.  We coordinated with dispatch on a precautionary return to ZZZ as opposed to continuing 3 hrs to ZZZ1 with the continued indications on Engine 2 and the uncertainty of the oil status. [Priority handling was requested]; ATC was given the necessary information and we prepared the aircraft to return to ZZZ for a landing on runway XYL.  The FAs were given all the appropriate briefing information and then passengers were briefed accordingly.  As we had no ECAM procedure to follow and there is no QRH procedure for the situation and the engine oil temp was not showing an overheat and had pressure plus still generating thrust we elected to leave it running until instructed to shut it down - engine 2.  Additionally as we were slightly over the max landing weight we performed the 'Landing Overweight' QRH checklist.  Dispatch provided us with the necessary landing data and we proceeded to land uneventfully on runway XYL the taxied to gate XX without any further incident.  Upon arriving at the gate we conferred with Maintenance and entered the appropriate electronic logbook report.  Finally we debriefed with a company representative performing the human factors checklist then debriefed as a crew.,A320 flight crew reported a drop in the right engine oil quantity shortly after takeoff; resulting in a return to the departure airport.

Specifically; as we configured with flaps; the max maneuver/min maneuver speed bands converged with corresponding max/stall speed bars also converging on both Primary Flight Displays (PFDs). No 'IAS DISAGREE' msg; however I was unable to engage VNAV when cleared and as the bands converged it became apparent that we had a problem. I disconnected autopilot and around 2600' initiated a soft go around. As I was concerned with our stall margin; I did not change configuration until I was safely in climb with speed increasing. Our airspeeds were in sync with each other and the groundspeed so at that point I then performed full go around maneuver. We [requested priority handling] and once above the clouds I directed FO to the airspeed unreliable checklist. I suspected that icing was the culprit and as the FO ran the checklist we concurred that our airspeeds were accurate and it was likely an indication problem with our speed warning systems due to the icing. Both of our alternates had been reported as overcast (OVC); so we decided to reattempt an approach to ZZZ and requested vectors again for the ILS XXL. This time; I disengaged both the autothrottle/autopilot for the approach and asked the FO to monitor all airspeeds and call out anything less than 160kts(vref was 148). I flew the approach maintaining a higher than normal speed to stay above the min maneuver band. Since the Airspeed (AS) unreliable checklist didn't exactly reflect our situation; I decided that during the approach any stall warning indications would be respected. At some point during the approach we got the 'Leading Edge (LE) FLAPS TRANSIT' light on. As far as I know; we never exceeded any flap speeds or aircraft limits during the event. We landed; left the flaps down and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting inspect the aircraft; particularly our flight controls because we still had transit light. Everything appeared normal and we proceeded to our gate. Postflight inspection revealed some rime ice on the Leading Edge Devices (LEDs) and Maintenance discovered icing in the slat tracks. Cause: Icing. We had covered it in our brief and selected engine anti-ice but I never considered turning on the wing anti-ice and in retrospect realize that it may have mitigated some of our issues. Wing anti-ice is used so rarely that I tend to focus on the restrictions/limitations over the reasons to use it. Not anymore!                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Time. After [requesting priority handling] I felt time constrained because in the back of my mind I was concerned about our plan B. I knew the ceiling/vis should not be a problem getting into ZZZ; but was not sure how far we might need to go if we couldn't safely get below the OVC layer and needed an alternate with no ice on the arrival. In the rush to get back into the approach I did not give the Flight Attendants (FAs) a precautionary landing brief. I also opted to continue the approach with the transit light on because we knew it was icing related and that would take several minutes of checklist.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Checklist. The airspeed unreliable checklist was our initial response to the indications; however the checklist does not consider an event that presents initially as unreliable airspeed but then once checklist is completed we still encounter PFD speed warnings anomalies. I would recommend a decision tree that considers if all airspeed indications are accurate; that icing accumulation may be a factor and direct accordingly with winganti-ice and speed additives for approach.,A B737-800 pilot reported unreliable airspeed indications due to icing during initial approach. Flight crew went around and landed safely.

I noticed the odor was like a plastic/rubber smell but it went away as the pilots started the engines. We performed the safety demonstration and when I came back I noticed the smell. As we sat down for takeoff my FA #4 asked if she could turn off the coffee pot warmers and I told her yes."" At that point I figured the smell came from the coffee pot warmers as sometimes coffee spills on that metal hot plate. As we were getting ready for the service I noticed the smell but since we had turned on the warmers and started brewing the coffee didn't think too much of it. We did the service and noticed it as we got back to the galley. After we picked up the trash I sat down and ate. After like 5 minutes my FA #4 comes to me and asks if I can smell a rubbery/plastic smell. I told her I did and at that point it was stronger. She went up and told the FA #1 so at that point FA #1 came to the back to assess. She smelled it 3 to 4 rows from the back galley; it got stronger as she went into the back galley; and she saw a haze in the galley. At that point she informed the Captain and he advised us to turn everything off and wait 10 minutes to see if the odor subsided and to keep him informed.At that point I became used to the odor and could not smell it anymore but my FA #1 was still smelling it. The FA #3 came to the back and she noticed the odor 3 to 4 rows from the back galley as well. At this point the Captain decided we were going to make a rapid descent and do a [priority handling] landing into ZZZ with emergency vehicles meeting the aircraft as a precaution he did not want to take any chances in case there was something else going on that we could not see. We made the [priority handling] landing; ZZZ emergency vehicles assessed the aircraft using heat detection equipment; and they proceeded to follow us to the terminal. The odor did dissipate as we got on the ground. About 45 minutes before landing I started to get a headache rating a 6 from a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being mild and 10 being severe); very dry eyes; and exhausted/tired feeling. The Captain told us this was going to be written as a fume/odor event; Maintenance came and talked to each one of us; then a ZZZ Manager talked to us. He asked how we're feeling - 3 of us had headaches; red eyes; and exhaustion. He advised us we could go straight to our layover hotel or we can go to the hospital to get blood work done for carbon monoxide poisoning. When we decided we were going to the hospital to get tested whoever he was talking to on the other side was not happy with the response we gave him it almost seems like they were disregarding the entire fume event. We proceeded to the hospital via rideshare after being on the phone for 30 minutes just to file a report and start the process.Fume events NEED to be handled differently and faster. This whole calling to file a report to talk to a nurse to assess AND then we choose whether or not we want to go to the hospital based on nurse recommendations should NOT be handled like this! So much time wasted ESPECIALLY when we have a 4-hour window to get blood drawn! There needs to be a faster way to get this done. Furthermore the attitudes from managers is NOT appreciated especially when we tell them what our symptoms are! In addition; having to call out sick; then file a report; and then get it recategorized should not be the case; it almost seems like we are getting penalized for even reporting a fume event. The fact that if we had worse symptoms; having to worry if we would be pay protected for the trip since we were working and having to a get ""sick"" before we file to get it recategorized SHOULD NOT have to be this way at all; the airlines' priority should be for us not to worry about that and make a seamless process. Fix this process and make it BLACKAND WHITE!""",B737-800 Flight Attendant reported a fume event that occurred inflight and the Captain diverted to a nearby airport. The flight crew were then assessed and tested due to the presence of physiological symptoms.

The Captain served as the flying pilot; while the First Officer acted as the monitoring pilot. Upon climbing through Flight Level 330; I noticed the cabin altitude flashing; indicating a pressure altitude of approximately 9;200 feet. We initially requested to level off but then opted for a descent to 31;000 feet. As cabin pressure continued to rise; we informed ATC of a cabin pressurization issue and requested a lower altitude to resolve the problem. We were assigned Flight Level 270; at which point I donned my oxygen mask and called for the Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) for high cabin pressure; specifically CAB PR EXCESSIVE CABIN ALT.During our descent to 270; we received an ECAM notification for excessive cabin altitude. We completed the memory items; and I called for the Emergency Descent QRC. We requested a descent and were initially cleared to Flight Level 200. As we descended; I asked the First Officer for the nearest airport. He mentioned ZZZ1 and ZZZ. I decided to divert to ZZZ and asked him to coordinate the change in destination and request a lower altitude. We were subsequently assigned 17;000 feet.As we descended to 17;000 feet; cabin pressure began to recover and normalize. We informed ATC that our cabin pressure was normal and requested to maintain 17;000 feet. We were approximately 180 miles from ZZZ. We completed the QRC and QRH procedures for the non-normal situation as outlined in QRH. We determined that an overweight landing was unnecessary and then swapped control of the aircraft.I first called the inflight crew to update them on our situation; instructing them to discontinue service and prepare the cabin for landing in about 20 minutes. I then contacted our dispatcher via satellite phone to report the pressurization issue and our diversion to ZZZ. While on the call; she connected me with our maintenance controller; and I briefed them on our situation and intentions. The approach and landing were uneventful. We landed at approximately XA:00; but a gate was not available until XB:30.Upon arrival; we were met by the emergency response team in ZZZ; and we informed them that no further assistance was needed. When the gate became available; we taxied to it and disembarked the passengers.On the previous flight; there was a write up for pressurization. Left aft service door; found by contract maintenance in ZZZ. There was also evidence found in ZZZ the door seals were excessively lubed.,Air carrier flight crew flying A321 aircraft reported pressurization malfunction. Flight crew diverted and landed uneventfully.

I tried the electric stab trim on my side and confirmed it was not working. I did a quick scan to verify all switches were in their appropriate position and then told ATC we needed delay vectors and would likely be remaining in the area. I then went to the QRH and accomplished the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist. Realizing we would not have electric stab trim and would perform a flaps 15 landing; we elected to [request priority handling] and divert to ZZZ1 airport. I then made a call to Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Dispatch had nothing to say; and Maintenance Control concurred they could do nothing to help us troubleshoot while airborne. Next; I completed the Non-routine Landing Checklist including ATC; Company; Cabin call; and Passenger PA. Then I completed the overweight landing checklist. We ask for a 20 mile final; the ILS to XXL; and alternated missed approach instructions and that crash fire and rescue be present upon landing. All was approved; and alternate missed was heading 220 as soon as able to 3000 feet. Finally; I set up and briefed the ILS to XXL; highlighting the threats of flap 15 landing; and overweight landing. We were cleared for the ILS; and landed softly and stopped on the runway without further incident. We asked to taxi clear and for crash fire and rescue to inspect the aircraft and brakes for any evidence of damage or fire. Crash fire and rescue noted no apparent damage and no evidence of fire. We asked them to follow us to the gate; when they called clear we taxied to the gate with no further issues.No causal factors are evident; all normal checklists and procedures were accomplished prior to the trim failure. Stab trim was set normally; for takeoff during setup.,B737-800 flight crew reported an electric stabilizer trim failure during climb. The flight crew diverted to an alternate airport with longer runways and landed overweight.

We were unable to set the barometric altimeter to local settings. Within 5 minutes while running ECAM and checklists we received a further ECAM alert of auto pilot off; auto thrust off; and auto flight FCU 1+2 Fault. We leveled at 6000 and began to run checklists for the new ECAM faults. I observed that I was down to the basics of flight instrumentation; with no Flight Director; and only the bird"" for flight guidance. The standby altimeter was the closest to reasonable altitude. I had the airport in sight and good visibility. The sun was setting and I was not interested in a night time landing with only basic instrumentation. I [requested priority handling] and requested a visual approach to Runway XX. With airspeed callouts from my FO; I made the visual approach and landed Runway XX without incident. Local emergency equipment followed us to the gate.Cause: Double FCU unit failure resulting in loss of Auto pilot; auto thrust; basic Flight Director and unreliable altimeter setting.  [Requested priority handling] and a visual approach conducted to the runway.  No suggestions to mitigate risks.""",A319 Captain reported a double Flight Control Unit failure during descent. With only basic flight instruments and standby altimeter available; crew performed a visual approach and landing.

Pushback; taxi out to Runway XXL at ZZZ was uneventful and normal. On climb out at approximately 9000 feet with the autopilots engaged; I noticed and felt the #2 engine rolling back and the REV amber light came on. I do not recall even getting a Master Caution though. I brought it to my FO's attention and announced My aircraft"". I turned off the autopilot and autothrottles so that I could have a better feel as to what was going on. The FO [requested priority handling] and he advised ATC we had something going on with our #2 engine and that we would be leveling at 10;000 feet to run some checklists. The engine was somewhat cycling or surging if the throttle was not at idle as the FADEC (Full Authority Digital Electronic Control) took control. I remained Pilot Flying while my FO went to the QRH checklist for REV (Reverser unlocked in flight) checklist. We both agreed that was the appropriate checklist and we accomplished that first. With the current indications and responses from the engine; we were directed to the ""Engine failure or Shutdown checklist"".That checklist was accomplished and we shut down the #2 engine and followed the remaining procedures. We still had some time before getting a returning vector back to ZZZ so I transferred control to the FO and accomplished the ""Non routine landing  considerations"" items Telling the FAs (Flight Attendants) our plan; telling the people a short summary; and finally sending the ACARS message to Dispatch. ATC had already been told we wanted Runway XXC in ZZZ and we began our vectoring back to an uneventful overweight single engine landing in ZZZ. As advertised; safety equipment was waiting for us as we turned on Taxiway 1 and stopped facing south on Taxiway 2. I made a PA to the passengers that we would be stopping for the safety equipment to give us a quick look over and to remain seated until we were back at the gate. We asked the Fire detail to look at our #2 engine for any visible leaks or damage which would prohibit us from taxiing to the gate. They indicated that everything looked ok and at that point we taxied to Gate XX. Parking and shutdown was uneventful and normal. I made an entry in the logbook. Maintenance met us shortly after and queried what we experienced and what we saw with the engine and told us they'd be taking it to the hanger.""",B737-800 Captain reported engine failure along with FADEC and reverser lockout malfunctions during climb that resulted in a return to the departure airport.

I was flying with Captain. We are both ZZZ1 based pilots on the 737. Aircraft X was the last leg of a two-day trip.The sequence was very routine in nature. The inbound flight was delayed coming into ZZZ which obviously delayed our outbound flight. We were flying Aircraft X; which had MEL 49-XXX; for the APU BLEED AIR VALVE. Once we completed our preflight checks and were boarded; we conducted the supplementary procedure per the AOM for engine start. Other than the supplementary start procedure; it was just a routine push back and taxi. It was the captain's leg to fly; and we took off XXL out of ZZZ. Somewhere; around 9000-9500 feet; the captain noticed something wrong with the aircraft. It was at this point that I noticed the indication showing the #2 ENG REV was illuminated; with a loss of thrust on the #2 ENG; and the #2 throttle did not move via auto throttle. I believe the #2 EEC (Electronic Engine Control) took over the #2 ENG thrust when the Reverser indication illuminated; but I am not sure. The captain continued to fly the aircraft while I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ departure; requesting a level off at 10;000 feet and a heading; with an intent to return to ZZZ airport; and requested them to stand by while we figured out the issue and ran some checklists. Over the next few minutes; the #2 ENG REV indication did go away which then was accompanied by an increase in thrust to what was being commanded by the position of the #2 throttle; I believe. Once the #2 ENG spooled up; the #2 ENG REV indication re-illuminated; and accompanying loss of thrust on the #2 ENG. The cycle repeated itself maybe 2 or 3 times. There was a noticeable yaw in the aircraft but was controlled the captain flying. While this was going on I opened the electronic QRH in Comply; I did make a mistake opened the REVERSER 7.XX checklist; but quickly noticed my mistake as that was for ground operations; and then opened the correct REV 7.XY checklist. The captain continued to fly while I read the checklist. This then led us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist. It was around this time we began a decent to 8000 feet I believe. I then ran the Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist which we completed for the #2 ENG. Once completed; I then ran the One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist; referencing how much landing distance would be required at which point I noted that it would additionally be an overweight landing. Once these were completed prior to the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist being completed; the captain and I swapped pilot flying duties vs pilot monitoring duties. The captain then notified dispatch of the issue; the flight attendants and the passengers on the situation and that we would be returning to ZZZ. During this time; I also began set up and reviewing for an approach to ILS XXC back into ZZZ. It was around this time I stated to ATC; Fuel on board; Passengers on board and the nature of the [situation] as well as stating we could begin our arrival into ZZZ. ATC gave us headings to complete a 360 degree turn prior joining XXC LOC.  It was around this time to the best of my recollection that the captain requested the aircraft back; and we swapped pilot flying vs pilot monitoring duties. I then ran the Non-Routine Landing Considerations checklist; as well as the Overweight Landing checklist. Once completed; we reviewed the approach plate for ILS XXC into ZZZ; as well as running the Before Landing Checklist. It was around this time we intercepted the XXC course for landing and began our approach. Once closer to the runway; I noticed ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting] and emergency response vehicles parked on the adjacent taxiways to XXC which then followed our aircraft after exiting the runway taxiway 1 off XXC. Once stopped; the captain requested the passengers remain seated while I communicated to ARFF command; requesting an inspection of the #2 ENG for any abnormalities. Once; the inspection was completed and they stated they didn't see any abnormalities; we cancelled out [priority handling] status. I then coordinated with ZZZ Company operations for an arrival gate of XX. The captain then began to taxi the aircraft towards XX with ZZZ ground instructions while I called the flights attendants and confirmed everyone was ok and that we would be going to Gate XX. Once; at the gate we completed the shutdown checklist. The captain made a logbook entry for the incident. He then spoke to the director. At which point we then booked tickets on the next ZZZ-ZZZ1 flight home as we had already gone over our over time for the day. This statement is the best recollection I have of the events as they happened for Aircraft X. I do believe the crew; as a whole; did an amazing job and I was fortunate to have completed my annual recurrent training recently; which made me feel that I had recency in dealing with [a situation] of this type. I do believe my Company has a great training program with knowledgeable individuals coming together to train us for when a situation like this arises.  No recommendations. Company has a great training program.,B737-800 First Officer reported engine failure with FADEC and reverser lockout malfunction resulted in an expeditious return to departure airport to an overweight landing.

The Captain turned down the temp controllers more and more after each call; eventually turning them to full cold. The aft temp display in the cockpit showed the temperature dropping; but the flight attendants kept telling us that the temperature in back hadn't dropped at all. The Captain had looked through our manuals but found no set procedure for such an incident.On our descent into ZZZ; perhaps near ZZZZZ intersection on the ZZZZZ1X arrival (possibly closer to the airport as we were getting handed off to ZZZ Approach); the Flight Attendant (FA) called to tell us that a woman was overheating and requested EMTs at the gate. There were no medical professionals onboard. The Captain turned off the Hot Air switch and the plane began to cool down a bit. We then [requested priority handling] and were given Runway XXR and an expedited taxi to the gate. The lady walked off under her own power and the EMTs took it from there. No further issues.A similar issue had been previously reported but was not on MEL as far as I can recall. The temperature sensors were not giving correct info to the cockpit display.,A319 First Officer reported high temperatures in aircraft cabin with a passenger overcome by heat. Captain selected 'Hot Air' switch to off and cabin cooled slightly.
