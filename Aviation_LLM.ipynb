I asked what it smelled like and if they could figure out the location. They could not and on the flight deck only smelled it faintly after several minutes. By the time we smelled it in the flight deck the Flight Attendants called back and said it was gone. Over the next several minutes we discussed what we thought it smelled like and I began to look up ZZZZZ frequency so I could give the company a heads up. Before I could make the call we received a call from the Flight Attendants letting us know the smell came back and were in the process of trying to locate the origin. I again asked them what they thought it smelled like and at that point; it became very pronounced on the flight deck. It was a strong burning plastic mixed with an electrical odor. At that point we performed immediate action items for smoke; fire; fumes by donning our masks and establishing communication. The FO (First Officer) took over the radios while I continued with the checklist and called the Flight Attendants. The FO told ATC we needed lower. He informed them we had smoke on the flight deck and [requested priority handling]. Shortly after I informed ATC it was actually fumes on the flight deck not smoke. At first he asked for vectors to ZZZ but after getting the weather we decided ZZZ1 was a better option. I continued with as much of the checklist as I could. I called the Flight Attendants to let them know we would be on the ground in less then 10 minutes and made an announcement to the passengers. A landing was performed in ZZZ1 on Runway XX. We stopped on the runway and had the fire trucks do a visual inspection. They saw nothing out of the ordinary.

            "Narrative: all flight events and procedures that occurred prior to calling for gear extension were normal. the descent and approach were briefed per normal procedure. the fo first officer was the pilot flying pf captain was pilot monitoring pm there was no jumpseater or other flight deck crew members present. the predeparture briefing included duties in case of abnormal operations or emergency  pf would continue to fly the aircraft and take the radios pm would run any required checklists. goaround procedures were briefed during the descent briefing. the approach was planned as a normal zzz ils xxr in visual gustywind conditions.at approximately xa00 on day 0 the flight was approaching zzzzz  zzz ils xxr final approach fix  at approximately 1800 ft. agl. as briefed the fo called for gear extension and setting flaps 15. the gear extension sounded normal at first. however both pilots observed abnormal landing gear position light indications. the following indications were noted all three green landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. all three green landing gear indicator lights on the aft overhead panel were illuminated. all three red landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. a single unfamiliar tone  beep  sounded briefly.unsure of what may have caused the abnormal landing gear position indications and the unfamiliar tone  neither the pm nor the pf had heard this tone before  the pm suggested a goaround from the current altitude and the pf called for the goaround and started the procedures as briefed. atc stated aircraft x go around runway heading climb and maintain 3000 ft. the first half  i.e. toga engagement raising flaps to 15 which we were already positioned at checking thrust raising gear and setting missed approach altitude  of the goaround was conducted normally. at this time atc started calling to ask about the reason for the goaround. this interrupted the goaround procedure. approximately 30 seconds later as the aircraft was accelerating the remaining procedures were accomplished  heading select level change setting clean maneuvering speed raising flaps to 0 aftertakeoff checklist. allowing the atc interruption and subsequent delay was pilotcrew error. however the procedures were accomplished fully and safely.after goaround procedures were accomplished and the aircraft was overflying the zzz field during the field overflight the tower reported that the aircrafts left main gear appeared to be extended while all other gear appeared retracted. all landing gear indicators on the flight deck appeared normal i.e. there were no red or green gear lights illuminated. the crew had no way to confirm whether or not the left main gear was extended. atc queried the crew as to what airspace was required to resolve the issue. the pm requested vectors to remain in the local area and atc vectored the flight west and directed a climb to 5000 ft. msl. the pf engaged the autopilot and maintained 230 kias via the mcp mode control panel speed window.during the vector the pf selected vnav instead of continuing the lvl chg climb. this caused the aircraft to start a brief descent while it attempted to recapture the cruise altitude in the fmc. the issue was identified by the pf who disconnected the autopilot and set the desired pitch attitude for the climb followed by requesting reengagement of lvl chg which was accomplished by the pm. the pf then reengaged the autopilot.the pm started to run ng gear disagree checklist. the pf coordinated vectors with atc and confirmed altitude and heading changes with the pm. while running the checklist the pm step 1  landing gear lever is off. step 2  landing gear lever moved to the up position after takeoff goaround. step 3  235 kias maximum landing gear lever up. step 4  all red and green landing gear indicator lights are extinguished. end of the checklist.pmthen determined that no additional resolution was available. we as a crew discussed if we should request priority handling but it was decided that we had time and fuel 14400 lb. left to continue to work on the problem. so we opted not to request priority handling at that time. however atc then asked us souls on board and fuel remaining so we provided them with the information of sob and 14400 lb. of fuel remaining or 144 minutes of flight time available. they essentially provided priority handling for us. since we had no indication if our left main gear was still extended or not like the zzz tower had told us it was the crew then decided to contact a company ground agency for any potential assistance or information they could provide. the pm contacted company zzz operations who then directed us to contact company zzz maintenance. the maintenance personnel suggested cycling the manual gear extension door located behind the fo on the floor open and closed as well as check for any popped circuit breakers. no additional resolution was gained as all landing gear indicator lights were still extinguished. while the pm was communicating with maintenance atc contacted the pf and suggested the flight overfly zzz1 airport where tower personnel could examine the gear positions with binoculars. the pf agreed and accepted vectors toward zzz1. when the pm was available the pf briefed the pm on the plan to have zzz1 personnel visually inspect the gear. the pm agreed then briefed the purser and made a short announcement to the passengers.once the pm confirmed checklist usage complete maintenance agreed with the plan to overfly zzz1 and extend the gear. the pf accepted a descent to 2000 ft. msl and continued toward zzz1. approaching zzz1 the pf extended the gear with pm concurrence. the aircraft was at 230 kias. the gear extension appeared normal both in sound and landing gear light indicator illumination sequence. when complete there were three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the instrument panel three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the aft overhead panel and zero red landing gear indicator lights illuminated. the aircraft overflew zzz1 at 2000 ft. msl and in a right turn toward the south. through zzz approach control zzz1 tower personnel reported that all three landing gear appeared to be down. at this time ground  maintenance communications were called complete.with normal gear indications on the flight deck and visual confirmation from zzz1 tower the pf and pm decided that the gear would remain down for the remainder of the flight. at this point the crew discussed and determined the following all applicable checklists were run. both flight crew members were comfortable moving into the approach  landing phase. the pf would continue to fly the aircraft. call to purser to rebrief the flight attendants on the situation and to not plan for an evacuation.the pf then requested and accepted vectors for the zzz ils xxr. the pm reloaded the approach into the fmc and the pf called for the descent checklist. the localizer was intercepted between zzzzz1 and zzzzz. the remainder of the flight including approach landing and taxiin were uneventful. during the approach it was apparent that atc most likely tower personnel provided us priority handling and made airport rescue and firefighting arff vehicles available. additionally on short final zzz tower personnel confirmed that all three gear appeared to be down. arff vehicles and equipment followed us to the gate area.after parking shutting down the aircraft and conducting a short crewonly debrief  which focused on the goaround procedures and checklist usage  the flight crew was met by two zzz assistant chief pilots person a and person b and one company maintenance representative. the flight crew was fully debriefed by maintenance and other personnel. the pf entered an electronic logbook entry to document theevent.\n",

            "Narrative: immediately after takeoff from zzz i was sitting in back as the b position flight attendant and i smelt fumes that i had never smelled in my entire career before. i jumped out of my jump seat to investigate where the origin of the fumes may be coming from and looked out passenger window to make certain the engines were not on fire even though this smell was not of that nature. i didnt see anything. i did not see any smoke. i tried to locate the source of fumes by smelling the vents in galley and lavatory as well but found nothing. i looked to forward cabin and noticed the c flight attendant motioning me to pick up the handset. i picked up the handset and she told me she smelled fumes up front cabin as well. with the two of us on the handset we called the captain and he also confirmed that the pilots both smelled the fumes up in cockpit as well. he told us if the fumes got any worse to call him back. within a minute or two later i couldnt breathe in the back cabin and was chugging water to keep my throat open to even breathe. i also got wet paper towels to cover my nose and mouth even though i could not see fumes. my throat and chest were burning and i had a pounding headache and was coughing profusely. i immediately called the captain and told him what was happening and he told me that they were already in an priority landing pattern back into zzz and it would be another 510 before we were back on the ground. before our captain made an announcement to our passengers i noticed that some of our passengers had emergency briefing cards already in their laps. we were back on ground in zzz about 10 minutes later. we stopped abruptly on the runway and were surrounded by many emergency vehicles. our captain made announcements to all passengers to remain seated loudly 4 times and listen to the commands of the flight attendants. we ended up going back to gate and deplaning all passengers at gate. the fire department came onboard and checked out the aircraft after we exited the aircraft. as a crew we all were feeling horrible and many symptoms and all the same symptoms simultaneously. headache nausea burning in throat burning in chest dizziness faint shortness of breath coughing numbness in extremities etc. our captain had the entire crew pulled from the flight duties and we all went to the hospital together to get checked out medically for anything we may have ingested as far as fumes that were making us feel so poorly. i do not know how the passengers were treated in regards to this situation. i commend the captain and first officer both on how they handled this situation. they were both remarkable.\n",

            "Narrative: at cruise on aircraft x at 35000ft mach .78 and smooth ride conditions we encountered an aggressive yawing moment to the left estimating 45 degrees.  the first officer and i would describe the abnormality as if you were to abruptly step on the left rudder pedal and create a quick hard yaw to the left. there were no ecam notifications and we checked that there were no abnormalities to any of the system pages.  the only normal indication we noticed was whenever the aircraft yawed to the left the rudder on the flight control page respectively moved with it.  the yawing moment started out with a frequency of every 1015 seconds and our concern grew as the frequency became closer together.  the first officer took over the flight controls and radios and i called dispatch to notify them of the abnormality.  they instructed us to check both autopilots and manual flight and unfortunately the condition continued.  after disconnecting with dispatch the frequency continued and we decided the safest option was to divert to the closest airport.  i spoke with flight attendants asking if they felt the disturbance and they said they felt it but wasnt that aggressive in the cabin.  zzz was roughly 5060nm off our nose so we started the diversion by notifying atc going through the diversion checklist notifying dispatch via acars setting up for the approach notifying the customers and briefing the flight attendants if condition escalated.  due to it not being a flight control malfunction we did not request priority handling but notified atc that it was an abnormality and we wanted cfr crash fire rescue as a precaution.  we landed with no incident and taxied safely to the gate in zzz.\n",

            "Narrative: atis reported low level windshear therefore we selected windshear profile. after takeoff at approximately 300 ft. to 400 ft. i noticed the 1 engine egt went red and indicated 968 degrees. i incorrectly stated we had an engine overheat because i saw the high egt. at 1000 ft. after cleaning up the aircraft i asked the fo first officer to pull out the qrh for engine overheat and as he looked at the index he realized that it was a qrc item as was the checklist we should have run engine limit or surge or stall. we ran the engine overheat qrc and qrh. everything with the wrong qrcqrh went as i was expecting with the one exception of it having us retard the thrust lever all the way to idle rather than to the point where the indication went away as i was expecting however i clarified with the fo that that was what it said and we again failed to trap the error. the red indication went away shortly after reducing the thrust lever. we informed tower we would be returning to zzz due to a malfunction with our 1 engine. i notified the flight attendants of the situation and that we did not anticipate an evacuation. i sent an acars message to dispatch to let them know of the situation and that we were returning to zzz. i also requested that they get us a gate. we had requested with atc slightly extended vectors to runway xx in order to accomplish all the nonnormal and normal checklists and to set up and brief the approach and landing. we requested priority handling with atc so that the crash fire rescue would be on hand in case we had any further engine trouble and due to the fact that we would be landing overweight in a high ambient temperature of 99 degrees f. we decided to perform a 15 flap landing in case we had to go around and had any further trouble with the 1 engine especially due to the high ambient temperature with a fully loaded aircraft. we also elected to use autobrakes 3. the landing was smooth and we rolled out to taxiway 1 at towers request so that we could pull off into the deice pad for the fire trucks to inspect the aircraft. we ran the brake cooling performance data. we had to allow 30 minutes of cooling before returning to the gate. we coordinated with crash fire rescue to shut down the engines so that they could chock the nose wheel for us to release the parking brake and help with brake cooling. at this point we debriefed how we handled anything and as we reviewed the qrh again on the ground the fo noticed that the indications section of the qrh showed the engine overheat lights and that that did not match our situation. this is when we realized we should have run the engine limit or surge or stall qrc and qrh. after the 30 minutes brake cooling we coordinated to have the chocks removed and restarted the 2 engine. crash fire rescue followed us taxiing. we ensured ground personnel would be aware that 2 engine would be running instead of the usual 1 engine until we were stopped at the gate.after selecting the wrong qrc and continuing into the qrh we should have reverified the indications shown above the qrh steps. this would have shown us that we were in the wrong checklist. additionally i should have queried more than i did when i felt that retarding the thrust lever to idle rather than just until the indication went away. i should have had us reverify the indicationscondition section of the qrh. lastly i think consideration should be given to removing these two emergency checklists from the qrc and to only have them in the qrh. this would drive the first actions we take to be verifying the indications prior to following an initial wrong selection that gets us headed down the wrong path. alternatively i think adding the indications to the qrc would help limit this kind of error.\n",

            "Narrative: i was the captain. preflight preparation pushback startup and taxi out were uneventful. we took off on runway xx with a flaps 5 setting. climb out to fl340 was also uneventful. approximately 40 minutes after takeoff we got a c hyd qty eicas message. we pulled up the status page and noticed that the center hydraulic quantity was at .43 and decreasing rapidly. the first officer pulled out the qrh and ipad and referenced the procedures for this anomaly. the center pumps both electric and the demand pumps were secured. this slowed the quantity decrease but did not stop it. i initiated a satcom call to dispatch and was eventually conferenced in with maintenance the operations and the 756 fleet guys. a detailed discussion ensued covering all implications of continuing the flight or turning around and returning to zzzz or another suitable divert aerodrome. the divert option was eventually ruled out as it would involve fuel dumping 13000 available to dump and at least two hours of loitering to burn down to max landing weight for the 767300. my concerns about the legality of continuing an etops flight without the center system and associated loss of our hmg hydraulic motor generator were assuaged and we collectively internal flight crew and external resources decided to continue the crossing. the flight proceeded normally until approaching zzz. i was on third break and returned to the cockpit approximately 50 minutes before scheduled landing. the center system quantity at this point was .11. the three of us discussed all possible scenarios again and we began our descent. when we checked in with approach we advised atc and requested the ils to xxr so as not to interrupt normal operations on the center and left runways. this also gave us potential maneuvering airspace on the less congested side of the airport.at 6000 ft. and about 35 miles from the approach end of xxr we ran the checklist items. we were reasonably certain that the center system would not work due to the spoiler eicas when i deployed speed brakes on the descent. when the demand pump was turned on the center pressure lights remained on so we continued the applicable checklist. we had slowed to 220 knots clean maneuvering and began to bring the flaps down via the alternate method. as the flaps transited from 0 to 1 we got a le slats asymmetry eicas and the flaps stopped moving. we were now around 22 miles from the runway and still at 220 knots. we informed tower that we might have to execute a 360 degree turn to work the additional emergency of split slats. we had also lost the left yaw damper earlier in the flight. the relief pilot was working the le slats problem while we continued the alternate flap problem. i called for the alternate gear extension at some point in this process and the gear came down and locked as advertised. i asked the pm pilot monitoring to select flaps 5 on the alternate switch and around 12 miles from touchdown the flaps began to move again but still with the asymmetry indication. i asked the relief pilot if that was going to be a problem and he said not if the flaps come down. we continued to dial the speed back as the flaps came down and after almost 6 minutes from alternate flap initiation and at approximately 810 miles we got the aircraft at flaps 20 and target speed 150 ref 144  6 knots for the wind 12012.i disengaged the auto flight at 1500 ft. and flew a normal approach to touch down on xxr. we exited the runway and with the reserve steering and brakes switch engaged had enough standpipe pressure to clear the runway using nose wheel steering. emergency responders were there immediately and confirmed that we still had hydraulic fluid leaking from the port wheel well area and we soon had zero center quantity as the remaining fluid leaked out. a tug eventually came and towed us to our gate. i would like to say that this was a textbook collaboration of resources both internal cockpit and cabin and external. we worked as a team and resolved what could have been a serious emergency. i kept the pursuer engaged from soon after the caution light until after landing. i did not ask that the cabin be prepared for evacuation due to the nature of the problem and only an extra 810 knot approach speed expected. although i didnt use the term cabin advisory the words i used when briefing her were reflective of that process. tip of the hat to all involved and 220 souls on board were happy to have landed safely.\n",

            "Narrative: about halfway through cruise at 38000 feet the captain and i noticed some very subtle but different feeling vibration in the flight deck. we reviewed the n1n2 vibration indicators and they were well within the normal range. i suggested to the captain that the vibration may be happening from something other than the engines. the captain suggested that we review the vibration advisory in the qrh. we reviewed the qrh regarding engine vibration and noted what to do in the event we had excessive engine vibration. the procedure was not needed under these specific conditions.the vibration was intermittent and hard to concretely sense it was really any concern. however we did for our own interest review nearest airport options in case the vibration became significant.the vibration ended and we didnt discuss more about it. then about 1015 minutes later i smelled a burning smell towards the rudder pedals. it had the smell of something similar to when you light a match. i also felt some heat from the fumes. i advised the captain that i believed we had smoke in the flight deck and we immediately donned our air masks. we then called the fas flight attendants and they reported that they did not smell any smoke. we advised the fas that we were keeping our masks on for now because we smelled smoke.  the captain and i were slightly surprised that the fas did not smell anything because we were still smelling smoke. so to troubleshoot we decided to look at all of our peds personal devices to see if anything was burning. peds were fine. while keeping the masks on we did each take them off briefly to confirm we still had a burning smell which we did.there were no indications from any of our instrumentation and advisory system screens that anything out of the ordinary was going on. but i had no confidence that the burning smell was going to end. rather i was concerned that that situation was going to escalate from a burning smell to a fire. i shared my concerns with the captain and that i felt we needed to divert to zzz we were about 1015 minutes from top of descent to original destination if the smell persisted for 2 more minutes and he agreed. the smell persisted we advised center that we needed to divert to zzz. they gave us vectors direct and to descend to 16000 ft. we then advised the flight attendants we were diverting to zzz because we kept smelling a burning smell in the flight deck.shortly after we started our descent the fas advised us that they also had a noticeable burning smell from the exit row up to the flight deck. upon receiving this information the captain and i concurred that we should advise atc for priority into zzz and to have firerescue at the field. later we would also learn that there was a first officer in row 17 who also noticed a burning smell while were descending and asked the flight attendants if we were descending because of the burning smell. i advised the fas to grab their emergency gear at the ready in case the situation got worse.we advised atc of the situation which triggered a plethora of atc scripted questions to us which workload permitting i answered. e.g. the nature of the smoke? where the smoke was? were we wearing our oxygen masks? souls on board? fuel remaining?. our priority at this point was to get the aircraft on the ground safely but as quickly as possible. on the descent i was very busy as pilot monitoring. first we had our air masks on the whole time which was cumbersome. second handling numerous comms with atc talking to the fas discussing the divert with the captain and loading a divert into the fms for zzz. the captain was handling the emergency descent which took most of his attention. center offered us any runway at zzz i asked which way they were landing they said west so i requested xxl. the captain was so busy with the descent that he did not change his instrument approach plates from theoriginal destination to zzz nor did he have time to so i asked for him to hand me his ipad and i loaded the appropriate plates for the divert to zzz.approach checklist was handled through 18000 feet as is standard. flight attendants advised they were doing okay in the cabin. we discussed how to brief the passengers fas asked if we were going to say something to the passengers. but because we were wearing our air masks i asked the fas to give the briefing as i did not want to raise more panic by them hearing me sound like darth vader on the overhead speaker with my air mask on. the captain advised them to say we were going to zzz out of a safety precaution. while getting ready for landing i did not have time to get atis were too busy so i asked atc for the weather to enter into the fms for performance. the weather was good it would be a night visual. we did not have time to acars dispatch of the divert that would have been too much of a time sink and a distraction. i thought about it but did not see having any time to do it nor did i think about asking atc to contact company was just too busy.when we got lined up for a long final approach we were still too high so atc vectored us out towards the east. they asked me when we wanted to turn back to the field. i advised them that it was too dark in the direction we were flying that we could not see the airport we were descending at 3000 fpm and if they would help us by calling our turn back to the final approach course. i was also getting task saturated.atc turned us a couple more times then switched us to approach control. at this point they advised us that rwy xxl was closed i wish center would have told us since we requested xxl with them that would have saved me time close in to the field. so i was busy again loading the fms for xxr. when handed off to tower we advised that we anticipated a normal landing and that we planned to taxi off the runway. landing checklist was completed. fire and rescue was all lined up adjacent to the field. landing was uneventful.upon landing we taxied off. at this point there began to be confusion. first we called ops and they said they didnt have a gate for us second ground control advised that the fire department was on a different frequency and wanted to talk about how to scan the plane for hot spots third we had a bunch of cautionfault lights just come on after we taxied off the runway regarding faults with the avionics blower and extract fan requiring an ecam procedure to override and then the fault warnings repeated even after we pressed the overrides. while talking with the fire department they advised we needed to pull to a gate to scan the plane. at that moment the fas in the back called us and advised that they now for the first time were smelling smoke. we told them to update us if it got worse and that we were sorting out getting a gate.we quickly advised ops that we needed a gate immediately or we were going to request any gate at the airport. and if we didnt get any gate and if the smoke smell escalated then the next consideration was to potentially have the air slides deploy to get the passengers off the plane. ops responded to go to gate z. upon getting to the gate the ground crew scrambled to get us in after parking we opened up our emergency windows in the flight deck to get fresh air in the plane.fire department came on the plane first in full gear while the passengers remained seated followed by maintenance in the flight deck where they reviewed the fault lights we had for the avionics. the captain got real busy with dispatch maintenance and observing the deplaning process.while we were super busy in the flight deck a company gate lead popped in and interrupted us in front of maintenance to tell us that crew scheduling had us taking another airbus that was a ron routine overnight to take the passengers on to the original destination. the captain politely told the gate lead that we did not know that and we werent sure we were going to do that and that we had to talk to several people before we consider that.the captain called the chief pilot and apparently the chief pilot said that we could take the passengers on to the original destination but he had our back either way if we decided not to. at this point that would have been an fdp flight duty period extension. i told the captain that i was shocked that the chief pilot would even suggest such a thing us flying another leg and take an extension after we had just had an emergency performed an emergency descent a divert to zzz and had our air masks on for over 30 minutes. i found it to be incredibly insensitive and inappropriate. the inconvenience to the passengers should be handled by another flight crew it appeared to me that managements view of safety was getting blurred with operational needs to accommodate the stranded passengers.after the flight had deplaned the captain walked up the jetway to greet passengers to see if everyone was okay. there were no health problems. meanwhile the flight attendants and i discussed that we did not want to do another leg. one flight attendant in particular had already told the gate lead that he did not want to work another leg.while in the jetway discussing the situation with the flight crew the gate lead came down to talk to us but she was still on the phone talking to someone in dispatchops and telling them that she wasnt sure if the crew was going to continue to the original destination because one of the flight attendants was having issues. the flight attendant told the gate lead that it was very insensitive of her to be calling him out in front of everybody as the problem for not continuing the flight to the original destination. the gate lead did not get what the fa was saying rather she started to bark at all of us that all her managers had gone for the day they had no real help from the company to accommodate the stranded passengers and that it was going to be a real inconvenience for them if we didnt continue on with another flight.the gate lead left for a moment and the crew discussed how we felt about flying another leg. all three fas said they were tired and could do the flight only because it was short. the captain said he was fine to continue to the original destination but if others didnt want to go he would support that decision. one flight attendant said because it was a short flight he could do it but really didnt want to because earlier this year he had a fume event and got sick from it and had to get medical attention. the captain said whatever you guys want to do ill support your decision. the gate lead came back again she looked stressed and then got really pushy and was saying i dont know whats the holdup are you going to do the flight? at this point i said that the gate lead was too overbearing that she was smothering us and becoming the problem pushing us after we had just handled an emergency and we still needed time to decompress. the gate lead would not leave and i told her that we were not going to make a decision until she gave us some space.after the gate lead left i reflected on the day three legs and not wanting to do an fdp extension for a 4th leg after an emergency. while i knew i could go to the original destination i was now irritated by the gate lead singling out the fa that didnt want to go and then being way too pushy to us to work the next flight. so i told the captain theres no way im doing another leg and we need hotel rooms in zzz. the captain told the gate lead.while waiting for crew scheduling to figure out hotels the gate lead approached me and said she was sorry that she realized we have a very busy night and she was wrong to push us.company pushes crews after an emergency to work extra flight.\n",

            "Narrative: we were cruising at fl390 about 75 minutes into the flight when we received a fourchime call from the cabin. we were informed that there was smoke in the cabin from an unknown source. per nonnormal guidance we donned our oxygen masks and established communication. i was pilot flying so i maintained aircraft control as the captain notified atc of our situation and requested a landing at the nearest suitable airport. center pointed out a possible alternate at 1 oclock and 60 miles. we were immediately cleared to 8000 and began an emergency descent. the captain was forced to shed his headset because the oxygen mask would not fit over it. as a result he used the cockpit speaker to listen and kept hot mic on.the sounds of breathing made it very difficult to understand what was being said. we deployed the speedbrakes and extended the landing gear on speed in order to increase our descent rate and expedite a landing at the alternate. i took over the radios while the captain coordinated with the cabin crew. this allowed me to listen to and understand what atc was saying. next the captain ran the smoke fire or fumes nonnormal checklist. while descending through fl270 we received a call from the cabin that a usb battery device was found to be the source of the smoke. it had been placed in the containment bag and was no longer smoking. they also indicated that the smoke was clearing out from the cabin. we elected to level off near fl250 and await confirmation that the situation was safe. with this confirmation received we removed our oxygen masks and reviewed the remainder of the procedure per qrh guidance. we elected to cancel the divert climb and continue to destination. the captain gave a pa explaining the situation and that we were continuing to the destination. a noncompany fa flight attendant was onboard and assisting our flight attendants with the situation. being a fluent spanish speaker she also repeated all of the captains pas in spanish which was extremely helpful in keeping the customers calm. we asked that ground personnel meet us at the gate to inspect the containment bag. additionally ems was requested because one of our fas had received an injury to her hand while securing the device. a normal landing ensued and our aircraft was escorted to the gate by ground personnel. with the device in the aft galley area still secure in the containment bag we decided to deplane the customers. once this was accomplished the fire crew tended to the containment bag while ems attended the injured fa who was treated briefly. we were given the all clear by the fire crew and the event was concluded. this situation was successfully handled because of the professionalism and teamwork demonstrated by our crew. our flight attendants including the other airline fa reacted quickly and assertively. because of their actions this flight had a successful outcome. our situation was clearly mitigated by the containment bag. without it we would have diverted and emergency egressed at the alternate.difficulty that we encountered in the cockpit was an inability to communicate clearly with the oxygen masks on. the captains mask would not fit over his headset so it was quickly shed and communication was established by use of the speaker and hot mike. this technique works well in the simulator however in the airplane descending rapidly with the landing gear down there was too much background noise mixed with regulator sounds to allow easy communication. in hindsight a better technique would have been to not use the speaker but put the headphones on over the mask straps. additionally only using the yoke push to talk interphone switch when speaking would have also reduced the noise level in the cockpit and on the radios.\n",

            "Narrative: departing zzz for zzz1 at about 13700 feet we got a very loud sound like an air horn. it sounded as though it was on the first officers side. i would compare it to someone holding down an air horn like youd find at a sports event. we both agreed immediately there must be some kind of air leak or faulty seal. we immediately requested a descent to 10000. i told the first officer his aircraft his radios tell them we want to return to zzz. i called the cabin who said they heard it as well they thought it was an alarm going off and was loud enough it could be heard significantly far back in the cabin. i explained though loud and unsettling it was minor we already where reaching an altitude where pressurization was no longer needed and due to the issue we would return to zzz for a precautionary landing id call them back once we caught up. i made a calm similar pa to the passengers. i heard the first officer at this time change frequency and the controller asked if we were requesting priority handling i told the first officer that sounds good. i considered how it was difficult to communicate and that we would be over weight when landing and could not logically think of any reason not to. i then called zzz ops and maintenance and spoke to maintenance they asked if we could go to zzz2 i said no it wasnt suitable and said i was ok with zzz3 or zzz. the noise made communication difficult thus i elected calling on the radio vs crew phone. i also sent an acars message and acars diversion report. the first officer got us on a delay vector and down to 7000. zzz maintenance called maintenance control and operations control i believe and told us zzz was ok but if i do get time call operations control to verify the best airport operationally. at this time we leveled at 7000 and the noise finally stopped. i told zzz that id call operations control. i called dispatch on the crew phone they also requested zzz2 i told them unable in which the dispatcher asked if i would go to zzz3. i said zzz3 was good it has a longer runway than zzz anyway and confirmed the company would prefer i go to zzz3 vs zzz he confirmed and acar us the new information. we informed atc we requested the longest suitable runway which was xxl and was in use. we requested to have fire rescue meet us upon landing. we continued the delay vectors a few more times as we ran the non routine landing check list and overweight landing check list. followed by setting up and briefing the approach. we then ran the descent and before landing check list. during this i briefed the flight attendants again about the precautionary landing and made a calm reassuring brief pa to the passengers. i then took back the aircraft from the first officer. we did the rnav xxl and we landed uneventfully on xxl exited followed the correct flow passengers inspection and proceeded uneventfully to the gate in which maintenance met the aircraft.i believe our training worked very well and it felt like a good sim session. we communicated well in the flight deck even with the barriers of a very loud noise. first officer was very quick to identify we should descend right away to 10000. we ran the threat and error management model and both briefed each other well and checked in that we were performing normally. first officer was an absolute asset and monumental in a safe calm correct outcome.\n",

            "Narrative: in cruise flight at flight level 340 received ecam for hydraulic yellow reservoir low level. completed the ecam procedures checked for follow up in qrh contacted dispatchmaintenance to discuss best course of action. i decided that a divert to zzz was required. aircraft would have only single reverser 40 of ground spoilers would not work and nose wheel steering would be inoperative after landing. i chose zzz because it has long runways and i knew my landing distance would be affected by the failures. the diversion was made the landing was completed. airport rescue and firefighting arff was on scene and looked over the aircraft. we were then hooked to a super tug to be towed to the gate. while crossing the boundary from ground control to ramp control the escort vehicle leading the tug stopped at the ramp entrance and the tug carrying the aircraft was unable to stop and hit the escort vehicle. no damage was noted by me and i believe the collision speed was less than 1 mph. upon arrival at the gate the aircraft maintenance logbook aml was filled out for the yellow hydraulic failure and the collision with the ground vehicle. approximately one minute after i received an ecam for the low hydraulic level the flight attendant called me to notify me that we had a passenger that was having an anxiety attack. there was weather in the zzz1 area and we had light to moderate turbulence for approximately 40 minutes during the climbout. this was also my first officers first trip off oe as a new hire pilot. several causal factors played a role in the event. 1 widespread convective activity in the zzz1 area gave us a pretty rough ride which was concerning enough for at least one passenger to become distressed. this did not have any relevance to the rest of the event except that it was distracting to deal with during the course of the event. 2 new hire fo. this trip was the first officers first trip off oe at airline x. the event occurred on the third leg of the trip. he is an experienced pilot from airline y and did a fantastic job. 3 dispatchmaintenance. in making my decision to divert to zzz i contacted dispatch and maintenance control to confer about the issues. dispatch told me that operationally they wouldve preferred the aircraft to be in zzz2. i decided to divert to zzz because i could not justify flying for another two hours and then request priority handling because of the landing distance issues. 4 after landing process. i had let dispatch and maintenance know the nature of the problem and that we would need to be towed off of the runway to the gate. after arff looked over the aircraft maintenance showed up in a pick up truck with gear pins and were told that they just needed to pin the gear and i would taxi to the gate. i informed them that i had no nose wheel steering and i would have to be towed with a tug. the whole event from landing to getting a tug to removal from the runway took approximately 20 to 30 minutes because the tug was not waiting for us when we landed. this tied up the runway in zzz while they were doing instrument approaches. to me it just seemed like there wasnt adequate coordination done before we got there.i dont believe that there is anything that couldve been done to resolve the hydraulic issue but i do have some observations about things that may be wouldve been helpful. 1 ive been involved with two priority handling requests in the last six months and it doesnt seem to me that dispatch is much of a resource. i generally have the expectation that im calling them to help me with my issue but i think that ive learned that i need to have a course of action decided and just tell them what im going to do. 2 when we arrived at the gate there was a slew of people in the jetway to meet us the arff event commander inflight coordinator etc. i never got a chance to talk to the tug driver because he had unplugged and driven off and was gone to his next assignment before i got a chance to thank him or discuss the event. the collision was not his fault and i wanted to let him know that but to also let him know that it had to go in the aml. 3 the flight attendants were gone before i ever got a chance to thank them or debrief them. they elected not to continue with their trip and went home i think in the future i will make sure that i get the opportunity to debrief everybody but i was so busy talking to arff mechanics etc. that i never got the chance. 4 i have decided that in the future if i have to request priority handling once we land the trip will be over for me. i agreed to swap aircraft and fly the remainder of the flight and passengers to zzz2 because crew scheduling told us that once we got to zzz2 we would be done and could go to the hotel for the night. enroute they reassigned us to an additional leg after we got to zzz2. i was to deadhead on the flight to zzz and my first officer was to fly it. this makes for a very exhausting day when the first leg was a priority handling event and erodes the safety margin. the first officer told me that at airline y it is policy that if you request priority handling you are done and are removed from the rest of the trip. being a new hire on his first trip with airline x he didnt have the choice not to do the leg. i will not allow that to happen again.\n",

            "Narrative: the preparation and departure for etops flight from zzz to zzz1 airports was routine.   all was still normal as we climbed through 10000 feet and i checkedannounced the pressurization panel cabin altitude indicated near sea level.   we received a clearance to climb to a final cruising altitude from zzz approach of fl340 changed from original fl350  changed the fmc and pressure controller altitude to reflect 340  we didnt notice anything out of the ordinary.  we were cleared direct zzzzz.   we reached flight level 340 and were there approximately 8 minutes.  zzz approach cleared us to switch to enroute frequencies. soon after fo first officer  scanned the overhead and acutely recognized  announced that the differential pressure was displaying approx 6.5 which is less than we typically see.   with that awareness i noticed and pointed out that our cabin altitude pressure was very close to 10000 and moments later the cabin altitude warning horn began to sound. fo and i immediately proceeded with our immediate action items o2 on 100 crew comm. established seat belt sign on. i pulled out the qrc for the cabin altitude warning and began the checklist. since we had just left zzz freq. and we had not yet left the fir i switched back to zzz approach and asked for a turn back to zzz2 airport. i requested priority handling and proceeded with the checklist and descent. the outflow valve appeared fully closed before confirmed with checklist. pass oxygen switch was selected on and the masks were dropped in the back. in the course of the descent i believe the cabin altitude got to 12k but didnt see anything beyond that.   i spoke with the flight attendants and the passengers.   when we reached 10k and were in hold to burn fuel to reach max landing weight we put controller back to auto and it seemed to control cabin fine at the lower altitude.    we proceeded with vectors to an rnav approach and uneventful landing to runway xxr at zzz2.   during the process we communicated several times with the flight attendants they were very calm and professional throughout and that was reflected by the passengers cooperative and calm nature as well.   fo was equally professional with his focus in continuing to prioritize flying the aircraft first in a very skilled manner.   his recognition of the pressure differential abnormality certainly helped lessen the startle effect that could have made the situation more difficult.     there were no other faults associated with the event no failure of the pressure controller or pack faults.     the cabin altitude warning horn and the cabin altitudedifferential pressure gauge were our only indications of faults with the system.   initial speed in the hold at zzzzz1 was inadvertently 250 kts but corrected in the first turn.  one concern and difficulty was communicating with audio panel that used a rubberband to hold switch in the intercom position.   the rubber band appeared on but was not holding in the select position.\n",

            "Narrative: during takeoff from zzzz runway xxr in low speed regime had a flicker of an eicas caution message r hyd qty.the message disappeared instantly. continued takeoff roll and through approximately 125130 knots with a v1 speed of 166 knots the same eicas caution message reappeared and remained and i made the decision to reject the takeoff. immediate action items were followed and tower was notified of rejection. i made the decision to roll to the end of the runway in hopes the brakes would be less likely to overheat considering in part aircraft weight speed and runway length. we cleared runway at end and i stopped aircraft on parallel taxiway to complete checklists and assess brake conditions. the fire personnel had been notified and were proceeding to aircraft as we stopped on taxiway. i believe tower personnel had made that notification to the fire personnel. we were in contact with fire rescue personnel commander on vhf 2. the brake temperatures eventually began to rise and the firerescue lead could see some smoke and at some point said possibly a flame they sprayed water on wheel truck. this produced immediate results and temperatures were lowered and no further visible smoke or fire evidence. i did not feel evacuation was necessary and the firerescue lead agreed with that judgment as well as copilots. at some point firerescue advised the number 2 tire had deflated as a protection. maintenance control and zzzz operations were all utilized. with the brake temperatures now at normal readings and in coordination with fire rescue and operations the passengers were briefed on deplaning with airstairs onto buses and brought to terminal. eventually the entire crew left the plane onto a bus. operationsmaintenance lead confirmed the aircraft would be towed for inspections.\n",

was the pilot flying pf captain was pilot monitoring pm there was no jumpseater or other flight deck crew members present. the predeparture briefing included duties in case of abnormal operations or emergency  pf would continue to fly the aircraft and take the radios pm would run any required checklists. goaround procedures were briefed during the descent briefing. the approach was planned as a normal zzz ils xxr in visual gustywind conditions.at approximately xa00 on day 0 the flight was approaching zzzzz  zzz ils xxr final approach fix  at approximately 1800 ft. agl. as briefed the fo called for gear extension and setting flaps 15. the gear extension sounded normal at first. however both pilots observed abnormal landing gear position light indications. the following indications were noted all three green landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. all three green landing gear indicator lights on the aft overhead panel were illuminated. all three red landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. a single unfamiliar tone  beep  sounded briefly.unsure of what may have caused the abnormal landing gear position indications and the unfamiliar tone  neither the pm nor the pf had heard this tone before  the pm suggested a goaround from the current altitude and the pf called for the goaround and started the procedures as briefed. atc stated aircraft x go around runway heading climb and maintain 3000 ft. the first half  i.e. toga engagement raising flaps to 15 which we were already positioned at checking thrust raising gear and setting missed approach altitude  of the goaround was conducted normally. at this time atc started calling to ask about the reason for the goaround. this interrupted the goaround procedure. approximately 30 seconds later as the aircraft was accelerating the remaining procedures were accomplished  heading select level change setting clean maneuvering speed raising flaps to 0 aftertakeoff checklist. allowing the atc interruption and subsequent delay was pilotcrew error. however the procedures were accomplished fully and safely.after goaround procedures were accomplished and the aircraft was overflying the zzz field during the field overflight the tower reported that the aircrafts left main gear appeared to be extended while all other gear appeared retracted. all landing gear indicators on the flight deck appeared normal i.e. there were no red or green gear lights illuminated. the crew had no way to confirm whether or not the left main gear was extended. atc queried the crew as to what airspace was required to resolve the issue. the pm requested vectors to remain in the local area and atc vectored the flight west and directed a climb to 5000 ft. msl. the pf engaged the autopilot and maintained 230 kias via the mcp mode control panel speed window.during the vector the pf selected vnav instead of continuing the lvl chg climb. this caused the aircraft to start a brief descent while it attempted to recapture the cruise altitude in the fmc. the issue was identified by the pf who disconnected the autopilot and set the desired pitch attitude for the climb followed by requesting reengagement of lvl chg which was accomplished by the pm. the pf then reengaged the autopilot.the pm started to run ng gear disagree checklist. the pf coordinated vectors with atc and confirmed altitude and heading changes with the pm. while running the checklist the pm step 1  landing gear lever is off. step 2  landing gear lever moved to the up position after takeoff goaround. step 3  235 kias maximum landing gear lever up. step 4  all red and green landing gear indicator lights are extinguished. end of the checklist.pmthen determined that no additional resolution was available. we as a crew discussed if we should request priority handling but it was decided that we had time and fuel 14400 lb. left to continue to work on the problem. so we opted not to request priority handling at that time. however atc then asked us souls on board and fuel remaining so we provided them with the information of sob and 14400 lb. of fuel remaining or 144 minutes of flight time available. they essentially provided priority handling for us. since we had no indication if our left main gear was still extended or not like the zzz tower had told us it was the crew then decided to contact a company ground agency for any potential assistance or information they could provide. the pm contacted company zzz operations who then directed us to contact company zzz maintenance. the maintenance personnel suggested cycling the manual gear extension door located behind the fo on the floor open and closed as well as check for any popped circuit breakers. no additional resolution was gained as all landing gear indicator lights were still extinguished. while the pm was communicating with maintenance atc contacted the pf and suggested the flight overfly zzz1 airport where tower personnel could examine the gear positions with binoculars. the pf agreed and accepted vectors toward zzz1. when the pm was available the pf briefed the pm on the plan to have zzz1 personnel visually inspect the gear. the pm agreed then briefed the purser and made a short announcement to the passengers.once the pm confirmed checklist usage complete maintenance agreed with the plan to overfly zzz1 and extend the gear. the pf accepted a descent to 2000 ft. msl and continued toward zzz1. approaching zzz1 the pf extended the gear with pm concurrence. the aircraft was at 230 kias. the gear extension appeared normal both in sound and landing gear light indicator illumination sequence. when complete there were three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the instrument panel three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the aft overhead panel and zero red landing gear indicator lights illuminated. the aircraft overflew zzz1 at 2000 ft. msl and in a right turn toward the south. through zzz approach control zzz1 tower personnel reported that all three landing gear appeared to be down. at this time ground  maintenance communications were called complete.with normal gear indications on the flight deck and visual confirmation from zzz1 tower the pf and pm decided that the gear would remain down for the remainder of the flight. at this point the crew discussed and determined the following all applicable checklists were run. both flight crew members were comfortable moving into the approach  landing phase. the pf would continue to fly the aircraft. call to purser to rebrief the flight attendants on the situation and to not plan for an evacuation.the pf then requested and accepted vectors for the zzz ils xxr. the pm reloaded the approach into the fmc and the pf called for the descent checklist. the localizer was intercepted between zzzzz1 and zzzzz. the remainder of the flight including approach landing and taxiin were uneventful. during the approach it was apparent that atc most likely tower personnel provided us priority handling and made airport rescue and firefighting arff vehicles available. additionally on short final zzz tower personnel confirmed that all three gear appeared to be down. arff vehicles and equipment followed us to the gate area.after parking shutting down the aircraft and conducting a short crewonly debrief  which focused on the goaround procedures and checklist usage  the flight crew was met by two zzz assistant chief pilots person a and person b and one company maintenance representative. the flight crew was fully debriefed by maintenance and other personnel. the pf entered an electronic logbook entry to document theevent.\n",

            "Narrative: after starting the 2 engine the pushback crew noticed a large amount smoke behind the engine which quickly went away.  because there was very little wind. some of this smoke entered the aircraft before we finished starting the 1 engine. other than a slightly odd smell it seemed to disperse quickly.  i verbalized this to the pushback crew and the first officer. additionally i mentioned to the fo first officer that i would call the flight attendants and make an announcement over the pa. before taxiing the fas flight attendants called to report the smell and that there was some possibility of smoke or haze in the cabin. i communicated through the fo that we would check back with them after we taxied a ways to see if it was improving or getting worse. i also made a pa to the passengers.  at this time i believed the problem was that we had ingested exhaust fumes from the engine start. after taxiing for about four minutes i checked back with the fas and the front two could neither see nor smell anything. the back two said they could still smell something but not see anything.  they also stated that it was not getting better but neither was it getting worse. i discussed the situation with the fo and he felt there was no reason not to go but thought one more check with the fas might help.  since we just talked to them and they were alright with going i elected to continue. we executed a normal takeoff and upon approaching the cleanup altitude the odd smell returned and i stated that this was something that required us to return to zzz. simultaneously the fas also reported the smoke and fumes had returned. i am not sure of the precise order of events but we donned our oxygen masks notified atc and requested a return to the airport.with our masks on the fo and i struggled to communicate with each other and atc. basically the design shoots so much oxygen into the mask that it overpowers the microphone inside it.  we both operated the mask correctly and spent some effort and time verifying the settings but nothing worked. for this reason i elected to make a relatively quick return to the airfield. in all my experience 43 years i have never had a problem like this with a mask.  i asked maintenance control if i should write both masks up and said no because they frequently get complaints like this. we flew a box pattern and made an uneventful landing with cfr crash fire rescue truck giving us a good check out.  after coordinating with the company and flight attendants and briefing the passengers we taxied to the gate. during the taxi we did not experience anymore smoke and fumes. maintenance technicians checked the aircraft out informed us that the b system hydraulic system was over serviced and had entered in the ventilation system where it produced the smoke and fumes. continued flying would not have improved our situation so i was glad we made a prompt return. i think the decision to take the aircraft flying was not good in retrospect but all of us thought there was no reason at the time to not go flying.  i have had similar situations just like this and the problem went away once there was sufficient air moving through the cabin. looking back even though there was contradictory inputs from the fas there was still enough to warrant a return to gate. the problems with o2 masks is unacceptable.  maybe they would have worked better at higher altitudes we only climbed to 6000 ft but it made the flight deck workload very high and challenging.\n",

            "Narrative: during cruise the flight attendants in the aft galley called to let me know that all five of the aft galley circuit breakers had popped. they asked if they should reset them and i told them definitely not to. we checked the cockpit circuit breakers which were all normal. i sent an acars message to dispatch to let them know about the circuit breakers and asked them to pass it along to maintenance control. just prior to descent we smelled a strong sulfury odor in the cockpit that dissipated after about a minute. we had the same odor a few minutes later. at this point we thought that it was someone in the lavatory. the flight attendants called us to let us know that they also smelled it but that there was no one in the lavatory. the smell was gone again shortly so i told them to keep us informed. by the third time that we had the smell i asked them to see if someone could have a colostomy bag or if there was an obvious source that could be the cause. they said that the passengers in the front rows of the airplane all thought that someone had bad gas. they checked and said that there was no bag. i asked but at this point it did not smell like any type of a fire to them. i asked them to try to isolate the location of the smell and to check for smoke. at this point we were about twenty minutes from landing. at about 12000 feet on the arrival the flight attendants called to tell me that the odor was strongest at about row 10 there was no obvious smoke and the passengers in the forward cabin all had their noses covered. they said that they now smelled an electrical burning smell at row 10. i asked if they all agreed with this and they all did believe it was electrical. i had transferred control of the airplane to the first officer to fly the arrival and approach as we were now descending through about 8000 feet. we let approach control know that we were requesting priority and would like to have emergency personnel standing by at the runway to check for any obvious smoke. we were immediately cleared for the approach and cleared to land. i ran the smoke fire or fumes checklist as we configured for the approach. after we finished the checklist i quickly informed the flight attendants of what would happen once we landed. we landed and cleared the runway to hold on the intersection. i informed the passengers that we were going to have a fire truck inspect the aircraft due to the odor on the airplane out of an abundance of caution. fire personnel did an inspection of the aircraft and saw no smoke or hot spots on the aircraft. at this point we had no odors in the aircraft and had not since we had run the qrh checklist. we asked them to follow us to the gate so that we could deplane the passengers and have them inspect the interior of the aircraft. i made another pa to the passengers to let them know that everything was fine and safe and that they would see the fire trucks as they followed us to the gate.at the gate i quickly spoke with dispatch to let her know what was going on and that i would call back once we had deplaned and inspected the airplane. we deplaned the passengers as i spoke with the fire personnel in the jetway and they said that they still saw no hot spots on the aircraft but would inspect the cabin. at this point our a flight attendant let me know that both of the forward galley circuit breakers had popped at some point and that all of the water had drained out of the potable water tank. the passengers all seemed happy and no one seemed concerned. we saw no evidence of a fire in the airplane and there was no remaining odor. i spoke with my crew to make sure that they were okay to continue on our next flight and then had a conference call with dispatch and a chief pilot. i also spoke with maintenance control to explain what had happened. the aircraft was taken out of service and i made a logbook entry and stayed with maintenance until he let me know that company was sending mechanics.\n",

            "Narrative: i was the captain. preflight preparation pushback startup and taxi out were uneventful. we took off on runway xx with a flaps 5 setting. climb out to fl340 was also uneventful. approximately 40 minutes after takeoff we got a c hyd qty eicas message. we pulled up the status page and noticed that the center hydraulic quantity was at .43 and decreasing rapidly. the first officer pulled out the qrh and ipad and referenced the procedures for this anomaly. the center pumps both electric and the demand pumps were secured. this slowed the quantity decrease but did not stop it. i initiated a satcom call to dispatch and was eventually conferenced in with maintenance the operations and the 756 fleet guys. a detailed discussion ensued covering all implications of continuing the flight or turning around and returning to zzzz or another suitable divert aerodrome. the divert option was eventually ruled out as it would involve fuel dumping 13000 available to dump and at least two hours of loitering to burn down to max landing weight for the 767300. my concerns about the legality of continuing an etops flight without the center system and associated loss of our hmg hydraulic motor generator were assuaged and we collectively internal flight crew and external resources decided to continue the crossing. the flight proceeded normally until approaching zzz. i was on third break and returned to the cockpit approximately 50 minutes before scheduled landing. the center system quantity at this point was .11. the three of us discussed all possible scenarios again and we began our descent. when we checked in with approach we advised atc and requested the ils to xxr so as not to interrupt normal operations on the center and left runways. this also gave us potential maneuvering airspace on the less congested side of the airport.at 6000 ft. and about 35 miles from the approach end of xxr we ran the checklist items. we were reasonably certain that the center system would not work due to the spoiler eicas when i deployed speed brakes on the descent. when the demand pump was turned on the center pressure lights remained on so we continued the applicable checklist. we had slowed to 220 knots clean maneuvering and began to bring the flaps down via the alternate method. as the flaps transited from 0 to 1 we got a le slats asymmetry eicas and the flaps stopped moving. we were now around 22 miles from the runway and still at 220 knots. we informed tower that we might have to execute a 360 degree turn to work the additional emergency of split slats. we had also lost the left yaw damper earlier in the flight. the relief pilot was working the le slats problem while we continued the alternate flap problem. i called for the alternate gear extension at some point in this process and the gear came down and locked as advertised. i asked the pm pilot monitoring to select flaps 5 on the alternate switch and around 12 miles from touchdown the flaps began to move again but still with the asymmetry indication. i asked the relief pilot if that was going to be a problem and he said not if the flaps come down. we continued to dial the speed back as the flaps came down and after almost 6 minutes from alternate flap initiation and at approximately 810 miles we got the aircraft at flaps 20 and target speed 150 ref 144  6 knots for the wind 12012.i disengaged the auto flight at 1500 ft. and flew a normal approach to touch down on xxr. we exited the runway and with the reserve steering and brakes switch engaged had enough standpipe pressure to clear the runway using nose wheel steering. emergency responders were there immediately and confirmed that we still had hydraulic fluid leaking from the port wheel well area and we soon had zero center quantity as the remaining fluid leaked out. a tug eventually came and towed us to our gate. i would like to say that this was a textbook collaboration of resources both internal cockpit and cabin and external. we worked as a team and resolved what could have been a serious emergency. i kept the pursuer engaged from soon after the caution light until after landing. i did not ask that the cabin be prepared for evacuation due to the nature of the problem and only an extra 810 knot approach speed expected. although i didnt use the term cabin advisory the words i used when briefing her were reflective of that process. tip of the hat to all involved and 220 souls on board were happy to have landed safely.\n",

            "Narrative: normal take off from runway xxr at zzz with first officer flying. fairly heavy b737ng at 174000 lbs 35000 lbs of fuel bound for zzz1. at approximately 2000 msl i began to detect a burning or melting plastic odor smelling identical to what a piece of tupperware that had fallen onto the heating element in a dishwasher and melted would smell like. i asked the first officer if he smelled it and he replied yes. we were still sterile cockpit but the flight attendants called from the back and were very concerned with the same odor that was filling the cabin. i told them to search the cabin to see if the source of the odor could be isolated lavatories ovens coffee maker etc. and call back. we had leveled at 5000 feet and when zzz departure issued us another climb i declined the climb and told atc we had an issue and would get back with them. at this point the first officers audio control panel went haywire with extremely loud static being broadcast into his headset and speaker regardless of what radio was selected and he was unable to transmit. the purser called back and said that the source of the odor could not be determined but it was strong and she now smelled what she described as burning paper. this aircraft had just returned to service after a change of the 2 engine and this was the first flight after the change. the engine in terms of performance was operating normally but the possibility of it being involved in creating this situation did give me further concern. with the combination of the unidentifiable odor and failure of communication equipment i made the decision to advise atc and return back to zzz.once advised atc was very efficient in getting us back around for a landing on one of the long western facing runways and things happened rapidly. we were landing overweight and i wanted a long runway for braking and winds which were quite gusty with a crosswind component. the first officer remained as the flying pilot and executed a normal approach and landing to runway xxr. upon exiting the runway we had fire and emergency personnel inspect the aircraft for a potential fire source. no abnormal heat source could be detected and we returned to the gate without further incident.\n",

            "Narrative: about halfway through cruise at 38000 feet the captain and i noticed some very subtle but different feeling vibration in the flight deck. we reviewed the n1n2 vibration indicators and they were well within the normal range. i suggested to the captain that the vibration may be happening from something other than the engines. the captain suggested that we review the vibration advisory in the qrh. we reviewed the qrh regarding engine vibration and noted what to do in the event we had excessive engine vibration. the procedure was not needed under these specific conditions.the vibration was intermittent and hard to concretely sense it was really any concern. however we did for our own interest review nearest airport options in case the vibration became significant.the vibration ended and we didnt discuss more about it. then about 1015 minutes later i smelled a burning smell towards the rudder pedals. it had the smell of something similar to when you light a match. i also felt some heat from the fumes. i advised the captain that i believed we had smoke in the flight deck and we immediately donned our air masks. we then called the fas flight attendants and they reported that they did not smell any smoke. we advised the fas that we were keeping our masks on for now because we smelled smoke.  the captain and i were slightly surprised that the fas did not smell anything because we were still smelling smoke. so to troubleshoot we decided to look at all of our peds personal devices to see if anything was burning. peds were fine. while keeping the masks on we did each take them off briefly to confirm we still had a burning smell which we did.there were no indications from any of our instrumentation and advisory system screens that anything out of the ordinary was going on. but i had no confidence that the burning smell was going to end. rather i was concerned that that situation was going to escalate from a burning smell to a fire. i shared my concerns with the captain and that i felt we needed to divert to zzz we were about 1015 minutes from top of descent to original destination if the smell persisted for 2 more minutes and he agreed. the smell persisted we advised center that we needed to divert to zzz. they gave us vectors direct and to descend to 16000 ft. we then advised the flight attendants we were diverting to zzz because we kept smelling a burning smell in the flight deck.shortly after we started our descent the fas advised us that they also had a noticeable burning smell from the exit row up to the flight deck. upon receiving this information the captain and i concurred that we should advise atc for priority into zzz and to have firerescue at the field. later we would also learn that there was a first officer in row 17 who also noticed a burning smell while were descending and asked the flight attendants if we were descending because of the burning smell. i advised the fas to grab their emergency gear at the ready in case the situation got worse.we advised atc of the situation which triggered a plethora of atc scripted questions to us which workload permitting i answered. e.g. the nature of the smoke? where the smoke was? were we wearing our oxygen masks? souls on board? fuel remaining?. our priority at this point was to get the aircraft on the ground safely but as quickly as possible. on the descent i was very busy as pilot monitoring. first we had our air masks on the whole time which was cumbersome. second handling numerous comms with atc talking to the fas discussing the divert with the captain and loading a divert into the fms for zzz. the captain was handling the emergency descent which took most of his attention. center offered us any runway at zzz i asked which way they were landing they said west so i requested xxl. the captain was so busy with the descent that he did not change his instrument approach plates from theoriginal destination to zzz nor did he have time to so i asked for him to hand me his ipad and i loaded the appropriate plates for the divert to zzz.approach checklist was handled through 18000 feet as is standard. flight attendants advised they were doing okay in the cabin. we discussed how to brief the passengers fas asked if we were going to say something to the passengers. but because we were wearing our air masks i asked the fas to give the briefing as i did not want to raise more panic by them hearing me sound like darth vader on the overhead speaker with my air mask on. the captain advised them to say we were going to zzz out of a safety precaution. while getting ready for landing i did not have time to get atis were too busy so i asked atc for the weather to enter into the fms for performance. the weather was good it would be a night visual. we did not have time to acars dispatch of the divert that would have been too much of a time sink and a distraction. i thought about it but did not see having any time to do it nor did i think about asking atc to contact company was just too busy.when we got lined up for a long final approach we were still too high so atc vectored us out towards the east. they asked me when we wanted to turn back to the field. i advised them that it was too dark in the direction we were flying that we could not see the airport we were descending at 3000 fpm and if they would help us by calling our turn back to the final approach course. i was also getting task saturated.atc turned us a couple more times then switched us to approach control. at this point they advised us that rwy xxl was closed i wish center would have told us since we requested xxl with them that would have saved me time close in to the field. so i was busy again loading the fms for xxr. when handed off to tower we advised that we anticipated a normal landing and that we planned to taxi off the runway. landing checklist was completed. fire and rescue was all lined up adjacent to the field. landing was uneventful.upon landing we taxied off. at this point there began to be confusion. first we called ops and they said they didnt have a gate for us second ground control advised that the fire department was on a different frequency and wanted to talk about how to scan the plane for hot spots third we had a bunch of cautionfault lights just come on after we taxied off the runway regarding faults with the avionics blower and extract fan requiring an ecam procedure to override and then the fault warnings repeated even after we pressed the overrides. while talking with the fire department they advised we needed to pull to a gate to scan the plane. at that moment the fas in the back called us and advised that they now for the first time were smelling smoke. we told them to update us if it got worse and that we were sorting out getting a gate.we quickly advised ops that we needed a gate immediately or we were going to request any gate at the airport. and if we didnt get any gate and if the smoke smell escalated then the next consideration was to potentially have the air slides deploy to get the passengers off the plane. ops responded to go to gate z. upon getting to the gate the ground crew scrambled to get us in after parking we opened up our emergency windows in the flight deck to get fresh air in the plane.fire department came on the plane first in full gear while the passengers remained seated followed by maintenance in the flight deck where they reviewed the fault lights we had for the avionics. the captain got real busy with dispatch maintenance and observing the deplaning process.while we were super busy in the flight deck a company gate lead popped in and interrupted us in front of maintenance to tell us that crew scheduling had us taking another airbus that was a ron routine overnight to take the passengers on to the original destination. the captain politely told the gate lead that we did not know that and we werent sure we were going to do that and that we had to talk to several people before we consider that.the captain called the chief pilot and apparently the chief pilot said that we could take the passengers on to the original destination but he had our back either way if we decided not to. at this point that would have been an fdp flight duty period extension. i told the captain that i was shocked that the chief pilot would even suggest such a thing us flying another leg and take an extension after we had just had an emergency performed an emergency descent a divert to zzz and had our air masks on for over 30 minutes. i found it to be incredibly insensitive and inappropriate. the inconvenience to the passengers should be handled by another flight crew it appeared to me that managements view of safety was getting blurred with operational needs to accommodate the stranded passengers.after the flight had deplaned the captain walked up the jetway to greet passengers to see if everyone was okay. there were no health problems. meanwhile the flight attendants and i discussed that we did not want to do another leg. one flight attendant in particular had already told the gate lead that he did not want to work another leg.while in the jetway discussing the situation with the flight crew the gate lead came down to talk to us but she was still on the phone talking to someone in dispatchops and telling them that she wasnt sure if the crew was going to continue to the original destination because one of the flight attendants was having issues. the flight attendant told the gate lead that it was very insensitive of her to be calling him out in front of everybody as the problem for not continuing the flight to the original destination. the gate lead did not get what the fa was saying rather she started to bark at all of us that all her managers had gone for the day they had no real help from the company to accommodate the stranded passengers and that it was going to be a real inconvenience for them if we didnt continue on with another flight.the gate lead left for a moment and the crew discussed how we felt about flying another leg. all three fas said they were tired and could do the flight only because it was short. the captain said he was fine to continue to the original destination but if others didnt want to go he would support that decision. one flight attendant said because it was a short flight he could do it but really didnt want to because earlier this year he had a fume event and got sick from it and had to get medical attention. the captain said whatever you guys want to do ill support your decision. the gate lead came back again she looked stressed and then got really pushy and was saying i dont know whats the holdup are you going to do the flight? at this point i said that the gate lead was too overbearing that she was smothering us and becoming the problem pushing us after we had just handled an emergency and we still needed time to decompress. the gate lead would not leave and i told her that we were not going to make a decision until she gave us some space.after the gate lead left i reflected on the day three legs and not wanting to do an fdp extension for a 4th leg after an emergency. while i knew i could go to the original destination i was now irritated by the gate lead singling out the fa that didnt want to go and then being way too pushy to us to work the next flight. so i told the captain theres no way im doing another leg and we need hotel rooms in zzz. the captain told the gate lead.while waiting for crew scheduling to figure

            "Narrative: we were cruising at fl390 about 75 minutes into the flight when we received a fourchime call from the cabin. we were informed that there was smoke in the cabin from an unknown source. per nonnormal guidance we donned our oxygen masks and established communication. i was pilot flying so i maintained aircraft control as the captain notified atc of our situation and requested a landing at the nearest suitable airport. center pointed out a possible alternate at 1 oclock and 60 miles. we were immediately cleared to 8000 and began an emergency descent. the captain was forced to shed his headset because the oxygen mask would not fit over it. as a result he used the cockpit speaker to listen and kept hot mic on.the sounds of breathing made it very difficult to understand what was being said. we deployed the speedbrakes and extended the landing gear on speed in order to increase our descent rate and expedite a landing at the alternate. i took over the radios while the captain coordinated with the cabin crew. this allowed me to listen to and understand what atc was saying. next the captain ran the smoke fire or fumes nonnormal checklist. while descending through fl270 we received a call from the cabin that a usb battery device was found to be the source of the smoke. it had been placed in the containment bag and was no longer smoking. they also indicated that the smoke was clearing out from the cabin. we elected to level off near fl250 and await confirmation that the situation was safe. with this confirmation received we removed our oxygen masks and reviewed the remainder of the procedure per qrh guidance. we elected to cancel the divert climb and continue to destination. the captain gave a pa explaining the situation and that we were continuing to the destination. a noncompany fa flight attendant was onboard and assisting our flight attendants with the situation. being a fluent spanish speaker she also repeated all of the captains pas in spanish which was extremely helpful in keeping the customers calm. we asked that ground personnel meet us at the gate to inspect the containment bag. additionally ems was requested because one of our fas had received an injury to her hand while securing the device. a normal landing ensued and our aircraft was escorted to the gate by ground personnel. with the device in the aft galley area still secure in the containment bag we decided to deplane the customers. once this was accomplished the fire crew tended to the containment bag while ems attended the injured fa who was treated briefly. we were given the all clear by the fire crew and the event was concluded. this situation was successfully handled because of the professionalism and teamwork demonstrated by our crew. our flight attendants including the other airline fa reacted quickly and assertively. because of their actions this flight had a successful outcome. our situation was clearly mitigated by the containment bag. without it we would have diverted and emergency egressed at the alternate.difficulty that we encountered in the cockpit was an inability to communicate clearly with the oxygen masks on. the captains mask would not fit over his headset so it was quickly shed and communication was established by use of the speaker and hot mike. this technique works well in the simulator however in the airplane descending rapidly with the landing gear down there was too much background noise mixed with regulator sounds to allow easy communication. in hindsight a better technique would have been to not use the speaker but put the headphones on over the mask straps. additionally only using the yoke push to talk interphone switch when speaking would have also reduced the noise level in the cockpit and on the radios.\n",

            "Narrative: in cruise flight at flight level 340 received ecam for hydraulic yellow reservoir low level. completed the ecam procedures checked for follow up in qrh contacted dispatchmaintenance to discuss best course of action. i decided that a divert to zzz was required. aircraft would have only single reverser 40 of ground spoilers would not work and nose wheel steering would be inoperative after landing. i chose zzz because it has long runways and i knew my landing distance would be affected by the failures. the diversion was made the landing was completed. airport rescue and firefighting arff was on scene and looked over the aircraft. we were then hooked to a super tug to be towed to the gate. while crossing the boundary from ground control to ramp control the escort vehicle leading the tug stopped at the ramp entrance and the tug carrying the aircraft was unable to stop and hit the escort vehicle. no damage was noted by me and i believe the collision speed was less than 1 mph. upon arrival at the gate the aircraft maintenance logbook aml was filled out for the yellow hydraulic failure and the collision with the ground vehicle. approximately one minute after i received an ecam for the low hydraulic level the flight attendant called me to notify me that we had a passenger that was having an anxiety attack. there was weather in the zzz1 area and we had light to moderate turbulence for approximately 40 minutes during the climbout. this was also my first officers first trip off oe as a new hire pilot. several causal factors played a role in the event. 1 widespread convective activity in the zzz1 area gave us a pretty rough ride which was concerning enough for at least one passenger to become distressed. this did not have any relevance to the rest of the event except that it was distracting to deal with during the course of the event. 2 new hire fo. this trip was the first officers first trip off oe at airline x. the event occurred on the third leg of the trip. he is an experienced pilot from airline y and did a fantastic job. 3 dispatchmaintenance. in making my decision to divert to zzz i contacted dispatch and maintenance control to confer about the issues. dispatch told me that operationally they wouldve preferred the aircraft to be in zzz2. i decided to divert to zzz because i could not justify flying for another two hours and then request priority handling because of the landing distance issues. 4 after landing process. i had let dispatch and maintenance know the nature of the problem and that we would need to be towed off of the runway to the gate. after arff looked over the aircraft maintenance showed up in a pick up truck with gear pins and were told that they just needed to pin the gear and i would taxi to the gate. i informed them that i had no nose wheel steering and i would have to be towed with a tug. the whole event from landing to getting a tug to removal from the runway took approximately 20 to 30 minutes because the tug was not waiting for us when we landed. this tied up the runway in zzz while they were doing instrument approaches. to me it just seemed like there wasnt adequate coordination done before we got there.i dont believe that there is anything that couldve been done to resolve the hydraulic issue but i do have some observations about things that may be wouldve been helpful. 1 ive been involved with two priority handling requests in the last six months and it doesnt seem to me that dispatch is much of a resource. i generally have the expectation that im calling them to help me with my issue but i think that ive learned that i need to have a course of action decided and just tell them what im going to do. 2 when we arrived at the gate there was a slew of people in the jetway to meet us the arff event commander inflight coordinator etc. i never got a chance to talk to the tug driver because he had unplugged and driven off and was gone to his next assignment before i got a chance to thank him or discuss the event. the collision was not his fault and i wanted to let him know that but to also let him know that it had to go in the aml. 3 the flight attendants were gone before i ever got a chance to thank them or debrief them. they elected not to continue with their trip and went home i think in the future i will make sure that i get the opportunity to debrief everybody but i was so busy talking to arff mechanics etc. that i never got the chance. 4 i have decided that in the future if i have to request priority handling once we land the trip will be over for me. i agreed to swap aircraft and fly the remainder of the flight and passengers to zzz2 because crew scheduling told us that once we got to zzz2 we would be done and could go to the hotel for the night. enroute they reassigned us to an additional leg after we got to zzz2. i was to deadhead on the flight to zzz and my first officer was to fly it. this makes for a very exhausting day when the first leg was a priority handling event and erodes the safety margin. the first officer told me that at airline y it is policy that if you request priority handling you are done and are removed from the rest of the trip. being a new hire on his first trip with airline x he didnt have the choice not to do the leg. i will not allow that to happen again.\n",
